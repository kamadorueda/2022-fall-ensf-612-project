    "body": "For example: `Set-ExecutionPolicy`.  This command should simply _not exist_ on Linux.  Rather than throwing `RuntimeErrorException` _**terminating** errors_, I would prefer to get a command-not found, because that's something I can test for _ahead of time_.\n\nYears of developing for moving targets on the web has taught us that the right way to avoid features that don't exist is to **test for the feature**, and _not_ for the underlying OS, Architecture, or software version, because you never know when someone's going to finally figure out how to implement something.\n\nIf non-functioning commands are not **hidden**, there is no easy, fast way for scripts to test for whether commands will work -- you have to run them and catch the exception. However, many scripters will _instead_ write incorrect conditional code _based on the PSEdition_ (or operating system sniffing, but currently that's not even in `$PSVersionTable` #1997)  which will prevent them from using the feature in the case where it's added later on.\n\nIn general, when a (core) module exposes a command (functioning or not), it's more difficult for _another_ module to provide an implementation -- I know we can't anyway in this particular example, but that's the problem with picking examples ;-)\n## Suggestion: This should be exposed in the manifest.\n\nI would like an easy way to identify commands that should be exported _based on **PSEdition**, **PSVersion**, **OS**, or **Architecture**_ from the module manifest.\n\nI don't want to have to wrap binary modules in script modules to put conditional Export-ModuleManifest statements in ... especially since putting the _right_ values in the manifest for exported cmdlets is vital to discoverability.\n\nOne thought is to allow specific module manifests for platforms, like `MyModule.Core-Linux.psd1` or something -- this would provide solutions to other design problems as well (like loading the right binary assemblies).\n",

    "body": "I'm super excited about the release of PowerShell for Mac and Linux--congrats!\n\nHowever, I ran into some trouble trying to use Nuget commands. Lots of documentation on NuGet packages seems to assume that you're using Windows and the VS Package Manager Console, so I was looking forward to being able to follow these sorts of examples in a straightforward manner when developing for ASP.Net on OSX (example: adding a package to my project through the command line, like `Install-Package <Package-Name>`)\n\nHere's what I did, hoping it would work...\n- Installed PowerShell using .pkg installer on OS X\n- Opened a terminal and entered `powershell`\n- Typed `Install-Package -ListAvailable`, which was [suggested ](https://docs.nuget.org/consume/package-manager-console) as something you could do with the Package Manager Console.\n- Got this error:\n  `Get-Package : A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'ListAvailable'.`\n\nSo it looks like the `Get-Package`command is something that PowerShell recognizes, but it doesn't behave the same way as it does in the VS Package Manager Console.\n\n@vors commented on this issue at @shanselman's [blog](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=0AB211CC-3B11-4FA9-8B04-774F1BF62B77#4b96c0a9-07f7-4789-9bad-4604df0f3d5a):\n\n> PowerShell nuget package manager (the one from Visual Studio) has cmdlet's name collisions with PowerShellGet (PS package manager), which you run in PowerShell on OS X. They essentially provide the same functionality for different scopes (project vs the whole system), but available parameters are different. It's indeed confusing, we are sorry.\n\nI'm kind of new to PowerShell, so I don't know if making this work would require changes with PowerShell itself, or if there is something I can do to my configuration let it know that I want to behave similar to the VS Package Manager Console. Any ideas?\n",

    "body": "On Windows, I was able to connect to HTTPS endpoints with invalid certificates by setting a certificate policy via System.Net.ServicePointManager to ignore invalid certificates. \n\nAn integrated way to ignore invalid certificates with `Invoke-RestMethod` and `Invoke-WebMethod` would simplify implementing this cross platform.\n\nWhen I run the same on Mac OS X, I get several errors regarding .NET dependencies. How can Invoke-RestMethod and Invoke-WebMethod be configured to ignore invalid certificates?\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n``` powershell\nadd-type @\"\nusing System.Net;\nusing System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;\npublic class TrustAllCertsPolicy : ICertificatePolicy {\n    public bool CheckValidationResult(\n        ServicePoint srvPoint, X509Certificate certificate,\n        WebRequest request, int certificateProblem) {\n            return true;\n        }\n }\n\"@\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::CertificatePolicy = New-Object TrustAllCertsPolicy\nInvoke-WebRequest https://expired.badssl.com/\n```\n## Expected behavior\n\nThis is from Windows Server 2008R2 with PowerShell 5:\n\n``` powershell\nPS C:\\>             add-type @\"\n>>                     using System.Net;\n>>                     using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates;\n>>                     public class TrustAllCertsPolicy : ICertificatePolicy {\n>>                        public bool CheckValidationResult(\n>>                             ServicePoint srvPoint, X509Certificate certificate,\n>>                             WebRequest request, int certificateProblem) {\n>>                             return true;\n>>                         }\n>>                     }\n>> \"@\n>>\nPS C:\\> [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::CertificatePolicy = New-Object TrustAllCertsPolicy\nPS C:\\> Invoke-WebRequest https://expired.badssl.com/\n\n\nStatusCode        : 200\nStatusDescription : OK\nContent           : <!DOCTYPE html>\n                    <html>\n                    <head>\n                      <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\">\n                      <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href=\"/icons/favicon-red.ico\"/>\n                      <link rel=\"apple-touch-icon\" href=\"/i...\nRawContent        : HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n                    Connection: keep-alive\n                    Accept-Ranges: bytes\n                    Content-Length: 469\n                    Cache-Control: no-store\n                    Content-Type: text/html\n                    Date: Fri, 19 Aug 2016 08:36:02 GMT\n                    ETag: \"57b263a4-1d5\"\n                    Last-Mo...\nForms             : {}\nHeaders           : {[Connection, keep-alive], [Accept-Ranges, bytes], [Content-Length, 469], [Cache-Control,\n                    no-store]...}\nImages            : {}\nInputFields       : {}\nLinks             : {}\nParsedHtml        : mshtml.HTMLDocumentClass\nRawContentLength  : 469\n```\n## Actual behavior\n\n``` powershell\nPS /Users/ffeldhaus>             add-type @\"                                                                                                                                                                                                  >>                     using System.Net;

In other distributions it can be installed as http://flatpak.org/getting.html    . This flatpak format is the most promising and buzzword of the packaging formats)\n\n2) the debian stable .deb = currently debian linux stable is 8.5 ( see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian )\n# \n\nnote: you may automate creation of the pre-built binaries formats using travis CI + github\n( see https://cylonjs.com/blog/2014/11/19/creating-multiplatform-precompiled-binaries-for-node-modules/  )\n\nif you can support **only one** additional format, then support flatpak and drop debian stable .deb\n",

Now, on Windows, I normally consume Powershell from within Emacs thanks to the amazing Powershell Mode[1]. On Linux, this did not work so well, with the shell failing to start. Whilst trying to get to the bottom of this, I decided to start Powershell within Emacs via bash and I got the following rather strange behaviour:\n\n```\n $ /usr/bin/powershell\nPowerShell \nCopyright (C) 2016 Microsoft Corporation.
