This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their scripts and module correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a security vulnerability in the open source versions of PowerShell Core where an attacker could present a certificate that is marked invalid for a specific use, but a .NET Core component uses it for that purpose. This action disregards the Enhanced Key Usage tagging.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that .NET Core components completely validate certificates.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update their PowerShell Core to version 6.0.1.  This version will also address CVE-2018-0764.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects PowerShell Core prior to version `6.0.1`\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. Run `pwsh -v` (if, you cannot launch PowerShell Core using `pwsh` you are affected).  If the reported version starts with `6.0.0`, you are affected.\r\n1. You also use one of the .NET assemblies referenced in https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/51\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Get PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization. This is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/. The Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core. This should be treated as a temporary measure. Therefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0786](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0786)\r\n\r\n",

This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their scripts and module correctly.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a Denial of Service vulnerability in the open source versions of PowerShell Core when improper processing of XML documents by .NET Core occurs. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against a .NET application. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to an application using PowerShell to process requests.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET core handles XML document processing.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update PowerShell Core to version 6.0.1. This version will also address CVE-2018-0786.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects PowerShell Core prior to version `6.0.1`\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. Run `pwsh -v` (if, you cannot launch PowerShell Core using `pwsh` you are affected).  If the reported version starts with `6.0.0`, you are affected.\r\n1. You are using PowerShell to parse XML.\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Get PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core, please email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization. This is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/. The Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements) will contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core. This should be treated as a temporary measure. Therefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0764](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0764)\r\n",

There is an older unanswered question with a different version (this one is Version=6.0.0.0).\r\n\r\nI did report this in stackoverflow and received a comment that pssnapins were deprecated. \r\n[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48388451/installing-powershell-sql-server-module-fails-in-6-0-could-not-load-type-system](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48388451/installing-powershell-sql-server-module-fails-in-6-0-could-not-load-type-system)\r\n`\r\n`**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript start\r\nStart time: 20180122124038\r\nUsername: bakery\\sunshine\r\nRunAs User: bakery\\sunshine\r\nConfiguration Name: \r\nMachine: BAKERY (Microsoft Windows NT 6.2.9200.0)\r\nHost Application: C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0\\pwsh.dll\r\nProcess ID: 9272\r\n**PSVersion: 6.0.0**\r\nPSEdition: Core\r\nGitCommitId: v6.0.0\r\nOS: Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299 \r\nPlatform: Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions: 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1.10032.0, 6.0.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion: 2.3\r\nSerializationVersion: 1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion: 3.0\r\n**********************\r\nTranscript started, output file is trans1.txt\r\nPS C:\\Users\\sunshine\\desktop> $psversiontable\r\n\r\n    Name                           Value\r\n    ----                           -----\r\n    PSVersion                      6.0.0\r\n    PSEdition                      Core\r\n    GitCommitId                    v6.0.0\r\n    OS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\n    Platform                       Win32NT\r\n    PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\n    PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\n    SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n    WSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Users\\sunshine\\desktop> install-module sqlserver -verbose\r\n    VERBOSE: Acquiring providers for assembly: C:\\program files\\powershell\\6.0.0\\Modules\\PackageManagement\\1.1.7.0\\coreclr\\netcoreapp2.0\\Microsoft.PackageManagement.NuGetProvider.dll\r\n    VERBOSE: Acquiring providers for assembly: C:\\program files\\powershell\\6.0.0\\Modules\\PackageManagement\\1.1.7.0\\coreclr\\netcoreapp2.0\\Microsoft.PackageManagement.CoreProviders.dll\r\n    VERBOSE: Acquiring providers for assembly: C:\\program files\\powershell\\6.0.0\\Modules\\PackageManagement\\1.1.7.0\\coreclr\\netcoreapp2.0\\Microsoft.PackageManagement.MetaProvider.PowerShell.dll\r\n    VERBOSE: Acquiring providers for assembly: C:\\program files\\powershell\\6.0.0\\Modules\\PackageManagement\\1.1.7.0\\coreclr\\netcoreapp2.0\\Microsoft.PackageManagement.ArchiverProviders.dll\r\n    VERBOSE: Using the provider 'PowerShellGet' for searching packages.\r\n    VERBOSE: The -Repository parameter was not specified.

It basically re-uses the existing custom dialog and adds 2 new checkboxes to run run `RegisterManifest.ps1` and `Enable-PSRemoting` (with the first one being ticked by default) using the installed pwsh.exe.\r\nQuestions to be discussed include e.g. how should pwsh.exe be called and how error should be handled. Currently PowerShell errors are getting ignored by WiX.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nNote: Please mark anything not applicable to this PR `NA`.\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [x] Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] User facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [x] Issue filed - Issue link: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2007\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n    - [feature] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).

A core implementation should support the standard `-Encoding` parameter etc.\r\n\r\nThis is unlikely to create a maintenance burden because it just calls into .NET and the Base64 spec will not change.",

Otherwise, they should be on by default, IMO.\r\n\r\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/PowerShell/powershell-f975h\r\n\r\n```none\r\nTEST FAILURES\r\nDescription: Validate Update-Help for module 'PSReadLine'\r\nName:        Validate Update-Help from the Web for all PowerShell Core modules...Validate Update-Help for module 'PSReadLine'\r\nmessage:\r\nExpected: {1}\r\nBut was:  {0}\r\nstack-trace:\r\nat line: 157 in C:\\projects\\powershell-f975h\\test\\powershell\\engine\\Help\\UpdatableHelpSystem.Tests.ps1\r\n157:     $helpFilesInstalled.Count | Should Be $expectedHelpFiles.Count\r\nDescription: Validate Update-Help for module 'PSReadLine'\r\nName:        Validate Update-Help -SourcePath for all PowerShell Core modules...Validate Update-Help for module 'PSReadLine'\r\nmessage:\r\nExpected: {1}\r\nBut was:  {0}\r\nstack-trace:\r\nat line: 157 in C:\\projects\\powershell-f975h\\test\\powershell\\engine\\Help\\UpdatableHelpSystem.Tests.ps1\r\n157:     $helpFilesInstalled.Count | Should Be $expectedHelpFiles.Count\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/PowerShell/PowerShell/jobs/331386328\r\n\r\n```none\r\nTEST FAILURES\r\nDescription: Validate Update-Help from the Web for all PowerShell Core modules./\r\nName:        Validate Update-Help for module 'PSReadLine'\r\nmessage:\r\nExpected: {1}\r\nBut was:  {0}\r\nstack-trace:\r\nat line: 157 in /home/travis/build/PowerShell/PowerShell/test/powershell/engine/Help/UpdatableHelpSystem.Tests.ps1\r\n157:     $helpFilesInstalled.Count | Should Be $expectedHelpFiles.Count\r\nDescription: Validate Update-Help -SourcePath for all PowerShell Core modules./\r\nName:        Validate Update-Help for module 'PSReadLine'\r\nmessage:\r\nExpected: {1}\r\nBut was:  {0}\r\nstack-trace:\r\nat line: 157 in /home/travis/build/PowerShell/PowerShell/test/powershell/engine/Help/UpdatableHelpSystem.Tests.ps1\r\n157:     $helpFilesInstalled.Count | Should Be $expectedHelpFiles.Count\r\nDescription: ConsoleHost unit tests/Redirected standard input for 'interactive' use\r\nName:        Interactive redirected input: \r\nmessage:\r\nExpected string length 7 but was 125.

Nested collections are treated as a single value and converted accordingly.\r\n* `-Form` is mutually exclusive with `-Body` and `-InFile`\r\n* Per committee decision, `-Form` makes no assumptions about the HTTP method used. It can theoretically be used with any method. User will need to manually supply `-Method POST` to post the form.\r\n* `-ContentType` and content related headers supplied to `-Headers` will be ignored/cleared as `MultipartFormDataContent` requires control of these headers.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nNote: Please mark anything not applicable to this PR `NA`.\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [X] Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] User facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [X] Issue filed - Issue link: PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs#2077\r\n- [X] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n    - [X] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n",

Well, I'd love to test out fixes as they go out, instead of waiting for new releases, but I also don't want to break the install of PowerShell Core on my Mac. Since I have Docker for Mac installed, the easiest way to test out new features is to pull the nightly container image, and run PowerShell Core inside of a Docker container. This will not impact my \"main\" install of PowerShell Core, while providing the ability to test out new features and contribute feedback back to the project.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1392\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-19 at 9 45 51 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/466713/35164086-cb306ff6-fcfd-11e7-8a5d-712cd12baaca.png\">\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTrevor Sullivan",

I installed it all ok, log into Powershellusing 'pwsh' and tried to add a module however it doesn't seem to want to be added. \r\nModule: ```Save-Module -Name HPOneView.400 -Path /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0 ```\r\nwhich states: “command was found in the module '<ModuleName>', but the module could not be loaded\"\r\n\r\nCan this be done via a Linux instance or can I only add modules in a Windows instance of Powershell?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance",

    "body": "Consider the following enum that resides in a deeply-nested namespace:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nAdd-Type @'\r\nnamespace Some { namespace Deeply { namespace NestedNamespace {\r\n    public enum AnEnum {\r\n        One = 1,\r\n        Two,\r\n        Three,\r\n        Four\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n}\r\n}\r\n'@\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"One\" can be accessed from the enum using the fully-qualified type as follows:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n[Some.Deeply.NestedNamespace.AnEnum]::One\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe length of the namespace prefixes make use of the enum awkward.  PowerShell involving such enums quickly becomes dominated by repetition of `Some.Deeply.NestedNamespace`.  Here is a snippet that demostrates this.  (I copied this from a current project, and just changed the token names.):\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n    if\r\n    (\r\n        $PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName -ne 'parameterSetA' -and\r\n        $ParamA -notin [Some.Deeply.NestedNamespace.AnEnum]::One,[Some.Deeply.NestedNamespace.AnEnum]::Two\r\n    )\r\n    {\r\n        $someVar= @{\r\n            [Some.Deeply.NestedNamespace.AnEnum]::Three = [System.Exception]::new('message.')\r\n            [Some.Deeply.NestedNamespace.AnEnum]::Four= [System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord]::new(\r\n                [System.Exception]::new('message.'),\r\n                'Error',\r\n                [System.Management.Automation.ErrorCategory]::OperationStopped,\r\n                $null\r\n            )\r\n        }.$ParamA\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, this could be rewritten making use of type accelerators as follows:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n    if\r\n    (\r\n        $PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName -ne 'parameterSetA' -and\r\n        $ParamA -notin [anenum]::One,[anenum]::Two\r\n    )\r\n    {\r\n        $someVar= @{\r\n            [anenum]::Three = [exception]::new('message.')\r\n            [anenum]::Four= [errorrecord]::new(\r\n                [System.Exception]::new('message.'),\r\n                'Error',\r\n                [errorcategory]::OperationStopped,\r\n                $null\r\n            )\r\n        }.$ParamA\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n[`Add-TypeAccelerator.ps1`](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Add-Type-Accelerators-to-b59908eb) is available from gallery.  It looks like the API used to add custom type accelerators was changed from PowerShell 2 to 3 and again from PowerShell 4 to 5.  This makes me wonder the following:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a _supported_ way for users to create type accelerators?\r\n2. Is there some other way to reduce namespace repetition when referring to types?",

PowerShell should be smart enough not to throw the error and to just go on executing the code. In other words, in the code above `$switch2` is the intersection of `set2` and `set3` and it's not ambiguous since there are no mandatory parameters in `set2` or `set3`: ambiguities should only occur when having no other choice than adopting a specific parameter set in presence of mandatory parameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
