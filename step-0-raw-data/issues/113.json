    "body": "I was talking to @BrucePay about the idea of supporting [bool]\"false\" resolving to the boolean value $False.\r\n\r\nThis mainly affects when calling PowerShell scripts from DSLs and other shells.  There is no problem with this when calling a powershell script from powershell as it understands it's own boolean type.\r\n\r\nI am mainly interested in [bool]\"false\" resolving to $False.  I don't have strong feelings on whether to change the behavior [bool]\"anyotherstring\" resolving to \"true\".\r\n\r\nThese are some of the issues this would seem to help with:\r\n- DSLs that commonly use the string \"true\" when they do not have a true boolean (e.g. CloudFormation)\r\n- The problem of passing booleans across shells because there is no standard \"boolean\" type between shells\r\n- The problem of composing powershell command lines in code that use powershell switches - omitting or including the switch depending on the desired result is a pain.  Being able to always specify the switch , but control it's value with a variable makes things a lot less complex.\r\n\r\nIn some cases this *could* be resolved with using 0 and 1 - but the other problem is extant code and coding skills - for example for me to get everyone in our huge organization to change their true / false strings to 0 and 1 is a monumental effort that would never fully take.  Just fixing this in PowerShell would mean not having to re-code people's defacto practices.",

Sets `ContentType` to `application/json`\r\n\r\n    The intend is to make sending JSON as easy as sending a form, given it's the more often used format for APIs.\r\n    Example name: `JsonBody`\r\n\r\n#### Inspired by Curl and especially intended for REPL:\r\n\r\n- Add aliases for all or at least the commonly used parameters. Aliases, unlike partial names, provide certainty and have a short display form at the same time. Some might match with Curl if applicable.\r\nExample: `b` and/or `d` for `Body`, `ua` for `UserAgent`\r\n\r\n- If `Uri` lacks the protocol, attach `http://` automatically.\r\n",

Currently, `Import-Module` fails to load the module if this character\r\nexists as the current logic incorrectly uses `GetFileName` to get the last part of the path which returns\r\nan empty string if the path ends in a directory separator.\r\n\r\nFix is to update the code path that tries to load a module given a directory path and removes the\r\ntrailing directory character, if present, so that the logic to expect the module filename to be the same\r\nas the module directory name works.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5533\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

Now, a check is made on whether stripping the drive name and colon results in an empty string; if it does, the root of the current PSDrive `context.Drive.Root` is returned as the relative path.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #5228.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed - Issue link: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5228#\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

    "body": "Hello\r\n\r\nUsually, the `-verbose` switch is used if one would like to get more information about _one_ module or script.\r\nThe reality is, however, that we're flooded with verbose messages.\r\n\r\nTherefore it would be great if `-verbose` could be controlled. Just two ideas:\r\n\r\n- By specifying a nesting level, e.g. `-Verbose <NestingLevel>`\r\n`-Verbose 2` would activate verbose messages in the directly called script and in all commands which are called by the script itself.\r\n- By specifying a script / module filter, e.g. `-Verbose @('Build.ps1', 'Invoke-Build')`\r\nThis would activate verbose messages in the script `Build.ps1` and in the command `Invoke-Build` itself.\r\n\r\nKind regards, \r\nThomas\r\n",

Now, a check is made on whether stripping the drive name and colon results in an empty string; if it does, the root of the current PSDrive `context.Drive.Root` is returned as the relative path.\r\n\r\nThis fixes #5228.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed - Issue link: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5228#\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

    "body": "Note:   \r\n* This proposal arose out of the discussion in #6512  \r\n* An RFC would have to be written, but I first want to see if there's a fundamental willingness to implement this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe ~~hidden~~ and effectively undocumented `.Where()` and `.ForEach` _methods_ available on every object exposed by PowerShell were introduced to support DSC in v4 and provide functionality similar to the `Where-Object` and `ForEach-Object` cmdlets, but (a) in a more performant way (albeit in an all-in-memory way)  and (b) with more features. The most comprehensive documentation that I'm aware of is [this blog post by @KirkMunro](http://www.powershellmagazine.com/2014/10/22/foreach-and-where-magic-methods/).\r\n\r\nWhile they could simple be documented (and made more discoverable), **I suggest surfacing them as bona fide PowerShell _operators_ `-foreach` and `-where`**:\r\n\r\n* No _native_ PowerShell features  that I am aware of are exposed as _methods_: instead, functionality is surfaced as _commands_ (cmdlets/functions) and _operators_.\r\n\r\n  * Methods belong to a _different realm_, to which [`Get-Help about_Methods`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Methods.md) is the portal (albeit one that, unfortunately, currently doesn't discuss syntax pitfalls and doesn't even reference [`Get-Help about_Parsing`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Parsing.md)); it's a powerful realm and definitely worth knowing about, but it is a different realm, distinct from how PowerShell itself surfaces its functionality.\r\n\r\n* The `.Where()` and `.ForEach()` methods were introduced as such for the benefit of _DSC_ - ~~of necessity, I presume, given that the DSC DSL doesn't allow use of _pipelines_~~ (see comments below).\r\n\r\n   * Despite their general availability inside PowerShell itself, they're effectively undocumented, and many people may not even be aware of their existence (since ~~tab completion doesn't help~~ (see comments below), and neither `Get-Member` nor `.psobject.Methods` find them, you simply have to _know_ of their existence).\r\n\r\n   * Even if fully documented (and, as discussed, this is currently even lacking in the _DSC_ context, and overall Kirk's blog post is still the most complete documentation), these methods make awkward tools in general PowerShell use, due to their method syntax and output data types.\r\n\r\nHence my suggestion to **surface them as _operators_ with `[object[]]` output**, which would make them discoverable interactively (`-<tab>`) , and they would be documented alongside the existing operators.\r\n\r\nThey'd make **concise complements to their cmdlet counterparts**; `-foreach` would make the `foreach` _loop_ unnecessary in many situations and with its use of `$_` reduce the existing confusion between the loop and the cmdlet (see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/1514 and a rejected attempt to harmonize the two, #3830):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$var = 1, 2, 3 -foreach { $_ + 1 }  # wishful thinking\r\n\r\n# vs.\r\n\r\n$var = foreach ($i in 1, 2, 3) { $i + 1 }\r\n# or (slower)\r\n$var = 1, 2, 3 | ForEach-Object { $_ + 1 }\r\n\r\n#  ---\r\n\r\n$var = 1, 2, 3 -where { $_ -gt 1 } # wishful thinking\r\n\r\n# vs.\r\n# (slower)\r\n$var = 1, 2, 3 | Where-Object { $_ -gt 1 }\r\n# or\r\n$var = foreach ($i in 1, 2, 3)  { if ($i -gt 1) { $i } }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nArguably, even DSC could benefit from the cleaner operator syntax; contrast the following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Note that this example, taken from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/separatingenvdata\r\n# doesn't even use `()` around the script-block argument, so the use of Where() \r\n# isn't even readily recognizable as a *method* call.\r\nNode ($AllNodes.Where{$_.Role -eq \"WebServer\"}).NodeName { ...\r\n\r\n# vs.\r\n\r\nNode ($AllNodes -where {$_.Role -eq \"WebServer\"}).NodeName { ...  # wishful thinking\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWritten as of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nRelated to #5618\r\n\r\nTwo improvements:\r\n1. Avoid unnecessary reflection in `ConvertPSMethodInfoToDelegate`. `PSMethod` already has the `MethodInfo` information with its `adapterData` field.\r\n2. Avoid creating the generic `PSMethod<>` type for `PSMethod` that represents constructors, because constructors cannot be converted to a delegate anyways. In case that the `PSMethod` represents constructors, we use a simple `PSMethod` instance instead.\r\n\r\nAlso, rename the type `Unit` to `VOID` to make it more readable, since that type represents `typeof(void)`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

However, instead of directly calling the base methods, it calls the methods on a static instance of `DotNetAdapter`.\r\n2. Fix a typo in `EventManager.cs`.\r\n3. A clone is created but not used in `InitialSessionState.cs`.\r\n4. The property `InternalBaseDotNetAdapter` points to `InternalAdapterSet.DotNetAdapter`, so use `InternalBaseDotNetAdapter` to make the code more readable.\r\n5. The assignment is unnecessary in `SessionStateProviderAPIs.cs`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [x] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

(e.g. `C:\\PowerShell\\src\\powershell-win-core\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.0\\win7-x64`).\r\nThis also enables running `dotnet pwsh.dll` after building with `dotnet build`.\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\n1. The file `powershell.config.json` is not bin-placed to the output directory by the build, which might cause loading `PSReadline` to fail due to the execution policy.\r\n2. `Runspace.PrimaryRunspace` was set in `OpenConsoleRunspace` before the Runspace has been successfully opened. When the first attempt to open the default Runspace fails because of the failure to load `PSReadline`, `OpenConsoleRunspace` will be called again to open the Runspace without `PSReadline`, but `Runspace.PrimaryRunspace` has already been set and thus caused the crash. The fix is to set `Runspace.PrimaryRunspace` after the default Runspace has been opened.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

    "body": "The code introduced in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3885 seems to have introduced a regression bug which was quite hard to identify as the error message points to issues with the URI and not to anything related to redirection. [The code introduced in the pull request initializes an URI using the Location Header, without first checking if the Location Header is present in the response of a redirect.](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d20d53eaacafd4645ea668bd46e62093d3f3e503/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/Common/WebRequestPSCmdlet.Common.cs#L1310). The [HTTP RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.4) does not specify the Location Header to be mandatory and thus it's existence must be checked.\r\n\r\nI discovered this while checking strange PowerShell errors when issuing a GET or HEAD request against a AWS S3 Bucket while connecting to the wrong region. AWS S3 does respond with HTTP 301 but without a Location header.\r\n\r\nThe issue only occurs if the Server responds with a redirect HTTP Status Code 3XX and without the Location header and if the client has specified the Authorization Header in the initial request.\r\n\r\nThe issue can probably be fixed by modifying [line 1290](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d20d53eaacafd4645ea668bd46e62093d3f3e503/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/Common/WebRequestPSCmdlet.Common.cs#L1290) to `if (stripAuthorization && IsRedirectCode(response.StatusCode) && response.Headers.Location)`.\r\n\r\nI'd be glad to create a pull request to fix this issue if my analyzis is correct and the proposed change is the correct way to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe following simple HEAD request demonstrates the unexpected error message:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://s3.amazonaws.com/test-301-redirection/ -Method HEAD -Headers @{Authorization=\"test\"}                       \r\nInvoke-WebRequest : Value cannot be null.\r\nParameter name: uri\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://s3.amazonaws.com/test-301-redirection/ ...\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Invoke-WebRequest], ArgumentNullException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.ArgumentNullException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeWebRequestCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe response should be\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://s3.amazonaws.com/test-301-redirection/ -Method HEAD -Headers @{Authorization=\"test\"}                                                          \r\nInvoke-WebRequest : Response status code does not indicate success: 301 (Moved Permanently).\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://s3.amazonaws.com/test-301-redirection/ ...\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (Method: HEAD, R...rShell/6.0.2\r\n}:HttpRequestMessage) [Invoke-WebRequest], HttpResponseException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletWebResponseException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeWebRequestCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nA workaround is, to specify the `PreserveAuthorizationOnRedirect` Parameter which will skip the section introduced in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3885 :\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri https://s3.amazonaws.com/test-301-redirection/ -Method HEAD -Headers @{Authorization=\"test\"} -PreserveAuthorizationOnRedirect                                                                                                                                                                                             \r\nInvoke-WebRequest : Response status code does not indicate success: 301 (Moved Permanently).\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://s3.amazonaws.com/test-301-redirection/ ...\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (Method: HEAD, R...rShell/6.0.2\r\n}:HttpRequestMessage) [Invoke-WebRequest], HttpResponseException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : WebCmdletWebResponseException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeWebRequestCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$PSVersionTable                                                                                                                           \r\n\r\nName                           Value                                                                                                                                                                  \r\n----                           -----                                                                                                                                                                  \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.2                                                                                                                                                                  \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                                                                                                                                                   \r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.2                                                                                                                                                                 \r\nOS                             Darwin 17.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.4.0: Sun Dec 17 09:19:54 PST 2017;

    "body": "The following code starts a job that outputs an integer once a second.  Subscriptions for some of the job's events are established.  The output of the job is polled by calling `Receive-Job` periodically until the job stops running.

I have also noticed that the `.Output` member of jobs seems to always be empty.\r\n\r\nThis leaves me with the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is a way of subscribing to or waiting on new data that is added to a job without polling?\r\n2. Why is no `DataAdded` event published when the above code is run?  In what conditions is that event published?\r\n3. Why is the `.Output` property of a job object always empty?  In what conditions is that property populated?",
