Then the already filtered leaves (in the example, all started with \"p\") is passed to a code which again filters the leaves by WindcardPattern.IsMatch(). So (1) we don't filter large, all full path list, only small collection of leaves  - that's why we get so little acceleration, (2) we do duplicated work that we would address, I believe it is common problem in globbing code - there is many places where it happens.\r\n\r\nSo it's possible our globing code is doing duplicate filtering, and it would be an optimization opportunity.",

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nI would like more information about the last _ReadLine_ command that was executed. I'm primarily thinking about tooling enhancements for interactive scenarios (in particular for customising `Prompt`), but I can think of a bunch of other uses for this information.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking this `$LastCommand` automatic variable should serve a similar role to `$MyInvocation`.  However, unlike `$MyInvocation`, `$LastCommand` information would be available after the command had run, and not be overwritten in a function call. \r\n\r\n`$LastCommand` should basically be supplied every time the `Prompt` function needs to be invoked.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nAfter every \"read line\" command is executed, set the `$global:LastCommand` automatic variable is set to an object, with the following fields:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@{\r\n  # The command that ReadLine/PSReadLine asked PowerShell to run\r\n  [string]Command = \"..\"\r\n  # Time spent executing the command (similar to what is stored in Get-History items at the moment\r\n  # but it will also work for commands that are not added to history for some reason\r\n  [TimeSpan]Elapsed = ...\r\n  # A list of the exit codes for any native commands that were run (there could be many)\r\n  [int[]]ExitCodes = @(...)\r\n  # Like $Error but scoped to the last command\r\n  [ErrorRecord[]]$Error\r\n  # Like $? but better\r\n  Status = \"OK\"\r\n  # Link to history for some useful synergies, or null if not added\r\n  [int]HistoryId = 123\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the real drawcard here is `Status`. It would be an Enum/string that could capture all of PowerShell's diverse forms of error:\r\n\r\n- \"OK\"/\"Completed\" indicated a command/pipeline indicated without any failures\r\n- \"CompletedWithErrors\" would reflect a pipeline that completed but still populated the `$Error` record (e.g. in cases of `SilentlyContinue`)\r\n- \"Failed\" where a terminating error (like `throw`) stops execution\r\n- \"Cancelled\" when `ctrl+c` stops execution\r\n- \"Empty\" - not sure if this one is necessary but it would reflect cases where `ReadLine` was supplied an empty string and the effective command was a noop\r\n- ... and any I missed\r\n\r\n\r\n# Alternatives\r\n\r\n## Why not `$?`\r\n\r\n- `$?` is dismissed as soon as you run any other command. This an issue others have run into:\r\n  - https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9363\r\n  - https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/blob/a64e5e073f6ce4dcd01394965bf0bbc91a0e3016/src/posh-git.psm1#L32\r\n- `$?` is not always updated. Especially when a ReadLine is cancelled, or is an empty string\r\n\r\n## Why not `$Error`\r\n\r\nBecause it doesn't capture cancelled commands, empty commands, or native commands.\r\n\r\n## Why not `$LASTEXITCODE`\r\n\r\n`$LASTEXITCODE` is only set when native commands run. But annoyingly, the value is not automatically dismissed. In Bash this is not a big deal (I think) because every command executed has an exit code that updates last exit code (again, mostly speculation). However, in PowerShell, if you run a native command, then run a PowerShell command, which may fail or succeed, then checking the $LASTEXITCODE is misleading. It does represent the last exit code of the last native tool that was run, but this may not be the last user-supplied command or even the last 10 commands.\r\n\r\nThis is not a big deal in a script, because an author understands this context. But from a tooling perspective, there's no way to understand what just happened unless you start parsing the supplied command. I figure PowerShell could do this for me.\r\n\r\n## Why not use Get-History or augment it with new fields\r\n\r\n`Get-History` is great but its goal is not well aligned with providing information about the user's last command. Get-History actually supplies information about the last command, that is not a duplicate, and that was not cancelled, or an empty string...\r\n\r\nI'm interested in what happens in and around a user typing a command. Get-History I think shouldn't capture all the information in my proposal and just continue recording history.\r\n\r\n# Open questions\r\n\r\n- The name `$LastCommand` is IMO nice, but probably a poor choice. Other choices:\r\n  - `$LastReadline`\r\n  - `$LastPrompt`\r\n  - `$LastResult`\r\n- The names, types, and variables in the `$LastCommand` could all probably be improved\r\n- I'm only thinking about an interactive scenario. I'm not sure my suggestion has any meaning inside a script...\r\n- If it is only useful in interactive scenarios, it could be supplied to the `Prompt` function as an argument, rather than being set as a global variable\r\n- I'm not wholly familiar with all the types of errors\r\n- There is a security concern with getting access to the commands that were run, but it is no worse than hijacking PSReadLine's  `[Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::GetBufferState` method anyway.\r\n\r\n# Related links\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9363\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7853\r\n  - A similar idea, that got derailed with a non-solution\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9140",

    "body": "Microsoft has a great product, that is windows admin center(WAC), it use PS to connect target, but there is one shortage, it instruct PS to use its default behavior (use port 5985) to connect target , do not have an option to instruct PS to use port 80 or 443 (Compatibility mode) to connect target.\r\n\r\nIn my environment , PS can reach target via port 80 only. For this problem ,I already post a request in WAC user voice -- https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/295071-management-tools/suggestions/38030116-connect-client-via-port-80\r\n\r\nhttps://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/295071-management-tools/suggestions/33981802--configuration-winrm-connect-using-non-default\r\n\r\nAs only a few users have that demand , so WAC team did nothing for my request.\r\n\r\nBut if I can change PS's default behavior -- use port 80 as default , then my WAC problem will go way.\r\n\r\nAny one can provide me a good solution ?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!",

    "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis is the first feature of [RFC002](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/2-Draft-Accepted/RFC0002-Generalized-Splatting.md) for enhanced splatting.\r\nAs agreed in the accepted RFC, one should not need to declare a variable in order to splat. This PR adds the ability to definite the splatted hashtable in the same line as the command. As discussed, the `@@` has to be introduced to differentiate from the scenario where the 1st argument is a hashtable.\r\n\r\nThe scenario that this PR enables is:\r\n```pwsh\r\nGet-ChildItem @@{Path='C:\\'; Filter=$filter}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the new `At`  `TokenKind`  in order to be able the parse the syntax and adds a public `Splatted` property to `HashTableAst` so that the compiler knows at runtime that the argument is splatted.\r\n\r\nThe experimental feature `PSGeneralizedSplatting` is created for it. Although there are switch statements using the new `At` that are not guarded by an if check for this experimental feature (which was not possible due to the flow analysis of C# resulting in a compiler error), this is OK because the experimental feature flag prevents the tokenizer from creating an `At` token in the first place.\r\n\r\nA semantic check was added so that the only implemented use case is using `@@{` as an argument to a command, therefore the user will get an actionable error when trying to use it in another context, e.g. for a .Net method or a hashtable as `@@{'key='value'}` to conform with previous behaviour (where the tokenizer returned an error in those cases). I've also checked it does not impact using `@@` inside a function name (even before a function name could not start with `@@` so no change here).\r\n\r\nThis PR does not add tab completion functionality to the keys of the splatted hashtable. This is something that is not present at the moment anyway with splatted variables and is a separate enhancement that one could add in another PR, as well as other features in the RFC. The goal of this RFC is to implement just 1 feature in this RFC that adds value, therefore making it a minimum viable feature.\r\n\r\nI added tests for existing and new splatting functionality and error cases.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/2-Draft-Accepted/RFC0002-Generalized-Splatting.md\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [x] Experimental feature name: `PSGeneralizedSplatting`\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",

For example, consider these empty command definitions:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-Mandatory {\r\n    param(\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory, ParameterSetName='StringTest')]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $String,\r\n\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory, ParameterSetName='ObjectTest')]\r\n        [object]\r\n        $Object\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Test-Validator {\r\n    param(\r\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $String,\r\n\r\n        [ValidateNotNull()]\r\n        [object]\r\n        $Object\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen a parameter is marked as `Mandatory`, if it's a string, it cannot be empty. If it's a non-value type object, it cannot be null. That's built in behavior. Command authors can also add `ValidatNotNullOrEmpty` or `ValidateNotNull` validators that ensure that a parameter is not null or empty, or not null, respectively. These are more or less the same thing: logic to ensure that non-null or non-empty values are provided to parameters; however, the error messages returned to users are not consistent and not necessarily as clear as they should be. Below are some command invocations along with the errors that are produced in PowerShell Core 6.2.1 today. Note that these are just the error message -- the command name, position and other details have been stripped.\r\n\r\n|Command|Error Message|\r\n|--|--|\r\n|`Test-Mandatory -String $null`|`Cannot bind argument to parameter 'String' because it is an empty string.`|\r\n|`Test-Mandatory -Object $null`|`Cannot bind argument to parameter 'Object' because it is null.`|\r\n|`Test-Validator -String $null`|`Cannot validate argument on parameter 'String'. The argument is null or empty. Provide an argument that is not null or empty, and then try the command again.`|\r\n|`Test-Validator -Object $null`|`Cannot validate argument on parameter 'Object'. The argument is null. Provide a valid value for the argument, and then try running the command again.`|\r\n\r\nThe message that each of these errors tries to convey to the caller is that they provided an invalid value into a parameter, and sometimes they suggest what should be done while encouraging them to try again. Unfortunately, the error message that appears does not actually convey that message very well.\r\n\r\n`Cannot bind argument to parameter...`\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the parameter binder was unable to bind the value provided to a certain parameter, the end user doesn't need to know those technical details.\r\n\r\n`Cannot validate argument on parameter...`\r\n\r\nThese error messages are misleading, and could sound like PowerShell was unable to perform the validation on a parameter value.\r\n\r\n`...because it is an empty string.`\r\n\r\nThis does not properly cover the case where `$null` is accidentally passed into a mandatory string parameter, which is not helpful to end users.\r\n\r\nAlso, the `Mandatory` error messages do not suggest the user try again, but the `Validator` error messages do.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, these error messages should be clear, consistent, and since PowerShell is used interactively in a shell, directed towards the end user so that they can more easily correct the problem.\r\n\r\nI propose that we change the error messages for the commands shown above to the messages shown below instead.\r\n\r\n|Command|Error Message|\r\n|--|--|\r\n|`Test-Mandatory -String $null`|`The null or empty value provided for the 'String' parameter is invalid. Try running the command again with a value for the 'String' parameter that is not null or empty.`|\r\n|`Test-Mandatory -Object $null`|`The null value provided for the 'Object' parameter is invalid. Try running the command again with a value for the 'Object' parameter that is not null.`|\r\n|`Test-Validator -String $null`|`The null or empty value provided for the 'String' parameter is invalid. Try running the command again with a value for the 'String' parameter that is not null or empty.`|\r\n|`Test-Validator -Object $null`|`The null value provided for the 'Object' parameter is invalid. Try running the command again with a value for the 'Object' parameter that is not null.`|\r\n\r\nThese messages are targeted towards the end user who is invoking the command, consistent regardless of whether the parameter is `Mandatory` or using a `ValidateNotNull` or `ValidateNotNullOrEmpty` validator, they clearly identify the problem, and they tell the user what to do to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nBetter, yes?\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

Memory profiling of `$null = 1..3e5 | % { 1+1 }` shows huge allocation of ``System.Tuple`2`` and the boxed enum type `S.M.A.ConfigScope`. (See below)\r\nThey are resulted by the policy setting cache we chose for GPO: `ConcurrentDictionary<Tuple<ConfigScope, string>, PolicyBase>`. Every time we query for the GPO policy settings, an instance of `Tuple<ConfigScope, string>` has to be created. The created `Tuple` object is also short-living, only for the querying purpose. When the tuple is used as a key for querying, the enum value gets boxed for equality comparison and hash code calculation, because ``Tuple`2`` uses `EqualityComparer<object>.Default` as the comparer which treat items of the tuple as `object` (see [``Tuple`2.Equals()``](https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Tuple.cs,219) and [``Tuple`2.GetHashCode()``](https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/shared/System/Tuple.cs,259)).\r\nTo avoid those unnecessary allocations, the cache for GPO is changed to `ConcurrentDictionary<ConfigScope, ConcurrentDictionary<string, PolicyBase>>` to avoid using `Tuple` as the key.\r\n\r\n2. Add code in `CompiledScriptBlock.cs` to skip calling `LogScriptBlockCreation` when logging is skipped.\r\n\r\n3. Add a secondary cache for `ScriptBlockLogging` setting in `CompiledScriptBlock.cs` and a secondary cache for `Transcription` setting in `MshHostUserInterface.cs`, because they are used very frequently.\r\n\r\n4. Memory profiling shows `28 mb` allocation of `System.Boolean`. This is caused by passing a bool value to a `object` type parameter when writing tracing message in `ParameterBinder`.\r\n\r\n5. Memory profiling shows `28 mb` allocation of a closure class `<>c_DisplayClass55_0`. This is caused by [this piece of code](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/lang/scriptblock.cs#L978-L989). This is a hot code path and thus results in a lot allocation of the auto-generated closure. The `RunActionIfNoRunningPipelinesWithThreadCheck` method is refactored to avoid passing a delegate around.\r\n\r\n#### Before the changes\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/60524110-d55f3e00-9ca0-11e9-93c7-578545f3db99.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS> Measure-Command { 1..1e5 | % { 1+1 } > $null }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 508\r\nTicks             : 5085940\r\nTotalDays         : 5.88650462962963E-06\r\nTotalHours        : 0.000141276111111111\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.00847656666666667\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.508594\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 508.594\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### After the changes\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/60528874-41926f80-9caa-11e9-852a-fbec2baebb55.png)\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS> Measure-Command { 1..1e5 | % { 1+1 } > $null }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 254\r\nTicks             : 2545267\r\nTotalDays         : 2.94591087962963E-06\r\nTotalHours        : 7.07018611111111E-05\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.00424211166666667\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.2545267\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 254.5267\r\n```\r\n\r\n### BUT ...\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS> Measure-Command { 1..1e5 | & { process { 1+1 } } > $null }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 42\r\nTicks             : 426360\r\nTotalDays         : 4.93472222222222E-07\r\nTotalHours        : 1.18433333333333E-05\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.0007106\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.042636\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 42.636\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Foreach-Object` is still 4 - 6 times slower than a filter function. This is mainly because:\r\n1. `Foreach-Object` requires parameter binding for pipeline input while a filter function like the above one doesn't.\r\n2. `Foreach-Object` calls into `ScriptBlock.InvokeUsingCmdlet` over and over again for every pipeline input. `InvokeUsingCmdlet` needs to do necessary setups/cleanup before/after invoking the script block and `Foreach-Object` has to pay that tax over and over again. While for a filter, the setup and cleanup is done only once because the invocation stays in the same function.\r\n3. `Foreach-Object` runs the script block in the current scope so the compilation of the script block is un-optimized. While for a filter function, it runs in its own local scope and optimization is turned on.\r\n\r\n### Next Step\r\n\r\nInvestigate to avoid unnecessary parameter binding for pipeline objects by using binders.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",

[See this stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/958123/powershell-script-to-check-an-application-thats-locking-a-file) \r\n\r\n## What do people do now?\r\n\r\n[Microsoft distributes `handle.exe`, a `cmd` based tool from Systernals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle). Various community hacks also exist. Unix users scrape output from `fuser`.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nNothing specific, just to be able to target a file or directory and have a bunch of process objects as output like `get-process`.\r\n\r\nIt would also be good to update [Microsoft's handle page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/handle) to point to a PS release that includes the functionality.",

Adding parentheses around the `Get-Content` call to force it to run to completion and collect output before proceeding does work but is a bit clunky, and there's no reason that this shouldn't also work:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Content $Path -Raw | ForEach-Object { $_ -f $a } | Set-Content $Path\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently this doesn't, because the file handle is still not released until the pipeline's completion, despite all the data being read at once. There are other caveats to using `-Raw`, but this would at least enable simple operations with less clunky syntax.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nSomething that will help alleviate the issue a little bit is some of the changes to command disposal behaviour in #9900, which causes commands to be disposed as soon as their role in the pipeline is fully completed (after `EndProcessing` / `end{}` is completed).\r\n\r\nBeyond that, the rest of the changes can be implemented in Get-Content itself for -Raw, and it may be worth looking into whether there are other avenues for alleviating the issue.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Set-Content we can have a fallback behaviour whereby if it can't get a write handle on the file, it instead writes to a temporary file, and during EndProcessing() or with a Dispose() step it then copies the file over the original.",

This means potentially destroying works-in-progress if they're still untracked files.\r\n\r\nBy instead using `-fdX` we can get rid of any files that are actually being actively ignored (which are pretty much mainly the build files we _want_ to be removing, unless there's something I'm missing) _without_ also removing regular untracked files that aren't being .gitignore'd.\r\n\r\nFixes #10021 \r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nSee #10021\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",

Invoke `Start-PSBuild -Clean` to kick off a clean build process.\r\n1. Your untracked files are deleted without warning or prompt, and they don't even go into your recycle bin.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`Start-PSBuild -Clean` should not delete untracked source files without prompt by default (which `git clean` does). That is a really poor decision. I just lost a good chunk of work because of that behaviour, and now I'm losing time trying to get it back. All I wanted was a clean build (i.e. remove any temporary build files, and then rebuild). I did _not_ want to remove files I happen to have in my file system that may be important to me.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAny untracked files you have are removed without warning and without even going to the recycle bin.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nIrrelevant, but I happen to be invoking `Start-PSBuild` in Windows PowerShell 5.1.\r\n",

In that case, `WildcardPattern.IsMatch` essentially should just do a string comparison, but we are go through the same code path that handles real wildcard patterns, while results in unnecessary cycles and allocations.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a fast path for `WildcardPattern.IsMatch(string)` for that case -- simply do a string comparison when the pattern string contains no special characters (wildcard characters `*`, `?`, `[`, `]` and the escape character backtick `).\r\n\r\nThe following is the the memory allocation when the module analysis is triggered.\r\nAs is shown, `int32[]` allocation drops drastically, and also the type `PatternPositionVisitor` is completely avoided.\r\nThis is because the pattern matching happens in module analysis (e.g. `ModuleIntrinsics.ExportModuleMembers`) are now going through the fast path.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/60305002-ffef7680-98ef-11e9-8b47-f33f8766202e.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, `WildcardPattern.IsMatch` is about 2x faster in steady state when the pattern string contains no wildcard characters:\r\n\r\n#### Before the change\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS:1> $p = [WildcardPattern]::new(\"abcdefghi\")\r\nPS:18> Measure-Command { foreach ($i in 1..100000) { $p.IsMatch(\"abc\") } }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 103\r\nTicks             : 1030111\r\nTotalDays         : 1.19225810185185E-06\r\nTotalHours        : 2.86141944444444E-05\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.00171685166666667\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.1030111\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 103.0111\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### After the change\r\n```\r\nPS:1> $p = [WildcardPattern]::new(\"abcdefghi\")\r\nPS:31> Measure-Command { foreach ($i in 1..100000) { $p.IsMatch(\"abc\") } }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 59\r\nTicks             : 594633\r\nTotalDays         : 6.88232638888889E-07\r\nTotalHours        : 1.65175833333333E-05\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.000991055\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.0594633\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 59.4633\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",

The full library, for applications that host PowerShell (`Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK`)\r\n2. The reference library, for PowerShell modules (`PowerShellStandard.Library`)\r\n\r\nHowever, the reference library is currently bound to PS Standard, which means (as far as I can tell) it's essentially pinned at v5.1, and such a cmdlet or module isn't going to be able to access anything new in the PowerShell API from 6.x onwards into 7.0 and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis means that cmdlet authors either are forced to accept that they must stick with 5.1-level APIs regardless of anything new that comes out, or they must download the entire SDK and all its dependent packages (as though they were hosting PowerShell in a separate application) just to write a basic cmdlet.\r\n\r\nCan we please get a reference library release at least for V7 release, and possibly keep one up to date with the current PS release versions? 😊 ",

Reusing the same 2-dimensional integer array for processing line comments in the same `Tokenizer`.\r\n2. Use `ArrayPool<int>` in `PatternPositionVisitor` to avoid creating transient `int[]`.\r\n\r\nThese two changes reduces the allocation of `int[]` and `int[,]` significantly in the command discovery scenario where module analysis is required.

    "body": "Similar to #9881, while attempting to tab complete a variable reference, at least curly quotes (I've also determined en-dash/em-dash too) do not cause an escape to the `${ }` notation.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n${test`u{2018}var} = 'Hello World'\r\n\r\n$t # press tab for completion until `test‘var` appears\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n${test‘var}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$test‘var\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe this is part of the issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/981c990d747ae97f56a6c7474e5d2ef04bf237c5/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandCompletion/CompletionCompleters.cs#L4565-L4566\r\n\r\n\r\nI think this is inadequate to catch the conditions that require when the `${ }` notation is needed, but the above constant appears to be used for more than just that.  The list of characters that require the `${ }` notation is much larger and more complicated.  If regex could be used, the following might be more accurate for when to require the `${ }` : `^(?:[^$^\\w?:]|[$^?].)|.(?:::|[^\\w?:])` This would return a MATCH when `${ }` is required.  Examples:\r\n\r\n`$`  false\r\n`$$` true\r\n`^` false\r\n`^^` true\r\n`?` false\r\n`??` true\r\n`_?` false\r\n`::` false\r\n`a::` true\r\n`test‘var` true\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nThis particular example was captured with 6.2.0 on Win 10 Pro 18922 (Insiders)\r\n\r\n__Edit: improved performance of the regex example.__\r\n",
