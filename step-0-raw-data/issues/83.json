    "body": "When a variable with a script block is passed to a background job via `using`, the variable inside the job is a string instead of a script block.\r\n\r\nAs @bpayette [indicated below](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9703#issuecomment-495774758), this was by design to reduce the risk of accidentally executing code; however, this clearly seems like a design flaw now that we have the `&` background operator in PowerShell, and while it can be worked around, any code that works around it should be unnecessary. It is worth mentioning that the workaround demonstrated below would continue to work even if this bug was fixed because objects of type `scriptblock` convert implicitly to string, so the likelihood of this causing an issue for folks if it was fixed should be very low.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-Pester -ScriptBlock {\r\n    Describe 'Tests for using variables of specific types' -Tags 'CI' {\r\n        It 'Implicit using with background job operator and variable of type ScriptBlock' {\r\n            $sb = {Get-Process -Id $pid}\r\n            $job = & $sb &\r\n            $results = $job | Receive-Job -Wait\r\n            $results | Should -BeOfType PSObject\r\n            $results.PSTypeNames | Should -Contain Deserialized.System.Diagnostics.Process\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nTests Passed: 1, Failed: 0, Skipped: 0, Pending: 0, Inconclusive: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nTests Passed: 0, Failed: 1, Skipped: 0, Pending: 0, Inconclusive: 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nInvoke-Pester -ScriptBlock {\r\n    Describe 'Tests for using variables of specific types' -Tags 'CI' {\r\n        It 'Implicit using with background job operator and variable of type ScriptBlock' {\r\n            $sb = {Get-Process -Id $pid}\r\n            $job = & ([scriptblock]::Create($sb)) &\r\n            $results = $job | Receive-Job -Wait\r\n            $results | Should -BeOfType PSObject\r\n            $results.PSTypeNames | Should -Contain Deserialized.System.Diagnostics.Process\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0â€¦}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

However up until now HomeBrew only has one cask, for the latest version, which does \"feel\" right and I know there are other open issue about preview releases, which is a different matter.\r\n\r\nMy query is this: with 6.1 and 6.2 supported and 7.0 coming soon, should we continue with one cask, for the latest version, or should we have a cask for every version that has not gone past its end-of-life date?\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThe proposal would be to have multiple casks, which I am happy to help with as I have updated the main one a couple of times. I am not sure how the naming would work for non-latest releases. Clearly I am happy to help be part of the solution to this but thought it right to raise a request so others can comment.",

I'm using [Sentiment Analysis sample](https://github.com/dotnet/samples/tree/master/machine-learning/tutorials/SentimentAnalysis) for testing. Sample code runs just fine as a C# console app, but throws errors if executed as Powershell Cmdlet. It doesn't matter if it's binary cmdlet  ( using same exact code as console app) or pure PS. It doesn't work even if I save sample as a class library (and calling static methods from PS).\r\n\r\n- **Shuffle input cursor reader failed with an exception**\r\nIf disabling shuffling, getting this:\r\n- **Splitter/consolidator worker encountered exception while consuming source data**\r\n\r\nThis happens when calling fit method after trainer is added to the pipeline (I can call fit on estimator with no error). I tried Log regression and Fast Tree trainers (getting same errors)\r\n\r\nNot sure if there is any fundamental blocker, but I think it would be extremely useful to get it work with PowerShell.

Everything must use these now.\n>   - added single argument syntax for `gulp.task` which allows a named function to be used as the name of the task and task function.\n>   - added `gulp.tree` method for retrieving the task tree. Pass `{ deep: true }` for an `archy` compatible node list.\n>   - added `gulp.registry` for setting custom registries.\n> \n> ### CLI changes\n> \n> - split CLI out into a module if you want to save bandwidth/disk space. you can install the gulp CLI using either `npm install gulp -g` or `npm install gulp-cli -g`, where gulp-cli is the smaller one (no module code included)\n> - add `--tasks-json` flag to CLI to dump the whole tree out for other tools to consume\n> - added `--verify` flag to check the dependencies in package.json against the plugin blacklist.\n> \n> ### vinyl/vinyl-fs changes\n> \n> - added `gulp.symlink` which functions exactly like `gulp.dest`, but symlinks instead.\n> - added `dirMode` param to `gulp.dest` and `gulp.symlink` which allows better control over the mode of the destination folder that is created.\n> - globs passed to `gulp.src` will be evaluated in order, which means this is possible `gulp.src(['*.js', '!b*.js', 'bad.js'])` (exclude every JS file that starts with a b except bad.js)\n> - performance for gulp.src has improved massively\n>   - `gulp.src(['**/*', '!b.js'])` will no longer eat CPU since negations happen during walking now\n> - added `since` option to `gulp.src` which lets you only match files that have been modified since a certain date (for incremental builds)\n> - fixed `gulp.src` not following symlinks\n> - added `overwrite` option to `gulp.dest` which allows you to enable or disable overwriting of existing files\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n\n- [`069350a`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/069350a5febf65adc27bc816a7805471b7d96f03) Release: 4.0.2\n- [`b4b5a68`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/b4b5a68373b4c58d6b92321cea64a6ffcc3ff042) Build: Add node 12 to Travis & Azure\n- [`5667666`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/5667666ffae15c169f99c7096ca59c05f9440272) Fix: Bind src/dest/symlink to the gulp instance to support esm exports (ref s...\n- [`4091bd3`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/4091bd3aff08801625c6128eec079af4a7b5dccb) Docs: Add notes about esm support (closes [#2278](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2278))\n- [`3c66d95`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/3c66d95f014b99f79e0375c43cfa17a7269732a2) Docs: Fix the Negative Globs section & examples (closes [#2297](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2297))\n- [`1693a11`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/1693a1127116a6804a892a4b931c232b1bec9162) Docs: Remove next tag from recipes (closes [#2277](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2277))\n- [`d916276`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/d9162761f276fce5fe54bc0a60c7eb9efcd5e249) Docs: Add default task wrappers to Watching Files examples to make runnable (...\n- [`ea52a92`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/ea52a927843ff0e84f142f85813572bd5144a656) Docs: Fix syntax error in lastRun API docs (closes [#2315](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2315))\n- [`5d81f42`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/5d81f42f9ddc4aa0a0721057eff8b8e24b65861c) Docs: Fix typo in Explaining Globs ([#2326](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2326))\n- [`ea3bba4`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/ea3bba4fdf9f2b508699f69569d0191b8c5bc10c) Release: 4.0.1\n- Additional commits viewable in [compare view](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/compare/v3.9.1...v4.0.2)\n</details>\n<br />\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=gulp&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=3.9.1&new-version=4.0.2)](https://dependabot.com/compatibility-score.html?dependency-name=gulp&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=3.9.1&new-version=4.0.2)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.

    "body": "# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2019-0733 - Windows Defender Application Control Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## Executive Summary\r\n\r\nA security feature bypass vulnerability exists in Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) which could allow an attacker to bypass WDAC enforcement. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could circumvent Windows PowerShell Constrained Language Mode on the machine.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first have access to the local machine where PowerShell is running in Constrained Language mode. By doing that an attacker could leverage script debugging to abuse signed modules in an unintended way.\r\n\r\nThe update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how PowerShell functions in Constrained Language Mode.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update PowerShell Core to an unaffected version (see [affected software](#user-content-affected-software).)\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\">Affected Software</a>\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects PowerShell Core prior to the following versions:\r\n\r\n| PowerShell Core Version | Fixed in          |\r\n|-------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| 6.1                     | 6.1.4             |\r\n| 6.2                     | 6.2.1             |\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in [Affected Software](#user-content-affected-software) to see if your version of PowerShell Core is affected.\r\n1. If you are running a version of PowerShell Core where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Installing PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\r\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\r\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\r\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\r\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\r\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\r\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nMatt Graeber of [SpecterOps](https://specterops.io/)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\r\n\r\nSee [acknowledgments](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/acknowledgments) for more information.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2019-0733](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0733)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (May 21, 2019): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n*Version 1.0*\r\n*Last Updated 2019-05-21*\r\n",

This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Installing PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\r\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\r\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\r\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\r\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\r\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\r\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\r\n\r\nSee [acknowledgments](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/acknowledgments) for more information.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2019-0820](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0820)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (May 21, 2019): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n*Version 1.0*\r\n*Last Updated 2019-05-21*\r\n",

It may not necessarily be required in basic automation, but when writing highly resilient/portable tooling it becomes significantly more desirable.\r\n\r\nThere are two main scenarios I have in mind as motivation:\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring a parameter variable is populated by parameter binding (and not by a previous scope) with `$PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey`.\r\n    ```powershell\r\n        function Test-Parameter {\r\n        [CmdletBinding()]\r\n        param(\r\n            [Parameter()]\r\n            [string] $FileName\r\n        )\r\n        end {\r\n            if ($null -ne $FileName) {\r\n                # This may be true, but doesn't necessarily mean the parameter was passed.\r\n                'FileName isn''t null!'\r\n            }\r\n\r\n\r\n            # Currently you need to write:\r\n            # if ($PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey('FileName')) {\r\n            if ($PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey(nameof($FileName))) {\r\n                'FileName was actually specified!'\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Test-Parameter -FileName 'test'\r\n\r\n    # returns\r\n    # FileName isn't null!\r\n    # FileName was actually specified!\r\n\r\n    $FileName = 'something else'\r\n    Test-Parameter\r\n\r\n    # returns\r\n    # FileName isn't null!\r\n    ```\r\n1. Argument related error reporting, especially in classes.\r\n    ```powershell\r\n    class Utils {\r\n        static [void] DeleteFile([string] $fileName) {\r\n            if ([string]::IsNullOrEmpty($fileName)) {\r\n                # Current you need to write:\r\n                # throw [ArgumentNullException]::new('fileName')\r\n                throw [ArgumentNullException]::new(nameof($fileName))\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nGranted there is a lack of symbol rename support in most editors (including PSES) but that won't be the case forever, and it's still typically easier to notice a variable name vs the contents of a string.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n## Syntax\r\n\r\n```antlr\r\nnameof_expression\r\n    : 'nameof' body\r\n    ;\r\n\r\nbody\r\n    : start_tag target end_tag\r\n    ;\r\n\r\nstart_tag\r\n    : '{'\r\n    | '('\r\n    ;\r\n\r\nend_tag\r\n    : '}'\r\n    | ')'\r\n    ;\r\n\r\ntarget\r\n    : variable_expression_ast\r\n    | member_expression_ast\r\n    | type_expression_ast\r\n    | command_ast\r\n    ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest allowing `{}` as an enclosure because the only way to get similar functionality today is to write a function like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction nameof {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param(\r\n        [Parameter(Position=0, Mandatory)]\r\n        [ValidateNotNull()]\r\n        [ScriptBlock] $Expression\r\n    )\r\n    end {\r\n        $firstElement = $Expression.Ast.EndBlock.Statements[0].PipelineElements[0]\r\n        if ($firstElement.Expression.VariablePath.UserPath) {\r\n            return $firstElement.Expression.VariablePath.UserPath\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if ($firstElement.Expression.Member) {\r\n            return $firstElement.Expression.Member.SafeGetValue()\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if ($firstElement.GetCommandName) {\r\n            return $firstElement.GetCommandName()\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        if ($firstElement.Expression.TypeName.FullName) {\r\n            return $firstElement.Expression.TypeName.FullName\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAllowing `{}` would keep compatibility with code using that pattern today (assuming anyone else does that)\r\n\r\n## AST\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class NameOfExpressionAst : ExpressionAst\r\n{\r\n    public CommandBaseAst Target { get; }\r\n\r\n    public NameOfExpressionAst(IScriptExtent extent, CommandBaseAst target);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTyping the `Target` as a `CommandBaseAst` conveys that the contents should be a single command or expression.\r\n\r\nSemantic checks should be used to assert:\r\n\r\n1. A `CommandAst` has only one element, which is a bare word `StringConstantExpressionAst`\r\n1. A `CommandExpressionAst` has an expression of type `MemberExpressionAst`, `VariableExpressionAst`, or `TypeExpressionAst`\r\n1. If the underlying target is a `MemberExpressionAst`, the `Member` property is a `StringConstantExpressionAst`\r\n\r\nI picked the base `ExpressionAst` because it would be ideal if the keyword could be parsed in all parsing modes (except command argument mode)\r\n\r\n## Implementation\r\n\r\nThe `Compiler` could emit a string `ConstantExpression` based on `Target` when visiting `NameOfExpressionAst`.\r\n\r\n|Type|Value Path|\r\n|---|---|\r\n|CommandAst|target.GetCommandName()|\r\n|MemberExpressionAst|((StringConstantExpressionAst)target.Member).Value|\r\n|VariableExpressionAst|target.VariablePath.UserPath|\r\n|TypeExpressionAst|target.TypeName.FullName|\r\n\r\n## Impact\r\n\r\nThis would technically be a breaking change, but impact could be minimized by requiring no whitespace between the `nameof` keyword and the opening tag.",

That's tremendously valuable, thank you for adding that, I really appreciate it.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think you should reconsider PoshChan's interaction with conversations on the PR. The automated build process already shows its results in a PR, and while manually pulling the details of a failed build step is tedious/annoying, pulling those details out and adding them directly to the PR conversation is too noisy and takes value away from a PR conversation, especially when there are multiple builds (Windows, macos, linux) and when certain tests fail on each of those builds, resulting in the same information being posted three times.\r\n\r\nHow about updating PoshChan to gather the data for build step failures and posting a single message to the conversation that:\r\n1. Tags the PR author; and\r\n1. Includes a **link** to the specific issues (which would be stored elsewhere -- a randomly named text file in the cloud, or something similar) so that the PR author can review and correct the issues while still having useful, less noisy conversation in the PR itself.\r\n\r\nEither that or have PoshChan hide/remove old messages from a PR conversation when a new build starts so that only the latest are immediately visible, and on successful build hide/remove any previous messages.",

    "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nContinuing the work that was started in PR #8938, this PR adds more implicit line continuance support to simplify scripting while further reducing the need for explicit line continuance using backtick. With these changes in place, users can span commands across multiple lines as long as the subsequent lines begin with named parameters or splatted collections.\r\n\r\n## Breaking Change Details\r\n\r\nIt is marked as experimental at the moment because it introduces a breaking change and there wasn't a better way to make it optional at this time. Before these changes, users could invoke a command whose name begins with a dash (`-`), or a named unary operator in a statement, even on a line immediately following another command.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is what can be done before these changes:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfunction -minus {\r\n   'The -minus command was invoked.'\r\n}\r\nGet-Process -Id $PID\r\n-minus # Invokes the -minus command\r\n\r\nGet-Process -Id $PID\r\n-split 'a b c d'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this PR in place, and with the experimental feature enabled, here is what happens instead:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfunction -minus {\r\n   'The -minus command was invoked.'\r\n}\r\nGet-Process -Id $PID\r\n-minus # Identifies the '-minus' text as a named parameter for Get-Process (implicit line continuance)\r\n& -minus # Invokes the -minus command using the required workaround\r\n\r\n-minus # The workaround isn't necessary when you don't have a command on the contiguous, non-whitespace lines before this command\r\n\r\nGet-Process -Id $PID\r\n-split 'a b c d' # Identifies the '-split' text as a named parameter for Get-Process (implicit line continuance)\r\n\r\n-split 'a b c d' # You can invoke named unary operators after commands by ensuring the parser recognizes them as new statements (which is done by placing a blank line before them)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile command names beginning with dash are virtually non-existent, to the point where I don't know if any exist in Windows or Linux (searches seem to indicate that dashes as the first character are problematic when it comes to file names on Linux, so maybe that's why), named unary operators are part of PowerShell and are used frequently. With that in mind, I've opened an [RFC for discussion](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/176) on possibilities because I believe this feature adds significant value that is worth considering, even if it remains only optional.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThis PR helps because PowerShell has many long commands (especially since some command names are over 60 characters long!), with many, many parameters, and users often want to span those commands across multiple lines in their scripts, but the only way to do that in PS 6.x and earlier is to use backtick or splatting. Neither of those should be necessary. Splatting has a purpose (passing in a common set of parameters to multiple commands), but splatting should not be the solution to more intelligent line wrapping within scripts. Instead, PowerShell can simply identify implicit line continuance automatically by looking at the subsequent lines to determine if they start with a named parameter or a splatted collection, and if so, tread them as part of the same command.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed: [#4303](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4303)\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Experimental**\r\n    - [X] The use of and testing of this feature requires enabling the following experimental features: `PSImplicitLineContinuanceForNamedParameters`\r\n",

    "body": "Hello.  I have been automating tasks involving Azure DevOps' NuGet Feed with PowerShell Core on Windows 10 and have found a very odd inconsistency.  In short, if I try to register the NuGet Feed as a PS Repository through PS Core, I receive a warning and any subsequent attempts to access the PS Repo fail (before and after a console restart). The **weird part** is that if I use the same code in PowerShell to register the PS Repo and then open a new PS Core console, the follow-up commands work as expected.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n1. **May or May Not Matter** - Follow the steps from [Use Azure Artifacts as a private PowerShell repository](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/artifacts/tutorials/private-powershell-library?view=azure-devops&viewFallbackFrom=vsts) until \"Connecting to the feed as a PowerShell repo\".\r\n2.

(Unfortunately, BMP does not support transparency.)\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nIn order to be fully accessible, we need to support the High Contrast Black theme in Windows. This makes system-wide text white which is unreadable on the BMP's hardcoded white background. \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",
