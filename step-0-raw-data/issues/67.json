    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSummarize #3232 to get working _in the same way on all platforms_:\r\n\r\n`sudo Remove-Item foo.txt` where foo.txt is owned by root\r\n\r\n[See also](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3232#issuecomment-565936036)\r\n\r\nWe have two common scenario for sudo - run a native command and run a script.\r\n\r\n1. Run a native command\r\nThis can be easily implemented like:\r\n```powersherll\r\nStart-Process <nativecommand> -ArgumentList … -Credential $userCred -Wait\r\n```\r\nSide effect on Windows: new window will be opened because:\r\n- Windows does not allow elevate current process\r\n- Windows does not allow attach elevated process to current console\r\n [.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo.createnowindow?view=netframework-4.8#remarks) (and I guess Windows API too) doesn't allow to run new process attached to the same console.\r\nSo we can not get elevated `Start-Process pwsh -NoNewWindow -Credential $cred`\r\n\r\n2. Run a script\r\n2.1. We could implement this as for native command:\r\n```powersherll\r\nStart-Process pwsh -ArgumentList \"-c\",\"<scriptblockstring>\" -Credential $userCred -Wait\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.2. We could implement this in most power way using PowerShell remoting:\r\n```powersherll\r\nInvoke-Command -ComputerName LocalHost -ScriptBlock <scriptblock> -Credential $userCred -ArgumentList ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Current implementation proposal is 2.2.\r\nAlternative proposal - [start another pwsh process](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3232#issuecomment-500506716)\r\n\r\n#### Proposed name\r\n\r\n- __pssudo__ to avoid a conflict with Unix native sudo.\r\n- Invoke-AsUser\r\n\r\n#### Proposed UX behavior\r\n\r\n- interactively ask for credentials at first run\r\n- store credentials for a time and doesn't ask in follow runs\r\n\r\nIt is still not clear:\r\n- PowerShell remoting to localhost by default has disabled elevated accounts in WinRM loopback - how could we address this in the context sudo? Even if PowerShell remoting does not allow us to do sudo by default, we could implement it turned off by default or allow only for an interactive session.\r\n- PS sudo implementation should works over any transport - WinRM and SSH. But again there is a question about elevation in loopback -  regardless of a protocol, security should remain at the same level, which implies that SSH loopback should behave the same as for WinRM taking in account how Windows internals work but currently SSH loopback works (with manual connection).",

Therefore binding pipeline objects to a new `-InputObject` parameter whose (distinct set of ) types are to be looked up should work.\r\n\r\n  * Being able to do something like `'foo'.Split | Get-Help` would be great, but, unfortunately, the resulting `PSMethodInfo` instances contain no information about the enclosing _type_.\r\n\r\n* The lookup URL should include a `?view=netcore-<major>.<minor>` / `?view=netframework-<major>.<minor>` query string reflecting the .NET platform underlying the executing PowerShell engine.\r\n\r\n* For an implementation of this functionality as PowerShell function `Show-TypeHelp` (focused on .NET type lookup only), see [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59324892/45375).\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "AWS PowerShell Lambda uses the `ResetRunspaceState()` API as part of a performance optimization  when running PowerShell scripts on Lambda. The use of this API causes `$?` to become useless in a runspace after `ResetRunspaceState()` is called. \r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\n$iss = [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.InitialSessionState]::CreateDefault()\r\n$rs = [RunspaceFactory]::CreateRunspace($iss);\r\n$rs.Open();\r\n\r\n# Now reset the runspace state\r\n#$rs.ResetRunspaceState();\r\n\r\n$ps = [powershell]::Create($rs).AddScript(@'\r\n        Get-Date\r\n        [console]::WriteLine(\"After Get-Date; hook is $?\")\r\n\r\n        Get-Content NoSuchFile\r\n        [console]::WriteLine(\"After Get-Content; hook is $?\")\r\n\r\n        # Customer's xample\r\n        try { NoSuchCommand } catch {}\r\n        [console]::WriteLine(\"After try/catch; hook is $?\")\r\n'@)\r\n\r\n$ps.Invoke()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe `$?` variable should accurately reflect that execution status of the last command like this:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nAfter Get-Date; hook is True\r\nAfter Get-Content; hook is False\r\nAfter try/catch; hook is False\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens is that, regardless of the execution status of the last command, `$?` is always true.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nAfter Get-Date; hook is True\r\nAfter Get-Content; hook is True\r\nAfter try/catch; hook is True\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like all that's required to fix this is to remove the line of code in `ResetRunspaceState()` that's overwriting the `$?` variable, especially given that there's no real reason to be doing this in the first place. Note: this issue doesn't affect the chaining operators that @rjmholt added so that code must be using the underlying data element. \r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\nNote: This bug appears to repro on all versions of PowerShell.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.6-18-g2a76aa10ee804f47ad2499915d206e1dd470898d\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

I tried to use Move-Item and then Rename-Item to fix the name of the file but was unable to due so. As can be see in the log even Get-ChildItem struggled with displaying the file appropriately. gci mistakenly thought the file was in a subfolder. Using mv from bash I was able to fix the file name. I would never intentionally create a file with such a name but It should still be possible to fix the name when it does happen.\r\n```powershell\r\nengineer@se206:~/Downloads/5603/windows/factory/bu$ pwsh-preview \r\nPowerShell 7.0.0-preview.6\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nOne of the things that I miss in PowerShell from my years of using *nix shells, is the ability to combine multiple parameters into a single one.\r\nThe easiest way to see this behavior is with `/bin/rm` where `/bin/rm -r -f *` is equivalent to `/bin/rm -rf *`.\r\nWhile PowerShell has a way to create parameter aliases, it's a _developer_ activity, rather than a user activity,\r\nwhich puts the responsibility on the developer to create a custom experience for the user.\r\nWe've done a pretty good job with parameter aliases, but I feel we still fall short.\r\nI think this can be enhanced and improve the experience by providing what I like to call _Composed Parameters_.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nHere's what happens today:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> remove-item -rf *\r\nRemove-Item: A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'rf'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this new behavior can be added to `Set-Alias` to include not just command aliases, but parameter aliases as well.\r\nA new parameter set could be created for `Set-Alias` which provides the following behavior:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> Set-Alias -parameter rf -command remove-item -value @{ Force = $true; Recurse = $true }\r\nPS> remove-item -rf *\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe aliased parameter would be _preferred_, so the parameter binder would check the aliases _first_ and replace the aliased parameter with the provided values.\r\nThis implies that you could create a parameter alias as:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> Set-Alias -parameter f -command * -value { Force = $true }\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich would prefer `-force` over `-filter` for commands like `get-childitem`, which might improve the experience further.\r\n\r\nNote that this does _not_ address issues of ordering (`rm -rf` vs `rm -fr`), but much of these behaviors are muscular rather than cognitive; Fingers typing the same thing over and over, year after year, rather than thinking about it.\r\n\r\nNote that this implies that not only the `alias` cmdlets would need change, but also we would need a way to store this information in the alias provider, but I don't believe this to be overly complicated.\r\n\r\nA couple of further thoughts:\r\n\r\n* What about multiple instances of parameters?\r\n  * I think that we do simple replacements, which means that we would get a runtime error if we saw:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> Set-Alias -parameter rf -command remove-item -value @{ Force = $true; Recurse = $true }\r\nPS> Remove-Item -rf -force *\r\nRemove-Item: Cannot bind parameter because parameter 'force' is specified more than once. To provide multiple values to parameters that can accept multiple values, use the array syntax. For example, \"-parameter value1,value2,value3\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n* ScriptAnalyzer rules should be created to warn when this is done\r\n  * I see this as an interactive behavior which should probably not be in scripts\r\n",

Given the risk of these last minute changes, we don't want to promote this to stable in 7.0.\r\n* `PSDesiredStateConfiguration.InvokeDscResource`: this has some limitations compared to the `Invoke-DscResource` shipped in Windows PS that we'd like to address before graduating it.",

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nToday, it's hard to manipulate PowerShell PSD1/hashtable syntax. `Import-PowerShellDataFile` provides some options, but it only goes one way, requires a file, and doesn't work with all files ending in psd1 (module manifests allowing \"Restricted Language Mode\", so having things that ordinary data syntax does not allow).\r\n\r\nTo make the PowerShell data syntax a first class citizen within PowerShell, I think we would need:\r\n\r\n- `ConvertTo-` and `ConvertFrom-` cmdlets\r\n- Efficient and consistent [de]serialisation for hashtables, pscustomobjects and arbitrary objects in the usual way\r\n- Support for the extended restricted language mode syntaxes enabled by switches\r\n- An API available to do this without a cmdlet. One place this would help is with the `ModuleSpecification` `ToString()` implementation, which today [hand writes psd1 hashtable format](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bcc565603cee552b10244be82a2797da2ff38cab/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/ModuleSpecification.cs#L185-L227).\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI have a small prototype [here](https://gist.github.com/rjmholt/dfb403556753f17fedd3075edd91459f), but I propose the following:\r\n\r\n- `ConvertTo-Psd` and `ConvertFrom-Psd` being the cmdlets\r\n- Following the standard JSON cmdlet conventions, with `Depth` and `Compress` or similar parameters\r\n- ~~Having a switch for enabling restricted language mode parsing (which will require the full PowerShell parser), perhaps `-WithFullParsing` or similar~~ Now that I understand this better, I don't think it fits well with this proposal; restricted language mode parsing is specific to module manifests and doesn't reflect broader usage of PSD format\r\n",

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently, when you use `Enter-PSSession` for a remote session, PowerShell prepends \"[_computername_]: \". If we have `$prompt` functions like powerline, that tends to mess up the vibe. Here's an example using my own `$prompt` that is similar to powerline:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1532486/70355630-7e4d2e80-1827-11ea-859a-820446fccefe.png)\r\n\r\nWhile a good default, it would be nice if we could have a preference variable to disable this and instead (or, perhaps, in addition to the default) have a variable that contains the remote host.\r\n\r\nThe [GetRemotePrompt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d58a82ad19fbfad81e85778c8b08cb1b28f58fce/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/hostifaces/HostUtilities.cs#L683) function does evaluate the `$prompt` function (though, by default, for remotes this isn't possible; see repro steps), but then prepends one of a few different prefixes regardless of a user's `$prompt`.\r\n\r\nI propose:\r\n\r\n1. Define a variable like `$PSRemoteComputerName` (or `$PSRemoteComputerName` - same suffix as the `Enter-PSSession -HostName` parameter) or add a property to something like `$ExecutionContext` (perhaps all remote runspace's `ConnectionInfo`) so scripts - like `$PROFILE` - can access it.\r\n2. Support a preference variable to disable prepending the remote host name.\r\n\r\n## Repro steps\r\n\r\nBy default, `$profile` scripts aren't even run with remote sessions (`$profile` isn't even available), so one does have to make it possible:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# enable remoting (if not enabled already)\r\nenable-psremoting -force\r\n\r\n# create a startup script to set and source $profile\r\n@'\r\n$global:PROFILE = Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'Documents\\PowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1'\r\nif (Test-Path $PROFILE -PathType 'Leaf') {\r\n    . $PROFILE\r\n}\r\n'@ > $pshome\\profile.ps1\r\n\r\n# register a new session configuration with that script\r\nregister-pssessionconfiguration -name WithProfile -startupscript $pshome\\profile.ps1\r\n\r\n# remote in with that new session configuration\r\nenter-pssession mycomputer -configurationname withprofile\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n[ConsoleHost](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a1c2d3c9777530030031e3404ac72dfd4f1b1b3e/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ConsoleHost.cs#L2786) is already evaluating the `$prompt` function, so in [GetRemotePrompt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d58a82ad19fbfad81e85778c8b08cb1b28f58fce/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/hostifaces/HostUtilities.cs#L683) we could evaluate a variable or other property and simply **not** prepend the string. In lieu or in addition to the prefix, we can set variables (constants) for both the username (if SSH) and computername that scripts can use in their `$prompt` or wherever.",

So if a user has PSModulePath defined in their User scope, then the Machine scope one isn't used.  In other words, the Process scope env var is the same as the User scope env var.  However, Windows treats PATH differently in that it concatenates PATH from User scope with PATH from Machine scope.  PSModulePath works like PATH so it should also do the same thing that Windows doesn't automatically do.  You can observe this with just cmd.exe.\r\n\r\nThe fix here is to start with env var inherited by Process.  If it's the same as the one in User scope, it means the user hasn't modified it and it's incomplete, so we append the Machine scope one.  If it's different, we just use the Process one.  \r\n\r\nAlso fixed an issue where PSModulePath was a single path without a path separator.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11172\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

When a PowerShell class is defined in a scope, a new `TypeResolutionState` will be created for the specific scope.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

The following function should approximate this, though:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction global:prompt {\r\n  \"`e[0;38;5;15;48;5;5mPS`e[38;5;5;48;5;8m`u{e0b0} `e[38;5;15m$PWD `e[0;38;5;8m`u{e0b0}`e[0m \"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Set the global prompt function as above.\r\n2. pushd into deep directories like so:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\npushd $env:TEMP\r\nmkdir (new-guid) | pushd\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, this approximate function had sporadic results compared with the screenshot below. Sometimes the expected behavior is what I saw, while others it was the actual behavior; however, when I got the expected behavior, resizing the window caused other problems as shown directly below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1532486/70224521-400a1f00-1702-11ea-9e7e-8d346e49a812.png)\r\n\r\nNotice how the beginning of the prompts shifts by increasingly deeper margins.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe line background color stops at the end of the text where it should (see cmd.exe example in screenshot below, which uses a similar vterm sequence as my `$prompt`).\r\n\r\nThis problem also does not occur in the integrated terminal for VSCode:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1532486/70222551-126fa680-16ff-11ea-97e8-d1deb46caff1.png)\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe line background color extends to the window width. If I resize the window - e.g. shrink by 1 character width then move back to original width - this extra background line is cleared showing what I would otherwise expect (like in the cmd.exe you see in the following screenshot):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1532486/70221580-7abd8880-16fd-11ea-9a5d-52766e39616c.png)\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362 \r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0ΓÇª}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFont: Cascadia Code PL",

If a module exposes a PSDrive that is used over PowerShell remoting, we generate proxy functions used locally that remote the calls.  We should have something similar for PSDrives (whether used via implicit remoting or enable `new-psdrive` to point to a remote machine).\r\n",

When used interactively, the console host does the calculation, so need to make a method that was only used on Windows available for all platforms and use it to calculate length in buffer cells.  When formatting goes through `Out-String`, then it uses the default length calculation in line output so that needed to use the same method.  Since the code is in two different assemblies, there is two copies of the same code.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11232\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
