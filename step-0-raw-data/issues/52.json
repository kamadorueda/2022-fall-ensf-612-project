Ideally your helper would use `pushd` (`Push-Location`), but it cannot, because `pushd` in a module will use a separate, module-scoped location stack. There is currently no way (that I know of) to access the user's global location stack from a module. (The only way to have such a helper currently is to have code in your $profile.)\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nI haven't put a ton of thought into this, but an easy way to do this would be to introduce a new parameter to `Push-Location`: `-GlobalStack`.\r\n",

Those objects might be accessed concurrently and PowerShell threw exceptions, see my issue comment for more details. I attached the debugger to `PowerShell`, I looked deeper and it seems the culprit is the `BindableParameters` property of `MergedCommandParameterMetadata`. Therfore the easy (but wrong) fix is to make it use a thread safe dictionary. I am aware that Jason @lzybkr previously said in a similar PR (but different area - the module system) that most of the PS engine deliberately doesn't use locking. In this case, this proposed change is probably not the right change (and probably break other things as indicated by the failing tests) because the class calls `.Clear()` and `.Add()` internally for internal resetting/updating in various scenarios. This PR is rather the starting point of a discussion at which layer we can/should intervene to prevent such errors. Would a slim read lock around `_bindableParameters` be a possible and acceptable solution?\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

    "body": "I was load testing some PowerShell code that uses a background runspace to ship all the errors that have been written to $Error. I ran into the 256 item limit. I struggled to figure out why the $MaximumErrorCount variable mentioned in several articles wasn't working until I tried going back to PowerShell 5.1. After realizing it was just broken after Powershell 5.1 I adjusted my web search and found this thread.\r\n\r\nPaul clearly calls out the issue of backward compatibility and avoiding an unnecessary limitation. Instead a decision was made based on a faulty argument that removing functionality isn't an issue of backward compatibility and also on not \"seeing folks using it\".\r\n\r\nRegarding this change being made three years ago, I would suggest that people aren't noticing until now because their migration to .Net-Core-Based PowerShell has been delayed potentially due to issues like this.\r\n\r\nPlease reinstate the ability to increase the MaximumErrorCount because people need it, it had already been implemented practically, and there cases when it is preferable to using -ErrorVariable or clearing the $Error variable as it fills up.\r\n\r\nSee previous thread:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/2363\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n$MaximumErrorCount = 10000\r\n\r\nfor ($item = 0; $item -lt 1000; $item++)\r\n{\r\n    1/0\r\n}\r\n\r\n$error.count\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput: 1000\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nOutput: 256\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "SYMPTOMS\r\nAfter successfully configuring OpenSSH as a server on Windows, confirming that access with ssh.exe or putty.exe works as expected, when connecting with pwsh's Enter-PSSession or Invoke-Command, it fails with an error message: \"There is an error processing data from the background process. Error reported: ...\" When you delete, rename or move your PowerShell profile script(s) at that OpenSSH server, the error message disappears and pwsh remoting works as expected.\r\n\r\nCAUSE\r\nYou have 1) a profile script at the OpenSSH server, 2) that profile script prints or displays output when run, and 3) you have changed the default OpenSSH server's command shell from CMD to either Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core. The output of the profile script is disrupting the launch of pwsh as an OpenSSH \"subsystem\" despite the fact that the sshd_config file is correctly configured with the \"..\\pwsh.exe -sshs -nologo -noprofile\" line.\r\n\r\nREPRODUCE\r\nInstall PowerShell Core 7 preview 5 on a Windows Server 2019 system.\r\n\r\nDelete, rename or move all PowerShell profile scripts on that server.\r\n\r\nInstall the OpenSSH 8.0.beta sshd.exe service from GitHub on that Windows Server into $env:ProgramFiles\\OpenSSH as recommended, and configure the \"Subsystem\" line in it's sshd_config file (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core?view=powershell-6).\r\n\r\nConfirm that the OpenSSH server is working with both ssh.exe and pwsh's \"Enter-PSSession -HostName server.\"\r\n\r\nChange the OpenSSH default command shell to either powershell.exe or pwsh.exe (https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/DefaultShell).\r\n\r\nConfirm with ssh.exe and \"Enter-PSSession -HostName server\" that OpenSSH is still accessible and that ssh.exe gets the new default shell as expected (powershell.exe or pwsh.exe, not CMD).\r\n\r\nAdd a profile script for powershell.exe or pwsh.exe, whichever one you want, and add a command to that script which produces output, e.g., a line like \"XXXXXXX\".\r\n\r\nConfirm with ssh.exe that OpenSSH is still accessible and that the profile script runs as expected, e.g., it prints \"XXXXXXX.\"\r\n\r\nAttempt to connect with pwsh's \"Enter-PSSession -HostName server\" as before. Note that it now fails with an error message: \"There is an error processing data from the background process. Error reported: XXXXXXX.\"\r\n\r\nComment out the line from the profile script which produces the output. Add other commands to the profile script which do not produce output, e.g., create a function. Attempt to connect again with pwsh's \"Enter-PSSession -HostName server\" and note that it succeeds.\r\n\r\nUncomment the line from the profile script which produces the output and causes pwsh's Enter-PSSession to fail.\r\n\r\nChange the default OpenSSH command shell back to CMD again.\r\n\r\nAttempt to connect again with pwsh's \"Enter-PSSession -HostName server\" and note that it succeeds.\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\nSet the default OpenSSH command shell back to CMD. Use Process Explorer or a similar tool to watch the sshd.exe service as a pwsh client connects with \"Enter-PSSession -HostName server\". The parent sshd.exe spawns a child sshd.exe, which runs \"cmd.exe /c\" to launch \"pwsh.exe -sshs -nologo -noprofile\". It works.\r\n\r\nBut when 1) the default OpenSSH shell is changed to either powershell.exe or pwsh.exe and 2) there is a profile script that produces output, then the parent sshd.exe runs either \"powershell.exe -c\" or \"pwsh.exe -c\" (whichever you chose) in order to launch \"pwsh.exe -sshs -nologo -noprofile\". The profile script of powershell.exe/pwsh.exe is disrupting the launch of the last pwsh.exe in the chain of process launches.\r\n\r\nThe \"-c\" argument to powershell.exe/pwsh.exe seems to be hard-coded into sshd.exe. Following the above instructions for changing the default OpenSSH command shell, if you configure the DefaultShellCommandOption registry value, this value appears to be ignored by sshd.exe when launching pwsh as a subsystem. (See https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/DefaultShell.) Setting the DefaultShellCommandOption value to something like \"-noprofile -command\" does not work.\r\n\r\nThis issue has not been tested on a Linux SSH server.\r\n\r\nThis issue has not been tested on any earlier versions of pwsh or OpenSSH for Windows.\r\n\r\nEXPECTED BEHAVIOR\r\nWhen the default OpenSSH command shell is changed from CMD to either powershell.exe or pwsh.exe on a Windows server, and the SSH user has a profile script on that server, then that profile script should not be run when the user connects with \"Enter-PSSession -HostName server\" using pwsh.\r\n\r\nMITIGATION\r\nEither 1) change the default OpenSSH command shell back to CMD on the target server, or 2) edit your profile script on the server so that it produces no output when it runs. The profile script can create functions, change the Prompt function, change colors, etc., just so long as it produces no output which confuses sshd.exe.\r\n\r\nNOTE: This is a re-creation of https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1498 created at the direction of @bagajjal and originally created by @JasonFossen.",

except 'Write-Output'.)\r\n\r\nI write cmdlets in my modules usually in a way, that they use 'Write-Error', when I consider something to be an error, thus giving the users the possibility to decide for themselves, if those errors should be terminating or not by calling them either with '-ErrorAction:Stop' or not so.\r\n\r\nMy cmdlets in my modules serve mainly for automated testing, so it is often desired, that a test fails, if an error occurs and thus many of those cmdlets are called with '-ErrorAction:Stop'.\r\nAnd for automated testing we used to use 'Colored HTML transcription', because for human testers it is very convenient to see colors in transcript files which got produced for test suites which run hundreds of tests over night to immediately see errors and warnings and hints.\r\nBut we had to stop to make use of this nice feature, because at some point I found out, that the very important feature of 'auto terminating' a single test with 'Failed' in case of an error didn't work under some circumstances, because of the bug, where -ErrorAction:Stop' just doesn't work.\r\n\r\nAs a side note:\r\nThe bug is easily reproducible on 7.0.1 as well as on 5.1.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOverwrite 'Write-Error' in a module the way it can be found in many examples on the Internet and I think also in the 'Windows PowerShell Cookbook' by 'O'Reilly' (steppablePipeline).\r\nThe overwrite just may use again the original 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\\Write-Error'.\r\nIn that same module write a simple cmdlet called like 'Test-WriteErrorInOverloadModule' which does nothing else then call 'Write-Error' with some message.\r\nThen in some other module write a simple cmdlet called like 'Test-WriteErrorInOtherModule' which also just calls 'Write-Error' with some message.\r\n\r\nIn the module where the 'Write-Error' overwrite is defined, also add a function which replaces the original 'Write-Error' cmdlet with the 'Overwrite'.\r\n\r\nNow call the function which does the 'Write-Error' replacement and then call:\r\n'Test-WriteErrorInOverloadModule -ErrorAction:Stop' within a try/catch\r\nand then call 'Test-WriteErrorInOtherModule -ErrorAction:Stop' withing a try/catch and see what happens!\r\nThe first one will go to the catch block, but the second one not!\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nAlso the call to 'Test-WriteErrorInOtherModule -ErrorAction:Stop' should go to the catch block.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nThe call to 'Test-WriteErrorInOtherModule -ErrorAction:Stop' doesn't make the error thrown within that function to be a terminating error as expected.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nI'm quite sure, that some guys here are aware of that problem, because when I tried to find a solution for it back then some months ago - I stumbled over dozens of Powershell 'Error-Handling' related issues and really very long discussions on this topic here on this Powershell GitHub where I also found indications, that this is a real problem that - depending from where called, the behavior might be different.\r\nIf you ask me - this is a severe issue, because if you cannot rely on something that important to work the same way independently of some preconditions, you really loose a lot of trust.\r\n\r\nSince this bug is not that easy to reproduce, I attached a zip file with 2 modules where everything already is prepared, so that you do not have to write those before-mentioned cmdlets yourself.\r\nJust call the script 'Check.ps1' (located in the 'WriteErrorOverloadModule' base directory) and see what happens.\r\n\r\nIf someone would know of a workaround to overcome this problem, I would very much appreciate if you could give me hints how to do so.\r\n\r\n[PoSh Example for Write-Error overload problem.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/4706586/PoSh.Example.for.Write-Error.overload.problem.zip)\r\n",

The original discussion in #12544 was regarding UNC paths, but I felt it was appropriate to address it as a whole, instead of only for the `FileSystem` provider.\r\n\r\nI've added tests for the prompt, but so far it only covers the codepath in `InitialSessionState.cs`, and I could probably use some pointers on getting coverage of the remaining codepaths.\r\n\r\nI'm also unsure if this is considered a breaking change, it is clearly something the user can change at will, and I don't think applications or scripts can reasonably depend on them, on the other hand it can change the display of third party modules like `sqlps`.\r\n\r\nI can't find documentation specifically describing paths like `PS Microsoft.Powershell.Core\\FileSystem::\\\\share\\path>` currently so I think no new documentation is required, except for release notes of course.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThis implements the enhancement requested in #12544\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.",

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nA simple cmdlet to create a hash table (indexed lookup) for an array objects with properties.  While simple to do in code, it is a pattern I often find myself repeating over and over again in code and could probably be further enhanced by being built-in.\r\n\r\nThe general idea here is I have large array of objects with properties many of which are unique.  For example, all uses from an Active Directory forest.  Now let's say I have some SQL database that provides a user's user principal name and I need to lookup some other property of the user.  So, the lazy mans way of doing this might be find the users by doing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nForEach ($Row in $Rows)\r\n{\r\n   $UserData = $AllUsers | Where-Object { $_.UserPrincipalName -eq $Row.User }\r\n   Write-Host $UserData.SamAccountName\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor these scenarios, I often find myself using a simple pattern of creating a hash-based index for reuse: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$UserHash = @{}\r\n$AllUsers | ForEach-Object { $UserHash[$_.UserPrincipalName] = $_ }\r\nForEach ($Row in $Rows)\r\n{\r\n   Write-Host $UserHash[$Row.User].SamAccountName\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis change can often result in 100x performance improvement for sufficiently large datasets.  \r\n\r\nIf somebody is already aware of a better way to do this using current cmdlets, please educate me accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nWhile it only takes two lines to implement this pattern, it would be more readable (and potentially higher performing) if we could avoid the need for a script block and wrap it into something more readable like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$UserHash = ConvertTo-HashTableLookup -InputObject $Array -Property 'HashKeyProperty'\r\n```\r\nGiven my perceived simplicity of this, I would be more than happy to work on it.\r\n",

Later we can more easily fix already known bugs/inconsistencies and add new features.\r\n\r\nPerformance win is up to 50%.\r\nAllocations are dramatically reduces if filtering is used (now no allocations are for discarded  paths).\r\n\r\n- Use new .Net Runtime path (folder/file) enumerator in PowerShell file system provider.\r\n- Refactor existing code to one method.\r\n- Add more tests (mainly for hidden file attribute)\r\n\r\nToday the .Net API does not support:\r\n- `Depth` ([tracking issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/43748)) and we use a workaround in the case.\r\n- ContinueOnError predicate and we use copy-pasted and bit enhanced code from .Net.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nCurrent implementation is a generic (common for all providers) enumerating code which is very expensive. New implementation uses new .Net API for file enumerating. The API is very fast and efficient, especially if filtering is used.\r\n\r\nThe follow intention is to use this approach later for `dir -recurse` too and then fix known bugs and add new features.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

    "body": "# Revisiting ParameterSets\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nThe current limitation to parametersets easily leads to an explosion of parametersets.\r\nLet's say a command has 4 different ways to connect to something, with 3 different identity resolution options to achieve its ways in one of 4 different ways:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n4 * 3 * 4 = 48\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat currently ends up as 48 different parametersets. Any additional parameter that is legal for most (but not all) 48 sets would require an equal number of separate parameter attributes! As [Kirk mentioned in a previous discussion on this](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/2#issuecomment-177718730), Invoke-Command is a default cmdlet with a great example of the curent complexity (though not quite as bad as the scenario drawn up above).\r\n\r\nIn total, I have three issues with the current system, that I'd like to address (and a proposed form for each of them):\r\n\r\n+ Limited utility of `DefaultParameterSetName` in complex parameterset situations.\r\n+ Parameter attribute duplication with exactly the same properties except `ParameterSetName`\r\n+ Combination of multiple sets of mutually exclusive parameters exploding total set number\r\n\r\nOn top of all that, we also need to work on the consuming user's experience in help and syntax display, as simplifying the experience for developers is likely to lead to an increased use, turning the current display form into utter futility if the total available complexity increases any further.\r\n\r\nSo here are my ideas on how the final form could be made to look. Feedback, counters and counter proposals more than welcome :)\r\n\r\n## 1) Improving the DefaultParameterSetName\r\n\r\nThe current system is limited by the fact that we can only have a single `DefaultParameterSetName` to help with parameterset resolution. An example parameter situation:\r\n\r\nThe command `Get-Something` has two primary parameters that are mutually exclusive. It also has two supplementary parameters which _may_ be used with either, but not together. Theoretically this results in 6 parameter sets:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Something -Main1\r\nGet-Something -Main1 -SubA\r\nGet-Something -Main1 -SubB\r\nGet-Something -Main2\r\nGet-Something -Main2 -SubA\r\nGet-Something -Main2 -SubB\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith the current system, this cannot be expressed at all: Assuming the first path becomes the `DefaultParameterSetName`, the fourth option will automatically lead to an ambiguous parameterset (as all the last three options could still be possible).\r\n\r\nThis could be solved by making the attribute accept a string-array in descending order of relevance:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSetName = 'Set1', 'Set2')]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t# Parameters go here\r\n\t)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith that, `Set1` would be the default parameterset. If that set is no longer possible, switch to `Set2` being the default set (and so on, if more are specified).\r\n\r\nIn conjunction with proposal 3), this could be extended to also support a hashtable instead, for different parameterset groups:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSetName = @{\r\n\t\tGroup1 = 'Set1'\r\n\t\tGroup2 = 'SetA'\r\n\t})]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t# Parameters go here\r\n\t)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 2) Reduce Parameter Attribute duplication\r\n\r\nA parameter that can be part of multiple (but not all) parametersets requires an individual parameter attribute for each possible set. This increases parameter block size, causes more effort and reduces overall readability. Example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding()]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t# Lots of other parameters\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'Set1')]\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'Set2')]\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'Set3')]\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'Set4')]\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'Set5')]\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'Set6')]\r\n\t\t[MyModule.Options]\r\n\t\t$Option\r\n\t)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI thus propose adding three new legal notations:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Proposal 1: Array\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding()]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t# Lots of other parameters\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'Set1', 'Set2', 'Set3', 'Set4', 'Set5', 'Set6')]\r\n\t\t[MyModule.Options]\r\n\t\t$Option\r\n\t)\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Proposal 2: Wildcard\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding()]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t# Lots of other parameters\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetWildcard = 'Set*')]\r\n\t\t[MyModule.Options]\r\n\t\t$Option\r\n\t)\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Proposal 3: Regex\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding()]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t# Lots of other parameters\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetPattern = '^Set\\d$')]\r\n\t\t[MyModule.Options]\r\n\t\t$Option\r\n\t)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## 3) Multiple Sets of Parametersets\r\n\r\nSimply put, too often we have two different sets of parameters, that each within their group are mutually exclusive, but could be freely combined with any one of the options of the other group.\r\n\r\nAn example of how that could look:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding()]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetGroup = 'Group1', ParameterSetName = 'Set1')]\r\n\t\t$Param1,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetGroup = 'Group1', ParameterSetName = 'Set2')]\r\n\t\t$Param2,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetGroup = 'Group1', ParameterSetName = 'Set3')]\r\n\t\t$Param3,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetGroup = 'Group2', ParameterSetName = 'SetA')]\r\n\t\t$Param4,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetGroup = 'Group2', ParameterSetName = 'SetB')]\r\n\t\t$Param5,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetGroup = 'Group2', ParameterSetName = 'SetC')]\r\n\t\t$Param6,\r\n\r\n\t\t$Param7\r\n\t)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding a bit on top: What if another parameter is not actually supported for _all_ parameters of a given group?\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding()]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t[Parameter(Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetGroup = 'Group1', ParameterSetName = 'Set1')]\r\n\t\t$Param1,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetGroup = 'Group1', ParameterSetName = 'Set2')]\r\n\t\t$Param2,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetGroup = 'Group1', ParameterSetName = 'Set3')]\r\n\t\t$Param3,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetGroup = 'Group2', ParameterSetName = 'SetA')]\r\n\t\t$Param4,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetGroup = 'Group2', ParameterSetName = 'SetB')]\r\n\t\t$Param5,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetGroup = 'Group2', ParameterSetName = 'SetC')]\r\n\t\t$Param6,\r\n\r\n\t\t[Parameter(ParameterSetName = @{\r\n\t\t\tGroup1 = 'Set1','Set2'\r\n\t\t\tGroup2 = 'SetA'\r\n\t\t})]\r\n\t\t[switch]\r\n\t\t$Param7,\r\n\r\n\t\t[string]\r\n\t\t$Param8\r\n\t)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure I would be happy with commands that introduce this level of complexity to their parameterization, but it could at least still be handled that way.\r\n\r\n## 4) Impact on the syntax notation\r\n\r\nWith all the proposals above, we would be enabling more complex parameterization situations while - I believe - improving the overall coder experience of defining them. However, we cannot forget the _user_ experience, trying to figure out how to actually use the bloody command!\r\n\r\nHere too I'd like to borrow from [Kirk's excellent post](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/2#issuecomment-177718730). With actual ParameterSetGroups, I believe it to be possible to implement his proposed new form of syntax notation:\r\n\r\n```text\r\nSYNTAX\r\n\tGet-Something {<Group1>} {<Group2>} [-Param8 <String>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n\t{<Group1>}\r\n\tSet1: -Param1 <Object> [-Param7 / {<SetA>}]\r\n\tSet2: -Param2 <Object> [-Param7 / {<SetA>}]\r\n\tSet3: -Param3 <Object>\r\n\r\n\t{<Group2>}\r\n\tSetA: -Param4 <Object> [-Param7 / {<Set1> | <Set2>}]\r\n\tSetB: -Param5 <Object>\r\n\tSetC: -Param6 <Object>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Concluding\r\n\r\nI really hope we can improve the parameterset situation and I believe this to be a step in that direction. Any opinions / counter proposals / further enhancements?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nFred",

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nIs there any mileage or desire for an option that enforces the use of semicolon (and only semicolon) as the command terminator for a given script?\r\n\r\nI regularly find myself at odds between the \"natural\" line-continuation points within the PowerShell language, and where *I* want to place a newline for the long-term readability of my scripts.  As such, I find myself resorting to escaping newlines with the backtick, which I am repeatedly led to believe is *a bad thing™*.\r\n\r\nI completely *understand* why the natural points are what they are, but most of the reasons seem to boil down to the expectation that a newline can terminate the command.  If the script parser could be informed that semicolon was the only command terminator in a given script, it could bypass having to make continuation checks at each newline and make whitespace mostly-insignificant.  This would allow for better alignment of pipelines and command parameters, without having to resort to backtick and without the language seeming to have *opinions* as to where line continuation should happen.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nI see this as an extension to `#Requires` because of its existing script scope, however, the notion of *requiring command termination* is not semantically ideal.  As such, this could reasonably be via any other script-wide directive.  It *could* be a dedicated `Set-CommandTermination` command, or maybe an additional parameter to `Set-StrictMode` (although there may be lexical scope expectations around such).\r\n\r\nIt would certainly need to be an opt-in state, so as not to affect existing scripts.\r\n\r\nIt might be desirable to later extend this to allow for alternate command terminators&mdash;such as `DoubleNewline`&mdash;for those who find semicolons repulsive.\r\n\r\nIt is intended to facilitate such script formatting as the following (which is appreciably my personal preference), without requiring further complex line-continuation checks:\r\n\r\nInstead of...\r\n\r\n    Import-Module DummyExample\r\n    Invoke-DummyPipelineProducer -SomeArgument -OtherArgument |\r\n      Invoke-DummyLongParameterList -SomeSwitch -OtherSwitch -SomeParameter 12345 -Expression (\r\n        Invoke-DummyMethod | Select-Object -First 1) |\r\n      Where-Object { $_.SomeProperty -contains (\r\n        Invoke-DummyFilterList -Type A | Select-Object -First 1) } |\r\n      Select-Object -ExpandProperty Foo |\r\n      ForEach-Object {\r\n        if (-not (Test-Dummy $_)) { Invoke-DummyAction $_ }\r\n        else { Write-Verbose \"$_ already done\" }\r\n      }\r\n\r\n...or the backtick-laden...\r\n\r\n    Import-Module DummyExample\r\n    Invoke-DummyPipelineProducer -SomeArgument -OtherArgument `\r\n      | Invoke-DummyLongParameterList `\r\n          -SomeSwitch `\r\n          -OtherSwitch `\r\n          -SomeParameter 12345 `\r\n          -Expression (Invoke-DummyMethod | Select-Object -First 1) `\r\n      | Where-Object { $_.SomeProperty -contains (\r\n          Invoke-DummyFilterList -Type A | Select-Object -First 1 `\r\n        ) } `\r\n      | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Foo `\r\n      | ForEach-Object {\r\n          if (-not (Test-Dummy $_)) { Invoke-DummyAction $_ }\r\n          else { Write-Verbose \"$_ already done\" }\r\n        }\r\n    \r\n...we could write...\r\n\r\n    #Requires -CommandTermination Semicolon;\r\n    Import-Module DummyExample;\r\n    Invoke-DummyPipelineProducer -SomeArgument -OtherArgument\r\n      | Invoke-DummyLongParameterList\r\n          -SomeSwitch\r\n          -OtherSwitch\r\n          -SomeParameter 12345\r\n          -Expression (Invoke-DummyMethod | Select-Object -First 1)\r\n      | Where-Object { \r\n          $_.SomeProperty -contains (Invoke-DummyFilterList -Type A\r\n                                       | Select-Object -First 1) \r\n        }\r\n      | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Foo\r\n      | ForEach-Object {\r\n          if (-not (Test-Dummy $_)) { Invoke-DummyAction $_ }\r\n          else { Write-Verbose \"$_ already done\" }\r\n        };\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't comment as to how much effort this would add to the script parser.",

    "body": "I have run into a difference in behavior of PS7.x between Windows (success) and Ubuntu 18.04 (failure).  This may be related to #12240, and arose when I parallelized the child item processing using ForEach-Object -Parallel.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the failure is that a PSDrive I define earlier is not found.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install PS7 on each of Windows 10 v2004 and Ubuntu 18.04 on WSL2.\r\n2. Install git\r\n3. Install and Import posh-git and oh-my-posh\r\n4. In profile:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# set $REPOS to a path, for use later\r\n\r\n# then...\r\n\r\nnew-psdrive -name Repos -psprovider FileSystem -root $REPOS\r\n\r\nfunction Get-TimeSinceLastCommit {\r\n    return (git log --pretty=format:'%cr' -1)\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Get-Repos {\r\n    Push-Location Repos:\\\r\n\r\n    $result = Get-ChildItem -Path Repos:\\ -Include .git -recurse -Directory -Hidden -Depth 2 | ForEach-Object -Parallel { $_ | Select-Object Parent, @{label=\"Status\";expression= {Push-Location $_.Parent; $status = Get-GitStatus; Pop-Location; $status}}, @{label=\"Last Commit\";expression={Push-Location $_.Parent; $timeStamp = Get-TimeSinceLastCommit; Pop-Location; $timeStamp}} }\r\n    \r\n    Pop-Location\r\n\r\n    $result\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above fails on Ubuntu, see Actual below.  It can be worked around, by replacing Repos:/ with $REPOS.  But the scripts shouldn't have to differ, let alone because one system doesn't see a PSDrive where the other system does.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAs on Windows:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nParent                                         Status\r\n------                                         ------\r\nC:\\Users\\kfarm\\source\\repos\\Manx               @{HasUntracked=False; Branch=master; HasWorking=True; StashCount=0; Ups…\r\nC:\\Users\\kfarm\\source\\repos\\PowerShell         @{HasUntracked=False; Branch=master; HasWorking=False; StashCount=0; Up…\r\nC:\\Users\\kfarm\\source\\repos\\Aspilogia          @{HasUntracked=False; Branch=master; HasWorking=False; StashCount=0; Up…\r\nC:\\Users\\kfarm\\source\\repos\\Setup              @{HasUntracked=False; Branch=master; HasWorking=False; StashCount=0; Up…\r\nC:\\Users\\kfarm\\source\\repos\\Microsoft\\Terminal @{HasUntracked=False; Branch=master; HasWorking=False; StashCount=0; Up…\r\nC:\\Users\\kfarm\\source\\repos\\WindowsTerminal    @{HasUntracked=False; Branch=master; HasWorking=False; StashCount=0; Up…\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAs on Ubuntu 18.04:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nForEach-Object: /home/kfarmer/repos/PowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile-Linux.ps1:27\r\nLine |\r\n  27 |          | ForEach-Object -Parallel { $_ | Select-Object Parent, @{lab …\r\n     |            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | An unexpected error has occurred while processing ForEach-Object -Parallel input.
