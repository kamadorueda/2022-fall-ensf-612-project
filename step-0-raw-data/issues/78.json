All experimental functionality described below is enabled/disabled using that flag.\r\n- Adds an experimental `-Runspace` parameter `Get-PSBreakpoint`, `Set-PSBreakpoint`, `Enable-PSBreakpoint`, `Disable-PSBreakpoint`, and `Remove-PSBreakpoint`.\r\n- Refactors the classes behind the `*-PSBreakpoint` cmdlets so that they all work consistently. This refactoring did not change the behavior of these cmdlets beyond adding support for runspace breakpoint management.\r\n- Removes the recently added `New-PSBreakpoint` experimental cmdlet in favor of working with the older, more well known `*-PSBreakpoint` cmdlets for runspace breakpoint management.\r\n- Refactors `DebugRunspaceCommand` and `DebugJobCommand` so that they both derive from a common `PSRemoteDebugCmdlet` base class. As part of this refactoring, some of the resource strings have been moved to be co-located with the new base class where they are used.\r\n- Fixes a very minor issue where a remote breakpoint would not be displayed properly in the host when entering a remote debugger.\r\n- Adds `SetCommandBreakpoint`, `SetVariableBreakpoint`, `SetLineBreakpoint`, `EnableBreakpoint`, `DisableBreakpoint`, and `RemoveBreakpoint` public APIs to the `Debugger` class, plumbs them through the engine, and hooks them up for remote debugger work. Also hooks up the `GetBreakpoint`, `GetBreakpoints`, and `SetBreakpoints` `Debugger` class APIs for remote debugger work.\r\n- Adds a `-NoInitialBreak` experimental parameter to `Debug-Runspace` and `Debug-Job` that allows users to attach the debugger without invoking a `BreakAll`. The corresponding methods for the same have boolean parameters allowing this as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThis PR was opened in response to [this discussion](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/8923#issuecomment-503267596) between @TylerLeonhardt, @PaulHigin and I.\r\n\r\nIt helps because:\r\n- It allows scripters to fully manage breakpoints in a remote runspace without having to use `Debug-*` to attach the debugger to that runspace. This provides a better, more PowerShell-oriented approach to debugging.\r\n- It allows @TylerLeonhardt to attach a debugger to a runspace without invoking a `BreakAll` in PSES.\r\n- It simplifies the implementation behind `*-PSBreakpoint` cmdlets.\r\n- The implementation behind `Debug-Runspace` and `Debug-Job`, as defined in `DebugRunspaceCommand` and `DebugJobCommand`, respectively, had a lot of duplicated logic and a few unintentional differences. Moving these classes into a shared base class structure eliminates the unintentional differences and removes the duplicated code.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] Some (experimental features are required if breaking changes are included).\r\n- **Experimental features**\r\n    - [X] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [X] Experimental feature name(s): Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.PSManageBreakpointsInRunspace\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

    "body": "When you have multiple parameter sets that take pipeline input, one by value and another (or others) by property name, if you pipe in the actual object type that is accepted by value that will not necessarily result in the corresponding parameter set being used. This feels wrong, more like a gotcha than how things should actually work.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider `Enable-PSBreakpoint`, `Disable-PSBreakpoint`, and `Remove-PSBreakpoint`.\r\n\r\nEach of those commands has two parameter sets. Let's just call them \"Id\" and \"Breakpoint\" (those may be their actual names, but it doesn't matter). The \"Id\" parameter set has an `int id` parameter that accepts pipeline input by property name. The \"Breakpoint\" parameter set has a `Breakpoint breakpoint` parameter set that accepts pipeline input by value.\r\n\r\n`Enable-PSBreakpoint` is configured to use the \"Id\" parameter set by default. The others are configured to use the \"Breakpoint\" parameter set by default.\r\n\r\nIf you pipe a `Breakpoint` object into each of these cmdlets, the parameter set that is chosen is based on the default parameter set and the properties on the object passed in. For `Enable-PSBreakpoint`, the \"Id\" parameter set is a match because the incoming object has an \"Id\" property, so it is used. For the others, the \"Breakpoint\" parameter set is a match, so it is used.\r\n\r\nI think this is wrong, and feel that if you pipe in an object that _matches exactly_ the type of a parameter that accepts pipeline input by value, that is the most logical choice to use no matter what the default parameter set is. You can only have one `ValueFromPipeline` parameter in a command -- that should be for a good reason like the behavior expected here, but it doesn't really seem like it is.\r\n\r\nAs a command author, if I were building these commands from scratch I would want the \"Id\" parameter set to be the default so that ad hoc users are prompted for an id if they invoke the command with no parameters (prompting them for a breakpoint with no transform attribute to convert from an id to a breakpoint is useless), but I would also most definitely expect that the \"Breakpoint\" parameter set is used if I pipe in an actual \"Breakpoint\" object.\r\n\r\nI suspect at this point this would just be a breaking change. I'm posting this issue here just the same because it can cause unexpected bugs to occur (like the one I just lost an hour to), so users should be aware of this (Is this behavior documented? I'll have to check later). This is also one of those things that I would be inclined to opt into in my modules if I could localize the change so that my commands work more intelligently (i.e. if we had support for optional features as described in an open RFC right now).",

It would be understood that those imports would still go run-space wide and not end when a function ends, but it would simplify being able to encapsulate functions and functions in modules without having a giant list of using namespaces at the top of a file, especially when \"compiling\" multiple separate script cmdlets to a single .psm1 file for performance reasons.\r\n\r\nSince #requires is allowed at a function level, precedent already exists for this functionality.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "In the latest release of powershell 7 preview 2 one of the features listed is support for compiling mofs on linux (#9834). I took this to mean that I could use a linux box to compile mofs that will later be applied to windows machines...\r\n\r\nI spent the best part of today trying to achieve just that but sadly with little success. I am using CentOS 7.6 and have installed [omi](https://github.com/microsoft/omi/releases) and [dsc-for-linx](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerShell-DSC-for-Linux/releases) but after having done so Get-DscResource does not return any resources\r\n\r\nI also tried running a configuration in case it was just a bug with the output but I get the below (CertificateDSC was just one of many stabs in the dark):\r\n```powershell\r\nAt line:6 char:9\r\n+         CertificateImport MyTrustedRoot\r\n+         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\nUndefined DSC resource 'CertificateImport'. Use Import-DSCResource to import the resource.\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : ResourceNotDefined\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know this is a work in progress but will this eventually be a possibility? If so are there any issues/milestones to watch progress towards this goal? Or is it that only the linux specific \"nx\" resources will ever be available on a linux host?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So many installed & uninstalled modules, console settings, C# included tricks have come and passed. I tried to do a factory reset, removed the config.json files, registry settings, uninstalled some modules. Still, there are some leftovers. A module to reset, backup and restore PowerShell environment in the default modules would be helpful. \r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n`Reset-PowershellEnvironment`: Removes all installed modules, cleans profiles, removes Registry settings. By default, it prompts for arguments.\r\n`-Console`: When the switch is defined, only the console settings are removed.\r\n\r\n`-Profile`: When the switch is defined, only the profiles are removed.\r\n\r\n`-Modules`: When the switch is defined, only the modules installed afterward are uninstalled.\r\n\r\n`Backup-PowershellEnvironment`: Backs up the environment settings to an XML or CliXml file.\r\n`Restore-PowershellEnvironment`: Restores the environment  settings from an XML or CliXml file",

    "body": "This issue is reproducible in PS 5.1 and 6.2.1 (and presumably 7 preview since the buggy code is still there, although I didn't test that version specifically yet).\r\n\r\nIf you debug a job, you enter a nested debugging session. From within that session, you can set, enable, disable, or remove breakpoints in the job debugger. Setting or removing breakpoints will result in the same changes made to any breakpoints with the corresponding IDs that were set in the parent debugger.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create a job that does some stuff\r\n$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {\r\n    1..1000 | ForEach-Object {\r\n        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1\r\n        $_\r\n        Write-Error 'boo'\r\n        Write-Verbose 'Verbose' -Verbose\r\n        $DebugPreference = 'Continue'\r\n        Write-Debug 'Debug'\r\n        Write-Warning 'Warning'\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Set some local breakpoints, and remove one\r\n$bp1 = Set-PSBreakpoint -Command Write-Verbose\r\n$bp2 = Set-PSBreakpoint -Command Get-Date\r\n$bp3 = Set-PSBreakpoint -Variable Home -Mode Read -Action {Write-Host 'Read var'}\r\nRemove-PSBreakpoint -Breakpoint $bp2\r\n\r\n# Have a look at your local breakpoints (these do not impact the running job).\r\nGet-PSBreakpoint\r\n\r\n# Wait for the job and its child job to enter a running state\r\nwhile ($job.State -ne 'Running' -or $job.ChildJobs[0].State -ne 'Running') {\r\n    Start-Sleep -Milliseconds 250\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Debug the job\r\nDebug-Job -Job $job\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point you will be in the job debugger. From here, run the following commands:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create a bunch of breakpoints\r\n$jbp1 = Set-PSBreakpoint -Variable DebugPreference\r\n$jbp2 = Set-PSBreakpoint -Command Write-Debug\r\n$jbp3 = Set-PSBreakpoint -Command Start-Sleep\r\n\r\n# Have a look at your job breakpoints\r\nGet-PSBreakpoint\r\n\r\n# Disable the second breakpoint\r\nDisable-PSBreakpoint -Breakpoint $jbp2\r\n\r\n# Remove the last breakpoint\r\nRemove-PSBreakpoint -Breakpoint $jbp3\r\n\r\n# Detach your debugger\r\nd\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you're back in your main runspace, outside of the job. Have a look at your breakpoints by invoking the following command:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-PSBreakpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis output shows that:\r\n- breakpoint 0 was overwritten with a completely different breakpoint (the first one that was set in the job)\r\n- breakpoint 1 was re-created (remember that it was removed before debugging the job), and it's not the same as it was before (note that it is not disabled in the parent even though we disabled it in the job debugger because the code behind that simply disables the breakpoint object again, which is already disabled).\r\n- breakpoint 2 was deleted (remember that it was removed from within the job debugging session)\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n ID Script                            Line Command                           Variable                          Action\r\n  -- ------                            ---- -------                           --------                          ------\r\n   0                                        Write-Verbose\r\n   2                                                                          Home                              Write-Host 'Read var'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n  ID Script                            Line Command                           Variable                          Action\r\n  -- ------                            ---- -------                           --------                          ------\r\n   0                                                                          DebugPreference\r\n   1                                        Write-Debug\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

Command and variable names should either be trimmed so that they contain no extraneous whitespace, or they should raise an error if they contain extraneous whitespace so that there is no ambiguity on the part of the person creating the command or variable.\r\n\r\n1. Set-PSBreakpoint should trim whitespace from string parameters.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAs indicated in the comments above.\r\n\r\n# How we might fix this\r\n\r\n## Define an AutoTrim attribute\r\n\r\nThis attribute would automatically trim string values before they are validated against validation attributes. That corrects the contents for commands, which is helpful; however, it means users can pass in values and get results that are different than those values (i.e. create an alias with leading/trailing whitespace and end up with alias that doesn't have the whitespace). This could hide bugs that exist in calling code.\r\n\r\n## Define a ValidateNoExtraneousWhitespace attribute\r\n\r\nThis attribute would result in an error in the parameter binder if a parameter of type `string` or a parameter that is a collection of type `string` contained strings that included leading or trailing whitespace, forcing the caller to deal with the problem. This is my preferred partial solution to this issue.\r\n\r\n# Questions\r\n\r\nIs there anything we can/should do about provider paths with leading/trailing whitespace? For PowerShell entities such as functions/aliases/variables, we can obviously generate errors if leading/trailing whitespace is used, but since files exist outside of PowerShell and can be created with spaces in Windows (not sure about macOS/Linux, haven't tested there), we probably can't provide a generic solution that prevents use of paths with extraneous whitespace.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

It results in a `TernaryExpressionAst`.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nTernary operator has lower precedence than binary operator, so you can write `$a -eq $b ? \"Hello World\" : [int]::MaxValue`.\r\n\r\nImplicit line continuance for `?` is supported, so you can write\r\n```\r\n$PSEdition -eq 'Core'\r\n    ? \"PowerShell Core\"\r\n    : \"Windows PowerShell\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nToday, `1?2:3` is parsed as a command name as `1?2:3` is considered as a generic token by the tokenizer.\r\nWe don't want to break that, but in certain situation, we know we are expecting an expression and a generic token like `1?2:3` is not useful. In those cases, we want to make the ternary operator chars `?` and `:` to force ending a number token scan.\r\nA new bool field `ForceEndNumbeOnTernaryOpChars` is added to `Tokenizer` and used when scanning number tokens. When the tokenizer is current in `Expression` mode, `ForceEndNumbeOnTernaryOpChars` is `true`, and the current char is `?` or `:`, we force ending the number token.\r\nWith this, we are able to write `$a -gt 2?[int]::MaxValue:3`, `${true}?3:1`, and `-not 1?2:3`.\r\n\r\nCharacters `?` and `:` are valid chars for a variable name, so `$varName?2:3` will be parsed as a variable. In order to write concise ternary expression with a variable condition, you can do this: `${varName}?2:3`.\r\n\r\n### This PR is a draft, not finished yet\r\n\r\nSend out the draft PR to start collecting feedback.\r\nAlso, exercise the CI builds to find regressions.\r\nPending work:\r\n1. Finish examining all visitor usages, and update appropriately. Example, `VariableAnalysis` needs to be updated to account for the ternary operator.\r\n2. Examine if `UpdatePosition` is correctly called at the right place.\r\n2. Add many tests.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [ ] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nStarting on macOS Catalina, all native binaries (command-line and GUI application), as well as all .pkg installer files, must be both code-signed and notarized by Apple, or the system will refuse to run them. Notarizing the .pkg file is easy, since it is already being signed. Notarizing the `pwsh` command-line tool, as well as the `PowerShell.app` wrapper application, will be harder. Note that while notarization is optional on macOS Mojave, it is still supported on that version. We do not (and, IMHO, should not) wait for Catalina's release to start work on this important change.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nWe will need to do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Code-sign the `pwsh` apphost binary with a Developer ID certificate. For notarization to succeed, we must also enable Hardened Runtime on that binary by passing the `-o runtime` flag to the signing tool. We must also use an entitlements file (the correct contents of which are attached at the end of this issue), or else Hardened Runtime will disallow the binary from jitting code or loading third-party dynamic libraries.\r\n2. Code-sign all `*.dylib` files with the Developer ID certificate that is used to sign the apphost binary. No other special steps are required here.\r\n3. Code-sign the `*.app` launcher with the same Developer ID certificate, and enable Hardened Runtime on it as well. While no entitlements are required for the launcher app, we must rewrite the launcher's main executable (which is currently a shell script) in Objective-C, as the macOS code signing process does not support applications with shell scripts as main executables.\r\n4. Notarize all dylibs, the apphost binary, and the launcher app before including them into the installer. You can use `xcrun altool` and `xcrun stapler` to do this.\r\n5. Notarize the `*.pkg` installer once it has been signed.\r\n\r\nNote that the code-signing process is completely independent of the .NET build process, and can easily be run on a .NET CLI-generated apphost binary, as long as the apphost binary in question has been stamped with the appropriate path before it is signed. (After signing, any changes to the binary will invalidate the signature and render the file un-runnable.)\r\n\r\n### Entitlements for `pwsh` tool\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC \"-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN\" \"http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd\">\r\n<plist version=\"1.0\">\r\n<dict>\r\n\t<key>com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory</key>\r\n\t<true/>\r\n\t<key>com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation</key>\r\n\t<true/>\r\n</dict>\r\n</plist>\r\n```",

I must currently manually edit the `sshd_config` file to enable the PowerShell SSH subsystem on each target computer, or otherwise the `New-PSSession` cmdlet will emit a nonintuitive error. (See #9925 for more details.) I would appreciate it if the PowerShell prebuilt installers would add the appropriate code to the `sshd_config` file during installation, so I don't have to remember to do this manually.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nI would add the following code to the macOS after-install script:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngrep -E -q \"^Subsystem\\s*powershell\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config || \\\r\necho \"Subsystem powershell {0} -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile\" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config\r\n```\r\n\r\n(As with the existing code in the macOS after-install script, `{0}` will be replaced with the full path to the pwsh executable.)\r\n\r\nSomething similar ought to be done for the Linux installers; however, I am not fluent enough with the PowerShell Linux packaging to offer any specific implementation plans there.

If an exact match is found, that breakpoint is returned to the caller. Otherwise, the new breakpoint is set and returned to the caller. There is no value in allowing multiple breakpoints that are 100% identical to be set in a debugger. In fact, graphical debuggers don't allow you to do this, so the command line shouldn't either.",

The directory I am running PowerShell from is `C:\\Users\\[username]`.\r\n\r\nExample 1: -Path with no trailing backslash, no -Recurse\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Path 'C:\\Users\\Foo'\r\n```\r\nExample 2: -Path with trailing backslash, no -Recurse\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Path 'C:\\Users\\Foo\\'\r\n```\r\nExample 3: Path with no trailing backslash, -Recurse \r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Path 'C:\\Users\\Foo' -Recurse\r\n```\r\nExample 4: Path with trailing backslash, -Recurse\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Path 'C:\\Users\\Foo\\' -Recurse\r\n```\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nIdeally, all of these would have the same exception thrown. \r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nExample 1: -Path with no trailing backslash, no -Recurse\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem : Cannot find path 'C:\\Users\\Foo' because it does not exist.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Get-ChildItem -path 'C:\\Users\\Foo'\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (C:\\Users\\Foo:String) [Get-ChildItem], ItemNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand\r\n```\r\nExample 2: -Path with trailing backslash, no -Recurse\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem : Cannot find path 'C:\\Users\\Foo\\' because it does not exist.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Get-ChildItem -path 'C:\\Users\\Foo\\'\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (C:\\Users\\Foo\\:String) [Get-ChildItem], ItemNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand\r\n```\r\nExample 3: Path with no trailing backslash, -Recurse \r\n\r\n- No error message regarding the given path is thrown. The cmdlet appears to try to search `C:\\Users\\`, as there are `UnauthorizedAccessExceptions` for something I have in `C:\\Users\\Public` if I do not run PowerShell as administrator. \r\n\r\nExample 4: Path with trailing backslash, -Recurse\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem : Cannot find path 'C:\\Users\\F' because it does not exist.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Get-ChildItem -path 'C:\\Users\\Foo\\' -recurse\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (C:\\Users\\F:String) [Get-ChildItem], ItemNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand\r\n```\r\nThis message occurs even if the path `C:\\Users\\F` exists, which can make it misleading in some cases.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\nThis error occurs both in PS6 and PS7. \r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18932\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18932\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n````\r\n",
