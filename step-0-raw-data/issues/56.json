    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen assigning a struct to a variable, some checks are done to determine if the struct is mutable.  The current code path checks if there are:\r\n\r\n1. Any public instance fields\r\n1. Any public instance properties with a set accessor\r\n1. Any public instance methods\r\n\r\nThis can be simplified by checking if the struct is decorated with the `IsReadOnlyAttribute`.  This would allow PS to assume any struct that wasn't declared explicitly as read only with the C# `readonly` modifier ([SharpLab example](https://sharplab.io/#v2:D4AQzABATgpghgEwPYDsA2BPCBnALlAVwGNcIBZDAZX2NIG8BfIA)) to be mutable.  This would also probably result in *less* false positives because most structs have a public field (even if `initonly`) or a public method, even these explicitly `readonly` structs.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThis method:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/947bddfe0474429672745b939d0ec511392e5879/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs#L2030-L2063\r\n\r\nShould be changed like this:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git a/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs b/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs\r\nindex b54fbdfd5..7a0254ccb 100644\r\n--- a/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs\r\n+++ b/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs\r\n@@ -2034,32 +2034,7 @@ namespace System.Management.Automation.Language\r\n                 return false;\r\n             }\r\n \r\n-            // If there are any fields, the type is mutable.\r\n-            if (type.GetFields(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance).Any())\r\n-            {\r\n-                return true;\r\n-            }\r\n-\r\n-            // If there are any properties with setters, the type is mutable.\r\n-            var properties = type.GetProperties(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance);\r\n-            for (int index = 0; index < properties.Length; index++)\r\n-            {\r\n-                var property = properties[index];\r\n-                if (property.CanWrite)\r\n-                {\r\n-                    return true;\r\n-                }\r\n-            }\r\n-\r\n-            // If there are any methods other than the property getters, the type might\r\n-            // be mutable, so assume the type is mutable.\r\n-            var methods = type.GetMethods(BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Instance);\r\n-            if (methods.Length != properties.Length)\r\n-            {\r\n-                return true;\r\n-            }\r\n-\r\n-            return false;\r\n+            return !type.IsDefined<System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsReadOnlyAttribute>();\r\n         }\r\n \r\n         private static readonly ConcurrentDictionary<Type, bool> s_mutableValueTypesWithInstanceMembers =\r\n```\r\n\r\nRelated issue #12411\r\n\r\n/cc @mklement0 ",

    "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI am using a script ([here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48323495/3399822), that is slightly modified to support web form file upload) that works just fine in PowerShell 5.0 and 5.1 within Windows, which uploads files to a web service.  It reads the file in chunks, and transfers the bytes to the target web service. This is the file I am trying to transfer:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[posh-worker1]: PS C:\\Testing> $file | fl\r\n\r\n    Directory: \\\\fileserver\\share\\dir1\r\n\r\nName           : isoimage1.iso\r\nLength         : 1379500032\r\nCreationTime   : 2/24/2019 10:47:19 PM\r\nLastWriteTime  : 2/24/2019 10:18:15 PM\r\nLastAccessTime : 2/24/2019 10:47:19 PM\r\nMode           : -a---\r\nLinkType       :\r\nTarget         :\r\nVersionInfo    : File:             \\\\fileserver\\share\\dir1\\isoimage1.iso\r\n                 InternalName:\r\n                 OriginalFilename:\r\n                 FileVersion:\r\n                 FileDescription:\r\n                 Product:\r\n                 ProductVersion:\r\n                 Debug:            False\r\n                 Patched:          False\r\n                 PreRelease:       False\r\n                 PrivateBuild:     False\r\n                 SpecialBuild:     False\r\n                 Language:\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run this in either PowerShell Core using a Remote PSSession (when setting `$PSSessionConfigurationName = 'PowerShell.7'` to ensure the remote is PowerShell 7) from a Windows 10 to Windows 10 (both 1909) system, I get the following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nErrorRecord                 : Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.\r\nWasThrownFromThrowStatement : False\r\nTargetSite                  : Void Throw()\r\nStackTrace                  :    at System.Management.Automation.Internal.PipelineProcessor.SynchronousExecuteEnumerate\r\n                              (Object input)\r\n                                 at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.LocalPipeline.InvokeHelper()\r\n                                 at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.LocalPipeline.InvokeThreadProc()\r\nMessage                     : Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.\r\nData                        : {}\r\nInnerException              : System.OutOfMemoryException: Exception of type 'System.OutOfMemoryException' was thrown.\r\n                                 at System.IO.MemoryStream.set_Capacity(Int32 value)\r\n                                 at System.IO.MemoryStream.EnsureCapacity(Int32 value)\r\n                                 at System.IO.MemoryStream.Write(Byte[] buffer, Int32 offset, Int32 count)\r\n                                 at CallSite.Target(Closure , CallSite , Object , Byte[] , Int32 , Object )\r\nHelpLink                    :\r\nSource                      : System.Private.CoreLib\r\nHResult                     : -2146233087\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found some folks talking about how PowerShell limits the amount of RAM allocated to the remote session, which is 150MB.  I adjusted it using the following on the remote system:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-Item WSMan:\\localhost\\Shell\\MaxMemoryPerShellMB 1000000\r\nSet-Item WSMan:\\localhost\\Plugin\\Microsoft.PowerShell\\Quotas\\MaxMemoryPerShellMB 1000000\r\nRestart-Service WinRM\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe very same code is successful without setting `$PSSessionConfigurationName = 'PowerShell.7'` before initiating an Enter-PSSession command.\r\n\r\nThis obviously did not help.  So not sure where else to turn.\r\n\r\nYou may ask why I'm not using something like Invoke-WebRequest?  Well, I need additional progress indicator and HTTPS cert validation that Invoke-WebRequet and Invoke-RestMethod just cannot provide.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI should be able to take the same code I wrote for PowerShell 5.1 to work within PowerShell 7, when using a PS Remote Session.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\n# When setting $PSSessionConfigurationName = 'PowerShell.7' from the initiating client\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n# When NOT setting $PSSessionConfigurationName = 'PowerShell.7' from the initiating client\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.18362.752\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.18362.752\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Note: This problem will go away once #7937 is fixed.\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, if you combine `-ExpandProperty` with `-Property`, the properties passed to `-Property` are added as ETS _instance members_ to the object returned by `-ExpandProperty` (as `NoteProperty` members, as with `Add-Member`). (The way these instance members are added is flawed, as discussed in #7937.)\r\n\r\nIf the object returned happens to be an instance of a _value type_ (check with `[<type>].IsValueType`) that _isn't also a .NET primitive type_ (check with `[<type>].IsPrimitive`) - e.g., `[datetime]` - these instance members are _not_ added.\r\n\r\nThis _may_ be related to the fact that wrapping such types in `[psobject]` seems not to work _when saved to a variable_: e.g., `$v = [psobject] [datetime]::now; $v -is [psobject]` returns `$false`, even though for a reference-type instance (e.g., `[IO.DirectoryInfo]::new('/')`) or a .NET primitive type (e.g., `42`) it would return `$true`.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$o = [pscustomobject] @{ one = [datetime]::now; two = [IO.DirectoryInfo]::new('/') }\r\n\r\n# OK: reference-type instance [IO.DirectoryInfo] is properly decorated\r\n#     with the [datetime] instance as NoteProperty 'one'\r\n$newValue = $o | Select-Object -ExpandProperty two -Property one\r\n$newValue.one | Should -BeOfType System.DateTime\r\n\r\n# BROKEN: The non-primitive [datetime] value-type instance is NOT\r\n#         decorated with the [IO.DirectoryInfo] instance as property 'two'.\r\n#                  Note: The Select-Object return value *must be saved in a variable*\r\n#                        for the bug to surface.\r\n$newValue = $o | Select-Object -ExpandProperty one -Property two\r\n$newValue.two | Should -BeOfType System.IO.DirectoryInfo\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests should succeed.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe second test fails:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected the value to have type [System.IO.DirectoryInfo] or any of its subtypes, but got $null with type $null.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the `[datetime]` instance stored in `$newValue` did _not_ receive the `.two` NoteProperty member.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.1\r\n```\r\n",

Windows System with ADFS Installed\r\n2. Have following AdfsAccessControlPolicy in place\r\n```none\r\nGet-AdfsAccessControlPolicy -name \"Permit specific claim\"\r\n\r\nName           : Permit specific claim\r\nIdentifier     : Permitspecificclaim\r\nIsBuiltIn      : False\r\nRpUsageCount   : 4\r\nLastUpdateTime : 25.03.2019 15:40:00\r\nDescription    :\r\nPolicyMetadata : RequireFreshAuthentication:False\r\n                 IssuanceAuthorizationRules:\r\n                 {\r\n                   Permit users\r\n                     with <ClaimsParameter_0> in the request\r\n                 }\r\n                 ParameterDescription:\r\n                 {\r\n                   <ClaimsParameter_0>: Specify condition with ClaimType, Operator and Value using hashtable.\r\n                 }\r\n```\r\n3. Run script from following Gist [Setup-AdfsApplicationGroup.ps1](https://gist.github.com/thomaslazar/aaf82f53187b77f6ea7072125a6efa68)\r\n\r\nSpecifically this bit is the problem. \r\n```powershell\r\n$acl = @{\r\n    ClaimsParameter_0 = @{ ClaimType = 'http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role'; Operator = 'Contains'; Value = $CustomerGroup }\r\n}\r\n\r\nAdd-AdfsWebApiApplication -ApplicationGroupIdentifier $CustomerId -Identifier \"$CustomerId\" -Name \"$CustomerId - Web Application\" -AccessControlPolicyName \"Permit specific claim\" -AccessControlPolicyParameters $acl -TokenLifetime 15\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nShould run and create an AdfsWebApplication\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nAdd-AdfsWebApiApplication: ADMIN0144: SpecificClaimCondition and SpecificClaimException parameter 'ClaimsParameter_0' should be assigned through a hashtable that specifies ClaimType, Operator and Value. If multiple conditions are desired, use an array of hashtables.\r\n```\r\n# Additional information\r\n\r\nI used dotPeak to look into `Microsoft.IdentityServer.dll`. The problem seems to be the following check inside the `ParameterInterface.cs` `AssignSpecificClaimParemeterFromPSHInput` method , which is not working in PowerShell 7 but is working in PowerShell 5.1\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nif (!(value is Hashtable hashtable))\r\n  throw new InvalidDataException(Microsoft.IdentityServer.SR.GetString(\"ADMIN0144\", (object) specific.Label));\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe content of the variable `value` is the content that got passed into the `AccessControlPolicyParameters` parameter of the `Add-AdfsWebApiApplication` command.\r\n\r\nIt does not matter what you put into the `AccessControlPolicyParameters` parameter. It always triggers this check and throws the exception. \r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS C:\\Temp> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

For this reason `-ireplace` and `-replace` \"share\" the same error message.\r\n\r\nCloses #12333 \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [X] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

This means something like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ncode temp:/test.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nnow works as expected.  Also, on Windows, if the path starts with `~`, then that will get resolved before passing to a native command.  In both cases, the path is normalized to the directory separators for the relevant operating system.  Note:\r\n\r\n- if the path is not a psdrive nor ~ (on Windows), then path normalization doesn't occur\r\n- if the path is in single quotes, then it's not resolved and treated as literal\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10675\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11386\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [x] Experimental feature name(s): PSNativePSPathResolution\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/5848\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

A lot of these scripts are based native cmdlets (or 3rd party cmdlets that are based on native cmdlet) presuming passing expressions (or rebuilding expressions) is a general safe thing to do (but I question that).  \r\n\r\nThe [`Invoke-Expression is considered harmful`](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/invoke-expression-considered-harmful/) but that is [primarily about preventing *unintended* execution of code (code injection)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56988348/1701026) but what about preventing against any deliberate malicious code injections?\r\n\r\nCmdlets that directly invoke commands/expressions (like `Start-Job`, `Invoke-Command`  and the Call Operator `&`) are quiet obvious  commands to exploit for an an attacker and a developer will probably focus on that but passing (or *partly* passing) a script to a calculated expression as e.g. the `Sort-Object` cmdlet could also be possibly exploit by a hacker (if not specially handled).\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\nIn this example I build a `ScriptBlock` from a variable to give the user the possibly to select for a column to be sorted (a little cumbersome for this but the requirements are usually a lot more complex).\r\nCounter measurements are taken:\r\n* Against anybody tempering the PowerShell code by signing it and setting the related policies\r\n* Using `Import-PowerShellDataFile` to load the data\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$Data = ConvertFrom-Csv @'\r\nName,Value\r\nOne,1\r\nTwo,2\r\nThree,3\r\n'@\r\n\r\n$Sort = 'Name' # Retrieved via Import-PowerShellDataFile\r\nData | Sort ([ScriptBlock]::Create(\"`$_.$Sort\"))\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt the first look this code might look safe from malicious attacks but is ***not***.\r\nThru this code, a hacker might make changes to locations along with the file system, registry, etc. by injecting code via PowerShellDataFile which will change the `$Sort` variable to something like:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n $Sort = \"Name; 'Test' | Add-Content '.\\Test.txt';\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Is there any *common* way to **safely** pass expressions (or parts) to other cmdlets?\r\n* Is it possible to equip any of the existing commands that invoke expressions (like `Start-ThreadJob`) with a parameter that [Run Partially Trusted Code in a Sandbox](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/misc/how-to-run-partially-trusted-code-in-a-sandbox), meaning that the only connection for that script with the outside world would be the input (parameters) and the output of the script?\r\n* Shouldn't cmdlets (like `Sort-Object`) have any standard mechanism that prevents tempering with the system? meaning that these (calculated) expressions are only allowed to supply an output to the concerned cmdlet and noting else...\r\n",
