    "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Download the MSI for v7.2.2 and run it.\r\n   a. Use a custom directory (in my case I choose `D:\\PowerShell`)\r\n   b. Untick the options to update automatically through Windows Update or WSUS.\r\n2. Now download the MSI for v7.2.3 and run it.\r\n3. When you reach the page for the installation directory, it shows the default directory in `C:\\Program Files`.\r\n4. When you reach the page for automatic updates, both options are ticked.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe installer for a new version should respect the options that were selected for the previous verison.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe installer for a new version uses the default options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nThis could be related to #17211, which is about the original installation directory not being respected when PowerShell is automatically updated through Windows Update.",

Thanks for taking an interest!\r\n\r\nI'm running get user against the Graph web API using `invoke-restmethod.` In production, I would pull multiple users, so I was testing performance potential with `foreach-object -parallel` over my current `foreach ($i in $is) {}`. The iterated call using `-parallel` errored with _'CompactToken parsing failed with error code: 80049217.'_ To make sure I didn't have a stale token or syntax issue, I ran the same code without the -parallel switch The calls were successful. If I place the token string directly into the code when using '-parallel' the calls are also successful. All three scenarios are shown in screenshots below.\r\n\r\nIn our discussion, I mentioned I thought it was related to wrapping my token variable in '$()' but I've tried it the code just passing the variable directly without the wrap with the same results. It was a red herring with from extranious code. :)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\n1..2 | ForEach-Object -parallel { $account_params = @{\r\n>>         Headers     = @{Authorization = \"Bearer $GraphApiKey\" }\r\n>>         URI         = \"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/test.user1@wirelessoneonline.com\"\r\n>>         Method      = 'GET'\r\n>>         ContentType = 'application/json'\r\n>>     }\r\n>>     Invoke-RestMethod @Account_params }\r\n\r\n@odata.context    : https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity\r\nbusinessPhones    : {}\r\ndisplayName       : Test User1\r\ngivenName         : Test\r\njobTitle          :\r\nmail              : test.user1@wirelessoneonline.com\r\nmobilePhone       :\r\nofficeLocation    :\r\npreferredLanguage :\r\nsurname           : User1\r\nuserPrincipalName : test.user1@wirelessoneonline.com\r\nid                : 1ff9a221-6c9f-4402-a737-aa48058c8eb3\r\n\r\n@odata.context    : https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#users/$entity\r\nbusinessPhones    : {}\r\ndisplayName       : Test User1\r\ngivenName         : Test\r\njobTitle          :\r\nmail              : test.user1@wirelessoneonline.com\r\nmobilePhone       :\r\nofficeLocation    :\r\npreferredLanguage :\r\nsurname           : User1\r\nuserPrincipalName : test.user1@wirelessoneonline.com\r\nid                : 1ff9a221-6c9f-4402-a737-aa48058c8eb3\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nC:\\> 1..2 | ForEach-Object -Parallel { $account_params = @{\r\n>>         Headers     = @{Authorization = \"Bearer $GraphApiKey\" }\r\n>>         URI         = \"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/test.user1@wirelessoneonline.com\"\r\n>>         Method      = 'GET'\r\n>>         ContentType = 'application/json'\r\n>>     }\r\n>>     Invoke-RestMethod @Account_params }\r\nInvoke-RestMethod:\r\nLine |\r\n   7 |      Invoke-RestMethod @Account_params\r\n     |      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | {\"error\":{\"code\":\"InvalidAuthenticationToken\",\"message\":\"CompactToken parsing failed with error code: 80049217\",\"innerError\":{\"date\":\"2022-04-28T05:57:52\",\"request-id\":\"8029d99f-fdff-4f53-8de3-ece7bb49865a\",\"client-request-id\":\"8029d99f-fdff-4f53-8de3-ece7bb49865a\"}}}\r\nInvoke-RestMethod:\r\nLine |\r\n   7 |      Invoke-RestMethod @Account_params\r\n     |      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | {\"error\":{\"code\":\"InvalidAuthenticationToken\",\"message\":\"CompactToken parsing failed with error code: 80049217\",\"innerError\":{\"date\":\"2022-04-28T05:57:52\",\"request-id\":\"4fa35fd4-041e-4823-9bd9-33a9ad62b847\",\"client-request-id\":\"4fa35fd4-041e-4823-9bd9-33a9ad62b847\"}}}\r\nC:\\>\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nC:\\> get-error\r\n\r\nException             :\r\n    Type       : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.HttpResponseException\r\n    Response   : StatusCode: 401, ReasonPhrase: 'Unauthorized', Version: 1.1, Content: System.Net.Http.HttpConnectionResponseContent,\r\nHeaders:\r\n                 {\r\n                 Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n                 Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000\r\n                 request-id: 4fa35fd4-041e-4823-9bd9-33a9ad62b847\r\n                 client-request-id: 4fa35fd4-041e-4823-9bd9-33a9ad62b847\r\n                 x-ms-ags-diagnostic: {\"ServerInfo\":{\"DataCenter\":\"West US\r\n2\",\"Slice\":\"E\",\"Ring\":\"1\",\"ScaleUnit\":\"001\",\"RoleInstance\":\"MW2PEPF000031CD\"}}\r\n                 WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm=\"\", authorization_uri=\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/authorize\",\r\nclient_id=\"00000003-0000-0000-c000-000000000000\"\r\n                 Date: Thu, 28 Apr 2022 05:57:51 GMT\r\n                 Content-Type: application/json\r\n                 }\r\n    TargetSite :\r\n        Name          : ThrowTerminatingError\r\n        DeclaringType : System.Management.Automation.MshCommandRuntime, System.Management.Automation, Version=7.2.3.500,\r\nCulture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\r\n        MemberType    : Method\r\n        Module        : System.Management.Automation.dll\r\n    Message    : Response status code does not indicate success: 401 (Unauthorized).\r\n    Source     : System.Management.Automation\r\n    HResult    : -2146233088\r\n    StackTrace :\r\n   at System.Management.Automation.MshCommandRuntime.ThrowTerminatingError(ErrorRecord errorRecord)\r\nTargetObject          : Method: GET, RequestUri: 'https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/test.user1@wirelessoneonline.com', Version:\r\n1.1, Content: System.Net.Http.StringContent, Headers:\r\n                        {\r\n                        Authorization: Bearer\r\n                        User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0\r\n                        User-Agent: (Windows NT 10.0;

One or more parameters issued cannot be used together or an insufficient number of parameters were provided.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tried both newer PowerShell versions as well as Windows PowerShell, and since the problem exists in several versions of the documentation I suspect it's an old bug.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> $Cred = [pscredential]::new('test', ('123' | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText))\r\nPS> Invoke-Command -Credential $Cred -ScriptBlock { 'Hello world' }\r\nHello world\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> $Cred = [pscredential]::new('test', ('123' | ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText))\r\nPS> Invoke-Command -Credential $Cred -ScriptBlock { 'Hello world' }\r\nInvoke-Command: Parameter set cannot be resolved using the specified named parameters. One or more parameters issued cannot be used together or an insufficient number of parameters were provided.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nException             :\r\n    Type              : System.Management.Automation.ParameterBindingException\r\n    Message           : Parameter set cannot be resolved using the specified named parameters.

    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTest-Connection with the -quiet parameter is performing inversely to what the microsoft documents state it will. The description of -quiet states \"If any ping to a given target succeeds, $True is returned. If all pings to a given target fail, $False is returned.\" I can confirm this works as described in Powershell 5.1, but in 7+ it appears to work inversely. If any of the the replies are fail then the bool returns $false. I have tested it several times and it has always reproduced the same results.

It's OK to install using the .msi file. I didn't see this MSIX package's hash value in release note, either, but it's truly within the assets. What's wrong with this?\r\n\r\nBtw I found this problem when try to use WinGet-Create to update the manifest of Powershell in winget-pkg, and winget-create reports an System.IO.FileNotFoundException error. I guess it's the same problem with what I encountered as below.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nMSIX package installed successfully.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nWindows Application Installer tells me it is not signatured ans thus not trusted.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nCurrent Version: 7.2.2\r\nWant to update to: 7.2.3\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

The scriptblock receives an `$Inventory` parameter, which is a nested C#  object (depth > 1). It seems that the parameter is only serialized with `depth=1`. Based on `$Inventory | Export-Clixml \"$env:TEMP\\f2.txt\"` I can see that the CLI-XML doesn't contain nested information.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar wsManInfo = new WSManConnectionInfo();\r\nvar runSpace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace(wsManInfo);\r\nrunSpace.Open();\r\nvar powerShell = PowerShell.Create();\r\npowerShell.Runspace = runSpace;\r\npowerShell.AddScript(@\"\r\nParam($Inventory)\r\n\r\n\r\n$Inventory | Export-Clixml \"\"$env:TEMP\\f2.txt\"\"\r\n\r\n\r\n$Inventory.SoftwareInventory.Groups[0].Software\r\n\r\n\").AddParameter(\"Inventory\", variables);\r\nvar results = powerShell.Invoke();\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be great to create an option to set the serialization depth of custom objects.\r\n\r\nActually the depth is `1`, based on `PSObject`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  public virtual void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)\r\n        {\r\n            if (info == null)\r\n            {\r\n                throw PSTraceSource.NewArgumentNullException(nameof(info));\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // We create a wrapper PSObject, so that we can successfully deserialize it\r\n            string serializedContent;\r\n            if (this.ImmediateBaseObjectIsEmpty)\r\n            {\r\n                PSObject serializeTarget = new PSObject(this);\r\n                serializedContent = PSSerializer.Serialize(serializeTarget);\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                serializedContent = PSSerializer.Serialize(this);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            info.AddValue(\"CliXml\", serializedContent);\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs it possible to set the serialization depth via the API?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nA custom object shall be serialized in required depth.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nA custom object is serialized with depth=1.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.SDK 7.2.2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

There is a workaround described, which indeed works, however a permanent solution should be implemented to fix this issue as, in my opinion, this is a use case which worked before out of box and should continue to work out of box with the official Docker image.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work on PowerShell.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPowerShell credential request\r\nEnter your credentials.\r\nUser: xxx@xxxx.com\r\nPassword for user x: *********************\r\n\r\n…\r\n\r\nPS>\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPowerShell credential request\r\nEnter your credentials.\r\nUser: xxx@xxxx.com\r\nPassword for user x: *********************\r\n\r\npwsh: symbol lookup error: /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/libmi.so: undefined symbol: SSL_library_init\r\n# exits docker container runtime\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\n# I cannot execute Get-Error afterwards because PowerShell is forcefully exiting the session\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nPS> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Linux 5.16.0-5-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 5.16.14-1 (2022-03-15)\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nPS>\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

However I have chosen to implement this as a seperate attribute as users who work with strings know to use a seperate attribute when validating them: `ValidateNotNullOrEmpty` as opposed to `ValidateNotNull`. `ValidateNotNullOrEmpty` adds a further requirement for the validation over `ValidateNotNull`. Likewise `ValidateNotNullOrWhiteSpace` adds the further requirement of no strings consisting entirely of white-space over `ValidateNotNullOrEmpty`. \r\n\r\nAlso, this is my first commit 😊\r\n\r\n### Class Diagram Before\r\n```mermaid\r\nclassDiagram\r\n    ValidateArgumentsAttribute <|-- NullValidationAttributeBase\r\n    NullValidationAttributeBase <|-- ValidateNotNullAttribute\r\n    NullValidationAttributeBase <|-- ValidateNotNullOrEmptyAttribute\r\n    class ValidateArgumentsAttribute {\r\n        <<abstract>>\r\n        #Validate(object arguments, EngineIntrinsics engineIntrinsics)* void\r\n    }\r\n    class NullValidationAttributeBase {\r\n        <<abstract>>\r\n        #IsArgumentCollection(Type argumentType, out bool isElementValueType) bool\r\n    }\r\n    class ValidateNotNullAttribute{\r\n        #Validate(object arguments, EngineIntrinsics engineIntrinsics) void\r\n    }\r\n    class ValidateNotNullOrEmptyAttribute{\r\n        #Validate(object arguments, EngineIntrinsics engineIntrinsics) void\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n### Class Diagram After\r\n```mermaid\r\nclassDiagram\r\n    ValidateArgumentsAttribute <|-- NullValidationAttributeBase\r\n    NullValidationAttributeBase <|-- ValidateNotNullAttribute\r\n    NullValidationAttributeBase <|-- ValidateNotNullOr\r\n    ValidateNotNullOr <|-- ValidateNotNullOrEmptyAttribute\r\n    ValidateNotNullOr <|-- ValidateNotNullOrWhiteSpaceAttribute\r\n    class ValidateArgumentsAttribute {\r\n        <<abstract>>\r\n        #Validate(object arguments, EngineIntrinsics engineIntrinsics)* void\r\n    }\r\n    class NullValidationAttributeBase {\r\n        <<abstract>>\r\n        #IsArgumentCollection(Type argumentType, out bool isElementValueType) bool\r\n    }\r\n    class ValidateNotNullAttribute{\r\n        #Validate(object arguments, EngineIntrinsics engineIntrinsics) void\r\n    }\r\n    class ValidateNotNullOr{\r\n        <<abstract>>\r\n        #bool _whiteSpace\r\n        #ValidateNotNullOr(bool whiteSpace)*\r\n        #Validate(object arguments, EngineIntrinsics engineIntrinsics) void\r\n    }\r\n    class ValidateNotNullOrEmptyAttribute {\r\n        +ValidateNotNullOrEmptyAttribute(bool whiteSpace)\r\n    }\r\n    class ValidateNotNullOrWhiteSpaceAttribute {\r\n        +ValidateNotNullOrWhiteSpaceAttribute(bool whiteSpace)\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.",

BROKEN: Select-String doesn't bind to -LiteralPath and instead searches the\r\n# !!                  stringified object.\r\n$o | Select-String .\r\n\r\nRemove-Item $tmpFile # cleanup\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nzzz\r\n\r\n/path/to/tmpfile.tmp:1:zzz\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nzzz\r\n\r\n@{PSPath=/path/to/tmpfile.tmp}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, `Select-String` unexpectedly searched the `.ToString()` representation of the input object that was bound to `-InputObject`.\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 7.3.0-preview.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nWe all know the code constructs like this:\r\n```Powershell\r\n$Temp = $ErrorActionPreference\r\n$ErrorActionPreference = \"stop\"\r\n(Doing Stuff)\r\n$ErrorActionPreference = $Temp\r\n```\r\nWith any of the many available preference variables. When \"Doing Stuff\" is only calling one cmdlet, this can easily be simplified using the `-ErrorAction \"silentlycontinue\"` parameter, but when you need to set it for multiple calls and some in-between lines of code, that can get very annoying and confusing.\r\n\r\nWhen working with locations, you could use `Push-Location` and `Pop-Location` to make your code very concise and easy to read. Something similar for preference variables would simplify code snippets like the example above a lot.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nSince preference variables are mutable enums, I don't think for example `$ErrorActionPreference.Push(\"stop\")` would work, instead cmdlets like `Push-ErrorActionPreference \"stop\"` similar to locations would need to be made.\r\n\r\nAlso some thought would need to be put into how this would work in conjunction with the common parameter `-ErrorAction`, for example that every time the parameter is explicitly specified, it gets pushed, and on end of the cmdlet, it is popped.",

Start PowerShell.\r\n2. Set keyboard to the other language (like with `Alt + Shift` or in the taskbar).\r\n3. Press `Ctrl + C` (or `Ctrl + <Any letter>`).\r\n4. Terminal will print the letter (or something like � if the font doesn't have it) instead of the expected `^C`.\r\n5. Even if you switch back to English and `Ctrl + C` it will still print the letter from the other language.\r\n\r\nI didn't find a way to \"fix\" the session to make `Ctrl + C` work, only thing you can do is close it, open a new one and making sure the first  `Ctrl + C` you make is in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n`^C` always executed no matter what is your current active keyboard or what keyboard was active when it was first typed. Like in CMD for example.\r\n```console\r\nPS C:\\> ^C\r\nPS C:\\>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n`Ctrl + C` become unusable for the rest of the session if when it first used the keyboard wasn't on English.\r\n```console\r\nPS C:\\> ב\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n![Animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6960531/164839296-6110cbfe-e044-4983-aec7-6925f885ad99.gif)\r\n",

For example, consider the following sample code.\r\n\r\nAn object is created with multiple PSCustomObjects added containing the first and last names of users:\r\n```powershell\r\n$OldFile = @()\r\n\r\n$OldFile += [PSCustomObject]@{firstName = 'Peter'; lastName = 'Hall'}\r\n\r\n$OldFile += [PSCustomObject]@{firstName = 'Peter'; lastName = 'Griffin'}\r\n\r\n$OldFile += [PSCustomObject]@{firstName = 'Peter'; lastName = 'Greenwood'}\r\n\r\n$OldFile += [PSCustomObject]@{firstName = 'Jane'; lastName = 'Greenwood'} \r\n\r\n$OldFile += [PSCustomObject]@{firstName = 'John'; lastName = 'Greenwood'}\r\n\r\n$OldFile += [PSCustomObject]@{firstName = 'James'; lastName = 'Greenwood'}\r\n\r\n$OldFile\r\n\r\n\r\nfirstName lastName\r\n--------- --------\r\nPeter     Hall\r\nPeter     Griffin\r\nPeter     Greenwood\r\nJane      Greenwood\r\nJohn      Greenwood\r\nJames     Greenwood\r\n```\r\n\r\nFiltering the object to exclude users with a first name of 'Peter' and last name of 'Hall' incorrectly excludes Peter Griffin and Peter Greenwood too:\r\n```powershell\r\n$OldFile | Where-Object {$_.firstName -ne 'Peter' -and $_.lastName -ne 'Hall'}\r\n\r\n\r\nfirstName lastName\r\n--------- --------\r\nJane      Greenwood\r\nJohn      Greenwood\r\nJames     Greenwood\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this is the intended behaviour, reversing the logic should see Peter Hall, Peter Griffin, and Peter Greenwood included in the results, but this is not the case:\r\n```powershell\r\n$OldFile | Where-Object {$_.firstName -eq 'Peter' -and $_.lastName -eq 'Hall'}\r\n\r\n\r\nfirstName lastName\r\n--------- --------\r\nPeter     Hall\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$OldFile | Where-Object {$_.firstName -ne 'Peter' -and $_.lastName -ne 'Hall'}\r\n\r\n\r\nfirstName lastName\r\n--------- --------\r\nPeter     Griffin\r\nPeter     Greenwood\r\nJane      Greenwood\r\nJohn      Greenwood\r\nJames     Greenwood\r\n\r\n# Peter Griffin and Peter Greenwood are correctly included in the results.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$OldFile | Where-Object {$_.firstName -ne 'Peter' -and $_.lastName -ne 'Hall'}\r\n\r\n\r\nfirstName lastName\r\n--------- --------\r\nJane      Greenwood\r\nJohn      Greenwood\r\nJames     Greenwood\r\n\r\n# Peter Griffin and Peter Greenwood are incorrectly excluded from the results.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$PSVersionTable                                                       \r\n\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Darwin 21.4.0 Darwin Kernel Version 21.4.0: Fri Mar 18 00:46:32 PDT 2022; root:x…\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

    "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nPowerShell now expands the globs when using native commands on Linux. This is very inconvenient to me for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n- I use PowerShell on both Linux and Windows, and I have to always be cautious so that I don't make mistakes. (I can use `git checkout master -- *` on Windows, but I have to quote the `*` on Linux. It was really scary when I once ran `yarn up **` on Linux...)\r\n- When working with `bash`, I know that it will always expand the globs I use. When working with PowerShell on Windows, I know that it will never do that. But on Linux, it has an inconsistent behavior that I have to think about before running commands. (This gets worse when the same command can mean different things on Windows and Linux, like `rm` and `ls` and the likes.)\r\n- PowerShell glob expansion still needs work (#15959 and #13098 for example), and I don't want to get caught in the middle of my work.\r\n- I don't like glob expansion in bash anyways. It is a somewhat scary feature to me. (I almost always quote my wildcards in bash, if the command I'm using recognizes them (like `git`), or switch to PowerShell if it doesn't.)\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nAdd a configuration to PowerShell to disable glob expansion on Linux, or if such configuration already exists, include a mention to it in the docs ([here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/unix-support) for example).",

However starting it directly doesn't give me a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see what I mean try the following from within pwsh on Ubuntu\r\n\r\n1. `Start-Process mono /opt/chocolatey/choco.exe`\r\n2. I get this: `PS /home/onorio_developer> ;28R`\r\n3. Then I Ctrl+C and I get the expected Chocolatey prompt.  \r\n4. If I hit Ctrl+C again I get the same `;28R` again \r\n\r\nWhereas if I run this:\r\n`mono /opt/chocolatey/choco.exe`\r\nI get the expected Chocolatey prompt with no random ANSI escape sequences.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nShould show chocolatey help message and exit\r\n\r\n(See screenshot)\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nOutputs partial ANSI Escape sequence before and after showing chocolatey help message.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNothing is returned by Get-Error\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n$PSVersionTable:\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Linux 5.14.0-1033-oem #36-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 4 15:15:49 UTC 2022\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nMono:\r\nMono JIT compiler version 6.12.0.122 (tarball Mon Feb 22 17:33:28 UTC 2021)\r\nCopyright (C) 2002-2014 Novell, Inc, Xamarin Inc and Contributors. www.mono-project.com\r\n\tTLS:           __thread\r\n\tSIGSEGV:       altstack\r\n\tNotifications: epoll\r\n\tArchitecture:  amd64\r\n\tDisabled:      none\r\n\tMisc:          softdebug \r\n\tInterpreter:   yes\r\n\tLLVM:          yes(610)\r\n\tSuspend:       hybrid\r\n\tGC:            sgen (concurrent by default)\r\n\r\nChocolatey:\r\nChocolatey v0.12.1-155-g2f5b02d8\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\nError behavior:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-04-21 19-26-55](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/153365/164567158-0d87c84e-963c-465a-b7f3-e265c103221a.png)\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n![Screenshot from 2022-04-21 19-27-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/153365/164567180-e30c7c37-5c45-4a0c-ac14-9ea38ef90c43.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nUsing `Get-ChildItem`, can anyone advise whether it's possible to non-recursively list files where the directory is specified as a LiteralPath and the filename(s) returned must match a given string containing wildcards?\r\n\r\nThis is the closest I've managed to get:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -LiteralPath \"C:\\Bitbucket\\Test\\foo[1-5]bar\" -Filter \"*.doc\" -File\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `-Filter` parameter uses the FileSystem provider rather than PowerShell wildcards _(`Get-Help about_Wildcard`)_. PowerShell wildcards are well understood and it's unlikely that the syntax will ever change dramatically (or at least not in a breaking change way). Whereas, when relying on the FileSystem provider for filtering, although there are many similarities to PowerShell wildcards, PowerShell has no influence over its behaviour, you are completely at the mercy of .Net Core and this makes me feel it's a potentially risky proposition to use.\r\n\r\n_(The behaviour of `-Filter` has changed dramatically between Windows PowerShell and Powershell Core. To illustrate this, in Windows PowerShell if `C:\\Bitbucket\\Test\\foo[1-5]bar` contained both `.doc` and `.docx` files then `Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath \"C:\\Bitbucket\\Test\\foo[1-5]bar\" -Filter \"*.doc\" -File` would return files with both extensions, whereas this is not the case in PowerShell Core)_ \r\n\r\nHere are a couple of workarounds I've come up with... I'm not entirely sure if I'd trust the second option just in case there are any quirks or edge cases that I've failed to consider.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n################################################################################\r\n# WORKAROUND 1\r\n# Delegate responsibility for filtering to the Where method.\r\n(Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath \"C:\\Bitbucket\\Test\\foo[1-5]bar\" -File).Where({$_.name -like \"*.doc\"})\r\n################################################################################\r\n# WORKAROUND 2\r\n# Use Get-ChildItem with a non-literal path to take advantage of PowerShell's\r\n# wildcard filtering but before doing so, check that the directory path \r\n# \"literally\" exists, the filename is a value that can only be interpreted as a \r\n# file (not a directory) by ensuring that it does NOT contain any path \r\n# separators (\"\\\" or \"/\") and then escape the directory path.\r\n$DirectoryPath = \"C:\\Bitbucket\\Test\\foo[1-5]bar\"\r\n$Filename = \"*.doc\"\r\n\r\nIf (Test-Path -LiteralPath $DirectoryPath -Type Container) {\r\n    If (!($Filename.ToCharArray().Where({ ('\\', '/').contains([string]$_.ToString()) }))) {\r\n        $DirectoryPathEscaped = [Management.Automation.WildcardPattern]::Escape($DirectoryPath)\r\n        Get-ChildItem -Path \"$DirectoryPathEscaped\\$Filename\" -File\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n################################################################################\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI'd be delighted if someone could tell me of a way to achieve the result I want using nothing but `Get-ChildItem`, however if that's simply not possible at present then I'd like to ask the PowerShell team and the community to consider whether it would be feasible and desirable to add new functionality that (somehow) enables a user to modify the behaviour of `-Filter` so that it can \r\noperate using PowerShell wildcard filtering?\r\n\r\nCan anyone comment on whether the implementation of such a feature would theoretically offer performance benefits over using the `Where` method _(as shown in 'workaround 1')_ to perform filtering?",

Type `Get-PSReadlineOption | Format-List *`\r\n\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n**To resolve:**\r\n\r\n1. Type `Get-PSReadLineOption` (without `| Format-List *`) and color scheme is restored after the property `CommandColor` is listed on-screen.  See bottom screenshot for a better explanation of this.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\nColor scheme should remain constant\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n- Console color scheme now appears like the `ListPredictionSelectedColor` color scheme\r\n- Missing property values (see screenshot)\r\n- Clearing the screen/changing console size doesn't resolve the issue.",

With UAC, apps and tasks always run in the security context of a non-administrator account, unless an administrator specifically authorizes administrator-level access to the system. UAC can block the automatic installation of unauthorized apps and prevent inadvertent changes to system settings.*\r\n\r\nFor Windows servers and where the Execution Policy is lowered, malware might easily copy itself to the user's profile (`$PROFILE.CurrentUserCurrentHost`) and proceed (unnoticed!) with elevated rights whenever the user starts PowerShell from the explorer '**Run as Administrator**' context menu.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nForeign scripts should not be able to pass UAC and execute unseen by piggybacking on other domestic scripts as the `$Profile`.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nPowerShell is able to silently copy and invoke (possible malicious) code accepted by the *standard user* account in an *elevated administrator* account.\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n```powershell\r\n$PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propose\r\n\r\nAs a practical workaround, I would recommend to restrict the Execution Policy when PowerShell is ran as administrator by setting the `$PROFILE.AllUsersAllHosts` as a standard (knowing administrators should be able to consciously change this).\r\nBasically (from an elevated prompt):\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nSet-Content $PROFILE.AllUsersCurrentHost { # or $PROFILE.AllUsersAllHosts?\r\n    $WindowsIdentity  = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()\r\n    $WindowsPrincipal = [System.Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal]::new($WindowsIdentity)\r\n    if ($WindowsPrincipal.IsInRole([System.Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {\r\n        Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope Process\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis would require the user to (re)sign the $Profile when modified. Signing should be limited to a specific \"CodeSigners\" group and self-signing can only be done with elevated rights.  \r\n(Other possibilities to achieve the same results might be using a separate user/admin execution policies and/or changing the explorer context menu)\r\n\r\nThis will cause user profiles to be disabled if not signed when running as an elevated administrator:\r\n<img width=\"674\" alt=\"2022-04-13_17h25_53\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8080834/163215538-44c5e935-11bb-4d42-8bb3-cccc248d5fe9.png\">\r\n\r\n<sub>(not sure how this whole issue would apply to other operating systems)</sub>",

    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nPreviously I've been able to read event logs in user context using `Get-Winevent -FilterHashTable`. For some reason, I don't have permissions to filter the logs with `-FilterHashTable`. This can be tested with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n#Create Provider: \"Test\"\r\nNew-EventLog -LogName Application -Source \"Test\" -ErrorAction Ignore\r\n\r\n#Create an event under the provider we just created\r\nWrite-EventLog -LogName \"Application\" -Source \"Test\" -EventID 100 -EntryType Information -Message \"This is a test message\"\r\n\r\n#Filter out the event we just created\r\nGet-WinEvent -ErrorAction Ignore -FilterHashtable @{\r\n    ProviderName = \"Test\";\r\n    LogName      = \"Application\";\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I run the last command as an Administrator however, it works. I can also find the event without `-FilterHashTable` (in user context) :\r\n\r\n```\r\n$logs = Get-WinEvent -LogName \"Application\" -MaxEvents 1000 -ErrorAction Ignore\r\n$logs | Where-Object {$_.ProviderName -eq \"Test\"}\r\n\r\n   ProviderName: Test\r\n\r\nTimeCreated                     Id LevelDisplayName Message\r\n-----------                     -- ---------------- -------\r\n2022-04-13 09:21:48            100 Information      This is a test message\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTested on both PowerShell 5.1 (which comes shipped with W11) and PowerShell 7.2.2.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{\r\n    ProviderName = \"Test\";\r\n    LogName      = \"Application\";\r\n}\r\nProviderName: Test\r\n\r\nTimeCreated                     Id LevelDisplayName Message\r\n-----------                     -- ---------------- -------\r\n2022-04-13 09:21:48            100 Information      This is a test message\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS> Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{\r\n    ProviderName = \"Test\";\r\n    LogName      = \"Application\";\r\n}\r\nGet-WinEvent: There is not an event provider on the localhost computer that matches \"Test\".\r\nGet-WinEvent: The specified providers do not write events to any of the specified logs.\r\nGet-WinEvent: The parameter is incorrect.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS> Get-Error\r\nException             :\r\n    Type       : System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogException\r\n    Message    : The parameter is incorrect.\r\n    TargetSite :\r\n        Name          : Throw\r\n        DeclaringType : System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogException\r\n        MemberType    : Method\r\n        Module        : System.Diagnostics.EventLog.dll\r\n    Source     : System.Diagnostics.EventLog\r\n    HResult    : -2146233088\r\n    StackTrace :\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogException.Throw(Int32 errorCode)\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.NativeWrapper.EvtQuery(EventLogHandle session, String path, String query, Int3\r\n2 flags)\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogReader..ctor(EventLogQuery eventQuery, EventBookmark bookmark)\r\n   at System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogReader..ctor(EventLogQuery eventQuery)\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetWinEventCommand.ReadEvents(EventLogQuery logQuery)\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetWinEventCommand.ProcessHashQuery()\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetWinEventCommand.ProcessRecord()\r\n   at System.Management.Automation.CommandProcessor.ProcessRecord()\r\nCategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Get-WinEvent], EventLogException\r\nFullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Get\r\nWinEventCommand\r\nInvocationInfo        :\r\n    MyCommand        : Get-WinEvent\r\n    ScriptLineNumber : 1\r\n    OffsetInLine     : 1\r\n    HistoryId        : 13\r\n    Line             : Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{\r\n\r\n    PositionMessage  : At line:1 char:1\r\n                       + Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{\r\n                       + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    InvocationName   : Get-WinEvent\r\n    CommandOrigin    : Internal\r\nScriptStackTrace      : at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n1.\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.22000.282\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.22000.282\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n\r\n2.\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

As SCCM is another MS product I figured you wouldn't mind me opening a bug for this here ;)\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\n$VerbosePreference = \"Continue\" # module or script scope\r\n$someCmApp | Move-CMObject -FolderPath \\blah\\de\\blah -Verbose:$false\r\n# no verbose output desired from SCCM cmdlet\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n# pages of verbose output\r\n# however...\r\n\r\n$VerbosePreference = \"Continue\" # module or script scope\r\n...\r\n# other work where verbose output is desired\r\n...\r\n& {\r\n  $VerbosePreference = \"SilentlyContinue\"\r\n  Move-CMObject ...\r\n  # no Verbose output with the nested script block\r\n}\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

This does not work on PowerShell (tested on 7.2.2)\r\n\r\n`$x = 1; $x++` or `$x = 1; ++$x` do not yield a value\r\n\r\nif I put round brackets around the expression, it works:\r\n`$x = 1; ($x++)` -> 1\r\n`$x = 1; (++$x)` -> 2\r\n\r\nthe operator should yield the respective value without the need to put brackets around it.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> $x = 1; $x++\r\n1\r\n\r\nPS> $x = 1; ++$x\r\n2\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> $x = 1; $x++\r\n<nothing>\r\n\r\nPS> $x = 1; ++$x\r\n<nothing>\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n$ $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

One location where it is used in pwsh is when serializing the client's time zone. On the server end PowerShell has ignored this property since v3 and even on v2 it has an exception handler to ignore invalid values. This means the client can either omit the property altogether or send an empty value and the server will still be fine.\r\n\r\nOne minor difference between a missing property and an empty property value is that `$PSSenderInfo.ClientTimeZone` is `$null` when it's missing and set to `[TimeZone]::Current` when it's an empty value. So to preserve as much existing behaviour an empty value was used instead.\r\n\r\nThe only concern I have with this approach that I haven't tested it with an Exchange endpoint to see if it has any special behaviour with this property.\r\n\r\nPartially addressed https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14054\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.

Also, I do not know a viable method to get the screen scale for other forms other than below, which this problem renders useless.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$vscreen = [System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::VirtualScreen.height\r\n\r\n[xml]$xml = @\"\r\n            <Window\r\n                    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\r\n                    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\">\r\n            </Window>\r\n\"@\r\n$dum = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlNodeReader $xml)\r\n$win = [Windows.Markup.XamlReader]::Load($dum)\r\n\r\n$screen = [System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::VirtualScreen.height\r\n\r\n$global:ctscale = ($screen/$vscreen)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nForms should scale in legacy compatibility, at scale value of 1.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nForms scale at current scale of monitor, similar to WPF, but with control positions skewed.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nI uninstalled this update, needed immediate correction. Can replicate appearance programatically. Before I realized this was update related, I performed a system restore (did not resolve). Had to uninstall Powershell and reinstall to get my system to behave.\n```\n\n\n### OS Data\n\n```powershell\nVersion    Caption\r\n-------    -------\r\n10.0.19043 Microsoft Windows 10 Home\n```\n\n\n### Windows update log\n\n```markdown\nAttached\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n[WindowsUpdate.log](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/8455799/WindowsUpdate.log)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3017980/162546489-00d3f783-3c3a-48f3-b828-f6f6c2e317db.png)\r\n### Bad Behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3017980/162546701-6ca1ebe0-c030-4c49-89f7-aa7714865808.png)\r\n### Good behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3017980/162546816-b9075b4c-6cd6-42b1-bb9f-aba8c8044f31.png)\r\n",

I registered the package source in PS.  When I try to find a package in that source, I'm prompted to use the 'devicelogin' URL with a code.  However, it says \"Selected user account does not exist in tenant\" and I need an external account.  How can I use my existing access to the artifact feed through PS?\r\n\r\n```\r\nRegister-PackageSource -Name \"EdFi\" -Location https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/ed-fi-alliance/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/_packaging/EdFi/nuget/v3/index.json -ProviderName NuGet\r\n\r\nFind-Package EdFi.Suite3.Installer.WebApi -Source EdFi\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nList of available packages that match the ones listed on https://dev.azure.com/ed-fi-alliance/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/_artifacts/feed/EdFi\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n[Minimal] [CredentialProvider]DeviceFlow: https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/ed-fi-alliance/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/_packaging/EdFi/nuget/v3/index.json\r\n[Minimal] [CredentialProvider]ATTENTION: User interaction required.\r\n\r\n    **********************************************************************\r\n\r\n    To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code A8DX6AUAX to authenticate.\r\n\r\n    **********************************************************************\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
