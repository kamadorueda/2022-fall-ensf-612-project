Change all legacy versions to use `Version` instead of `SemanticVersion`, to avoid the overhead of casting when using them for `$PSVersionTable.PSCompatibleVersions`.\r\n3. Simplify the constructor of `ConsoleHostRawUserInterface` to not use `Regex`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/main/reference/7.3/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n",

Partly addresses the currently disable compiler warnings of the CA2213 and CA2215 type.

Trigger the type initializers of `Compiler`, `CachedReflectionInfo`, and `ExpressionCache`, which involves lots of reflection operations.\r\n2. Reverse the order of `LanguagePrimitives` and `TypeAccelerators`, because the former is needed earlier in the startup process.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThe change improves the startup time of `pwsh.exe` by about `30%` on my dev machine.\r\nThe benchmark result below is from comparing \"_a release build with the change (V73Wip)_\" with \"_a release build without the change (V730)_\" (both has R2R images).\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Warm startup -- with module analysis cache pre-populated\r\n## PowerShell is built with 'Release' configuration and R2R images.\r\nTest scenario: pwsh.exe -noprofile -c echo 1\r\n\r\n\r\nBenchmarkDotNet=v0.13.2, OS=Windows 11 (10.0.22621.521)\r\nIntel Xeon W-2235 CPU 3.80GHz, 1 CPU, 12 logical and 6 physical cores\r\n.NET SDK=7.0.100-rc.1.22431.12\r\n  [Host]     : .NET 7.0.0 (7.0.22.42610), X64 RyuJIT AVX2\r\n  DefaultJob : .NET 7.0.0 (7.0.22.42610), X64 RyuJIT AVX2\r\n\r\n\r\n|            Method |     Mean |    Error |   StdDev | Ratio | Code Size |\r\n|------------------ |---------:|---------:|---------:|------:|----------:|\r\n|   V730StartupTime | 557.2 ms | 10.83 ms | 10.64 ms |  1.00 |      41 B |\r\n| V73WipStartupTime | 386.3 ms |  6.81 ms |  6.03 ms |  0.69 |      41 B |\r\n\r\n\r\nBenchmark_pwsh_startup.V730StartupTime: DefaultJob\r\n-------------------- Histogram --------------------\r\n[539.780 ms ; 552.371 ms) | @@@@\r\n[552.371 ms ; 572.428 ms) | @@@@@@@@@@\r\n[572.428 ms ; 584.997 ms) | @@\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBenchmark_pwsh_startup.V73WipStartupTime: DefaultJob\r\n-------------------- Histogram --------------------\r\n[374.236 ms ; 387.432 ms) | @@@@@@@@@\r\n[387.432 ms ; 401.417 ms) | @@@@@\r\n---------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/main/reference/7.3/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n",

Right-align the `User` column, so that `User` and `Group` are closely together.\r\n2. Change the width of `User` and `Group` to be 10 instead of 16. The old limit to username (like in Ubuntu 11.04) was 8 characters, and now the limit is 32 characters. I did a search on _common Linux usernames_, and most of the names I found falls under 10 characters. So, change the width to be 10 instead of 16 to reduce blank spaces of the table view.\r\n3. `LastWriteTime` uses a fixed format for this view, so we can use the exact width, which is 16.\r\n4. For the `Size` column or (length), using width 12 will allow us to show a file size of `931 gb` without truncating, which should be sufficient in most cases.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nBefore the change:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/192885236-fc65fc95-0148-4aef-bb02-b2551579b9a3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the change:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/192885316-a44a390e-4e09-44f2-87e4-19a6fd067cf5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/main/reference/7.3/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n",

So if I am typing a command `fo` and hit `Tab`, autocomplete changes what I typed to `.\\foo.exe`. I can live with that, even though I find it annoying and patronizing.\r\n\r\nThe problem is when `foo.exe` takes command-line arguments, and one of them is the `bar.dat` file. If I'm typing `.\\foo.exe ba` and hit `Tab`, I want to get `.\\foo.exe bar.dat`. I do _not_ want to get `.\\foo.exe .\\bar.dat`. Not only is this irritating as heck (not to mention ugly), it actually breaks some of my commands, which don't allow any directory (even the current directory) to be specified in the argument.\r\n\r\nHow do I turn off this PowerShell quirk of adding a `.\\` to every single autocomplete for a relative path? As far as I'm concerned, I'd like it to be turned off everywhere—I can remember to type `.\\foo.exe` instead of `foo.exe` for the initial command. As I mentioned earlier, I can partially understand that PowerShell wants to add the `.\\` to the initial command, because it's required to run a program in the current directory. But I'm dumbfounded as to why PowerShell is so unintelligent that it blindly adds the `.\\` prefix to all relative paths, even where it's not required, not needed, and certainly not desired.\r\n\r\nI opened [prevent PowerShell autocomplete from adding dot prefix](https://superuser.com/questions/1741125/prevent-powershell-autocomplete-from-adding-dot-prefix) on Super User, but no one had any solutions.\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_",

On Stack Overflow, one can find guides how to do that, but at least some of them are either wrong, or grossly inefficient (e.g. spawning a new `PowerShell` instance just to run a single cmdlet).\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate an official documentation on how to invoke `PSCmdlet`-deriving cmdlets, and ideally a new, discoverable, type-safe method on `PSCmdlet` to do that without extra workarounds.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

Yet, currently, it is required to setup a loop for this, similar to e.g.:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfor ($i = 0, $i -lt $Test.Length; $i++) { $_[$i] }\r\n```\r\nOr transform everything into a character array:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$LongString.ToCharArray()\r\n```\r\nWhich would be quiet expensive, if I would like to do something like this:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$LongString.where({ $_ -ne $Char }, 'First').foreach{ ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA lot of use cases for this request might of cause also achieved with regular expressions, but regular expressions are not PowerShell and therefore more cryptic and limited to a certain complexity.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

For example, now we have `string.Split(char)` and can use it instead of `string.Split(char[])`.\r\nI had to refactor some methods.\r\n- `Escape()` method now is more short, simple, clear and fast - now we exactly point chars we want to escape.\r\n- GetModuleNameAndVersion() method is refactored a bit. Since all paths have been collected from file system it makes no sense to take into account alternative directory separator.\r\n- PathSearchTrimEnd is removed based on https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/76122#issuecomment-1256977256\r\n(for ex., now we don't remove trail spaces that are valid in file names)\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [ ] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/main/reference/7.3/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.

PSCustomObject\r\n{\r\n  Obj =\r\n    class PSCustomObject\r\n    {\r\n      Time = 2022-09-21 09:38:35\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that\r\n```powershell\r\n[pscustomobject]@{Time = [datetime]::now} | format-custom\r\n```\r\nwould output \r\n```text\r\nclass PSCustomObject\r\n{\r\n    Time = 2022-09-21 09:38:35\r\n}\r\n```\r\nMaybe use `-Force` to get the full recursive version?\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Draft 4 is a decade old at this point and the JSON Schema team (myself included) is encouraging tooling to only support draft 6/7 (6 is a subset of 7) and later.

Using `Start-Job` results in a failed job. The problem is that ~/.dotnet/tools/.store/powershell/7.2.6/powershell/7.2.6/tools/net6.0/any/unix/pwsh is a Linux ELF executable, not Mach-O. If I move ~/.dotnet/tools/.store/powershell/7.2.6/powershell/7.2.6/tools/net6.0/any/unix/pwsh out of the way and replace it with a symlink to ~/.dotnet/tools/pwsh, then `Start-Job` works as expected.\r\n\r\nI noticed that ~/.dotnet/tools/.store/powershell/7.2.6/powershell/7.2.6/tools/net6.0/any/unix gets prepended to `$Env:PATH` when `pwsh` starts up, so the `pwsh` in that location is the first one found in a path search. I tried altering my path to remove that directory, but `Start-Job` still uses the `pwsh` in that location. Only replacing the ELF binary with a link to the Mach-O binary fixes the problem, although I don't know if this might result in other issues (I haven't run into any yet).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> Start-Job -ScriptBlock {}\r\nId  Name  PSJobTypeName  State    HasMoreData  Location   Command\r\n--  ----  -------------  -----    -----------  --------   -------\r\n1   Job1  BackgroundJob  Running  True         localhost\r\n\r\nPS> Get-Job\r\nId  Name  PSJobTypeName  State      HasMoreData  Location   Command\r\n--  ----  -------------  -----      -----------  --------   -------\r\n1   Job1  BackgroundJob  Completed  False        localhost\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> Start-Job -ScriptBlock {}\r\nId  Name  PSJobTypeName  State   HasMoreData  Location   Command\r\n--  ----  -------------  -----   -----------  --------   -------\r\n1   Job1  BackgroundJob  Failed  False        localhost  \r\n\r\nPS> Receive-Job 1\r\nOpenError: [localhost] An error occurred while starting the background process.

This makes it not work in a parallel workflow, such as `ForEach-Object -Parallel` -- method invocations on the class would be marshalled back to the Runspace it was created, which could cause corruption to the state of that Runsapce or a deadlock. See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4003 and https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3651 for examples.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, if the attribute `NoRunspaceAffinity` is declared for a PowerShell class, then the PowerShell class will not be affiliated with a particular Runspace/SessionState, and its method invocation (both instance and static) will use the default Runspace of the running thread and its current session state.\r\n\r\nOf course, once declaring the attribute to the class, the class implementation should not depend on any states of a particular session state, because there is no guarantee the dependencies would be available at runtime.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/main/reference/7.3/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/9231\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n",

Since StrictMode versions are opt-in, this is not a breaking change. I believe this to be a perfect solution, as user simply has to add parentheses to make it explicit what order they expect:\r\n```pwsh\r\n> 1 -or 1 -and 0\r\nError\r\n> 1 -or (1 -and 0)  # expected behavior\r\n1\r\n> (1 -or 1) -and 0  # current behavior\r\n0\r\n> 0 -and 1 -or 1  # no parentheses required, as both behaviors produce same result\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nFull **list of which combination of operators in what order should emit the error is to be determined**, but can be gathered from older issues and https://github.com/nightroman/PowerShellTraps\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nImplementation should have as little performance impact as possible. I hope that simple pattern matching on the AST should be enough, e.g. `and/or` confusion should be detectable by checking for the pattern `x -or y -and z` (`x -and y -or z` is not an issue, as it always executes `and` first, both in PowerShell's same-precendence and other languages' and-before-or).\r\n\r\nIf possible, it should be done at parsing stage, to also detect code in not-taken branches.",

I have the following line in $PROFILE:\r\n`Set-PSReadLineOption -PredictionSource History`\r\n \r\nWhen I use `scp` from other computer to this one, it always shows warning:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59761962/191028660-6bd4ae69-bf14-412f-bb99-442a462bcfc9.png)\r\n\r\nI suppose openSSH Server always load the whole profile in both `ssh` and `scp`. I want to keep this setting in `ssh` connection, but not to load it in `scp`. I tried using `[Environment]::UserInteractive` variable, but it cannot tell `ssh` from `scp` (value is False for both).\r\n\r\nSo is there a proper command to test whether pwsh.exe is run in scp? (like `[[ $- == *i* ]]` in Linux)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nDisable some profile lines in `scp`.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nAlways load the whole profile in `scp`.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

If OpenSSHD is not already present, install it (e.g. on Windows run `Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name  OpenSSH.Server~~~~0.0.1.0`) \r\n2. Enable Remote sessions over ssh by editing the sshd config file as described in https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core?view=powershell-7.2  (on Windows copy `C:\\Windows\\System32\\OpenSSH\\sshd_config_default`  to  `C:\\ProgramData\\ssh\\sshd_config` to give yourself a file to start from)\r\n3. Backup your profile.ps1 if you have one, and create a simple `profile.ps1`  e.g. ` 'hello' `\r\n4. run `new-PSSession  -HostName localhost`\r\n5. Observe the error `New-PSSession: [localhost] There is an error processing data from the background process. Error reported: Hello.` \r\n6. Think \"A-ha I need to use -NoProfile so SSH works like WinRM\", modify the config file, restart the sshd Service, try again, curse when the same error occurs\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS>  new-PSSession  -HostName localhost\r\nxxxx@localhost's password:\r\n\r\n Id Name            Transport ComputerName    ComputerType    State         ConfigurationName     Availability\r\n -- ----            --------- ------------    ------------    -----         -----------------     ------------\r\n  5 Runspace4       SSH       localhost       RemoteMachine   Opened        DefaultShell             Available\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS>  new-PSSession  -HostName localhost\r\nxxxx@localhost's password:\r\nNew-PSSession: [localhost] There is an error processing data from the background process.

(Even then, the debugger/pwsh executable crashing isn't ideal.)\r\n\r\nStoring `ssh` output into a variable and piping that variable into the cmdlet with breakpoints works normally. Perhaps `ssh` is preventing the debugger from calling ReadKey()?\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS> pushd $HOME\\source\\repos\r\nPS> ipmo .\\ConvertFrom-RegEx\\ConvertFrom-RegEx # repo hmmwhatsthisdo/ConvertFrom-RegEx, commit f18a0a46\r\nPS> Set-PSBreakpoint -Script .\\ConvertFrom-RegEx\\ConvertFrom-RegEx\\Public\\ConvertFrom-RegEx.ps1 -Line 135 \r\nPS> ssh $remoteuser@$remoteip -i $HOME\\.ssh\\$remoteuser-id_rsa cat /var/log/syslog | ConvertFrom-RegEx -Pattern '^(?<month>\\S+)'\r\n# [PowerShell hits debugger breakpoint]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nDebugger crashes upon hitting breakpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nAn error has occurred that was not properly handled.

    "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\n`Set-Clipboard` does not really work over SSH, as it always sets the clipboard of the target machine, not the host. This means that if you SSH e.g. from your PC to a server, then `Set-Clipboard` will set the server's clipboard, not your PCs, so you cannot paste it anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis can be resolved by using ANSI escape sequence (same mechanism as for setting colors) [OSC52](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html#h3-Operating-System-Commands:~:text=Ps%20%3D%205%202%20%20%E2%87%92%C2%A0%20Manipulate%20Selection%20Data), which sets the clipboard of the host machine, which in our example is the PC, so you can paste it anywhere. This sequence is supported by most terminals, including [Microsoft Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/2946).\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n```pwsh\r\nfunction Set-RemoteClipboard($text) {\r\n    Write-Host \"`e]52;;$([System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($text)))`a\"\r\n}\r\n# Copy \"original\" into a clipboard from anywhere\r\n> Set-Clipboard 'changed'\r\n# Press Ctrl+Shift+V to see clipboard still \"original\"\r\n> Set-RemoteClipboard 'changed'\r\n# Press Ctrl+Shift+V to see clipboard now \"changed\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOSC also has similar `Get-Clipboard -Remote` sequence, but no terminal implements it as it is rightly considered a security and privacy risk, and you ca simply \"get\" the host clipboard with Ctrl+Shift+V.\r\n\r\nOpens:\r\n1. Should we autodetect when to use the OSC52 instead of xclip or other OS target-implementation? E.g. SSH can be detected by presence of environment variables `$env:SSH_CLIENT` and `$env:SSH_TTY`. I would say no, as it could be potentially breaking behavior in case of false positives on terminals which don't support the OSC. If user wants such behavior, they can add `$PSDefaultParameters['Set-Clipboard:Remote'] = $env:SSH_CLIENT -or $env:SSH_TTY` to their `$PROFILE`.\r\n2. Some terminal multiplexers like screen and tmux may require wrapping OSC52 into a different escape, as can be seen in the [vim plugin implementation](https://github.com/ojroques/vim-oscyank/blob/main/plugin/oscyank.vim). Should we detect and handle those cases? tmux can be forced to work with default escape by setting `set -s set-clipboard on`. I would say keep it simple for now, then maybe add `-RemoteMethod = auto | osc52 | tmux | screen` in separate issue if required.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nSee example for the escape sequence format.",
