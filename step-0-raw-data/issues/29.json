    "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a trusted community module maintainer, I would like a wealth of information shouted from the rooftops about how to prevent PowerShell scripts from being reported as a trojan by Windows Defender. Recently, a file that has not changed in 2 years was reported as a Trojan to two of our users.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8278033/118113836-14a35d80-b3e7-11eb-85ff-5cfecc670245.png)\r\n\r\nWhile our file is not a trojan, false positives from Windows Defender impact the trustworthiness of our module. We've worked hard over the years to engender trust in both dbatools and PowerShell. Currently, I hold up our CI/CD process to review each commit to ensure it is not malicious before I publish it to the PowerShell Gallery.\r\n\r\nIs there a solution for whitelisting trusted community modules and adding a feature to PSScriptAnalyzer that highlights problematic techniques?\r\n\r\nSo far, one user has confirmed that the signed version from the PowerShell Gallery is not triggering AV. The problem with this is that:\r\n\r\n1. Not all PowerShell Developers can afford Code Signing Certificates\r\n2. Not everyone uses the PowerShell Gallery and we'd like to continue offering installs via GitHub. Our code cannot be signed and saved to the repository.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this may be a result of some enhancements to [AMSI and machine learning](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/08/27/stopping-active-directory-attacks-and-other-post-exploitation-behavior-with-amsi-and-machine-learning/)\r\n\r\n> Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) helps security software to detect such malicious scripts by exposing script content and behavior. AMSI integrates with scripting engines on Windows 10 as well as Office 365 VBA to provide insights into the execution of PowerShell, WMI, VBScript, JavaScript, and Office VBA macros. \r\n\r\n(I hope IronPython is impacted as well 😅)\r\n\r\nHere's information about the Defender definition that alerted the user\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8278033/118118685-8bdbf000-b3ed-11eb-94f2-d73681a7f79d.png)\r\n\r\nI assume that `[Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom($assemblyPath)`, which we use to make imports as fast as possible, is the problematic technique, but I can't find any confirmation. Other blogs talk about using that for loading from memory but we are loading from disk. Once we get this issue solved, however, I'd like to know what to modify in other files. Perhaps the Gallery can detect these techniques and email module owners.\r\n\r\nOther PowerShell users are experiencing this a well as noted in the following links:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/JustinWGrote/status/1392518022900850688\r\nhttps://twitter.com/psCookieMonster/status/1392796401545981953\r\nhttps://twitter.com/DrAzureAD/status/1361298815815417856\r\nhttps://twitter.com/PrzemyslawKlys/status/1392933835978027019\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/3017\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/jj4wzw/removing_trojanpowershellmountsiaml_trigger_from/\r\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/defender-detected-powershell-ise-exe-as-trojan-powershell/m-p/2180534\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421190712/https://getimageview.net/2020/06/02/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-is-hurting-independent-developers/) suggests that the file being unsigned is the problem, and a commenter said that \"Cleared it up by submitting it to Microsoft’s service at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission.\" Do we make it part of our GitHub pipeline to submit changed files to that site?\r\n\r\nEdit: I know that the PowerShell team is not the Defender team,  but considering unsigned PowerShell files in a git repository (it's impossible to sign and commit, I've tried, it changes the SHA) trigger AV warnings, this may be a very big problem for PowerShell development and scripting in general. Taking a look at [Warren](https://twitter.com/psCookieMonster/status/1392796401545981953)'s code, which has been flagged by Defender, nothing stands out.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Pester wasn't mocking git... \r\n# Borrowed idea from https://github.com/pester/Pester/issues/415\r\nfunction Invoke-ExternalCommand {\r\n    [cmdletbinding()]\r\n    param($Command, [string[]]$Arguments, [switch]$Passthru)\r\n\r\n    Write-Verbose \"Running $Command with arguments $($Arguments -join \"; \")\"\r\n    $result = $null\r\n    $result = & $command @arguments  \r\n    Write-Verbose \"$($result | Out-String)\"\r\n    if($Passthru)\r\n    {\r\n        $Result\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````",

The parameters are defined in the base class but implemented in the cmdlet class. `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` implements the **SourcePathOrExtension** and **Content** parameters, but `Set-AuthenticodeSignature` does not.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `Get-Command` shows that parameters even though they are not implemented, causing confusion to the users and in the documentation.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\nWe have update the docs to explain that the parameters are not implemented. \r\n\r\nThe code should be changed. The parameters should be moved out of the base class and into the cmdlet class `GetAuthenticodeSignatureCommand`. That way, the parameters only apply to that cmdlet.\r\n\r\nSee related Docs issue https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/7564.\r\n",

This was mandatory to be able to target multiple TFMs.\r\n* specify all package references in explicit way. It seems to be some kind of SDK/MSBuild limitation. If the project references project `A` which references project `B` and we want to reference their **packages** for different TFMs, we have to explicitly reference package `A` **and** `B`. Referencing just `A` gives errors about missing `B`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n\r\n@daxian-dbw @adityapatwardhan PTAL",

Also, it seems that the console host is calling Win32 APIs instead of the .NET APIs and I don't see any specific reason to do that other than consistency with other native APIs that need to be used.\r\n\r\nFix is to switch to using Console.SetCursorPosition and remove all use of the Win32 API.  Catch the ArgumentOutOfRangeException and ignore it.  There is really no way to avoid the race condition here as any validation of the screen buffer size can be wrong by the time we set the cursor position.  The user may have resized the window or when tabs show up on Windows Terminal, the screen buffer size automatically shrinks so that the window size doesn't change.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/15254\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.

    "body": "When you call the PowerShell CLI with `-OutputFormat xml` / `-of xml` _explicitly_, the formatting system renders the raw CLIXML output instead of deserializing the CLIXML first and then applying the output formatting to the deserialized objects.\r\n\r\n(Note that `-OutputFormat xml` is used _implicitly_ when you pass a _script block_ to the `-Command` / `-c` parameter, but the problem doesn't surface then, possibly due to taking a different code path behind the scenes, given that the script block is translated into a Base64-encoded `-EncodedCommand` argument.)\r\n\r\nNote that only the _output formatting system_ is affected and only when printing _to the console_; if you _capture or redirect_ the output, deserialization happens normally. Therefore, the simplest workaround is to enclose the CLI call in `(...)`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Note: To work around the bug, enclose the call in (...)\r\npwsh -OutputFormat xml -noprofile -c 'Get-Item $PROFILE'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe usual, formatted output, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n    Directory: /Users/jdoe/.config/powershell\r\n\r\nUnixMode   User             Group                 LastWriteTime           Size Name\r\n--------   ----             -----                 -------------

prints.\r\n\r\n```none\r\n#< CLIXML\r\n<Objs Version=\"1.1.0.1\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04\"><Obj S=\"Output\" RefId=\"0\"><TN

I'm not sure if this could be easily accomplished natively in PowerShell without more complicated and/or lengthy code.\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting similar functionality be added to the `-replace` operator so this could be done natively in PowerShell without resorting to .Net.\r\n\r\n`$String -replace $Pattern, \"Two\", 1`\r\n\r\nThis syntax would be similar to `-split` \\<Max-substrings\\> parameter. Moreover, it shouldn't be a breaking change. Since the new optional argument would tail after the existing 2 arguments, existing scripts shouldn't be affected.\r\n\r\nAlso similar to \\<Max-substrings\\> a negative argument can instruct to replace the last X occurrences rather than the first.\r\n\r\n`$String -replace $Pattern, \"Two\", -1`\r\n\r\n**Output:**\r\n\r\n`\"One, One, Two\"`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Today, we collect all the log strings in a buffer, and if the group policy `EnableModuleLogging` is enabled, strings from that buffer will be concatenated and used as the payload for writing out a pipeline execution-details event.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, in most cases, the group policy `EnableModuleLogging` is NOT enabled, and we are just collecting a lot logging strings in a buffer list in vain.

In all variations, only a one line short description is shown.\r\n\r\nThe one line description is taken from `whatis(1)` output is exact match is available and from `apropos(1)` output when general match is available.  Both commands are used, as their MacOs version does not support options.\r\n\r\nWhen a list of matched command names is shown, the output format is similar to [this suggestion](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/702#issuecomment-225665241), with `Manpage` as Category (`Linux` may be more appropriate, but manpage may be shown in other OSs), and the short description as Synopsis.\r\n\r\nOnly manpages of sections 1,6,8 are used, as these are manpages of executable.  Assumption is that manpages of library routines, etc. should not be shown. (The user can still used the `man` command to see the full list.)\r\n\r\nWhen only one command is found, and it is from a manpage, the output is shown below for `whatis` and is used for all cases (short, full, example, etc.):\r\n```\r\nNAME\r\n    whatis (1)\r\n\r\nSHORT DESCRIPTION\r\n    display one-line manual page descriptions\r\n\r\nREMARKS\r\n    For full help use `man whatis`\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Output Examples\r\n- **pwd**: `help pwd` shows the PS help for `pwd` alias, `help pwd*` output is:\r\n```\r\nName                              Category  Module

Given how mutable objects can be in powershell, this makes working in strict mode more frustrating than it needs to be.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nCurrently the only real way to check this is with the somewhat obscure `$object.PSObject.Properties.Name -contains $propName` -- an operator should be provided that checks whether the property exists in a similar way (can we be more thorough than this? Should we?) and safely returns a null or false so that these expressions are easier to write.\r\n\r\nTemporarily borrowing the `?.` operator for now (we don't _have_ to use this operator, but at least to me it sort of makes sense here), it would look something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$value = if ($myObj?.Property) {\r\n    $myObj.Property\r\n}\r\nelse {\r\n    $safeDefault\r\n}\r\n\r\n# nice and neat if we use null coalescing too\r\n\r\n$value = $myObject?.Property ?? $safeDefault\r\n```\r\n",

Why?\r\n\r\nSo to make it harder, I am using MDT to mass deploy images and as such, I can not install RSAT on every workstation to get the AD powershell module installed in Powershell. Can anyone please recommend a method to prevent my imaging to pop existing PCs in AD using MDT or if there is a way to tell the function to not change existing PCs?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "**Issue:**\r\nOn an Azure AD joined device, when running commands such as get-ADUser or get-ADGroup the initial query is very fast.  However, when storing the results in a variable and attempting to view them the domain controller is contacted for each and every single result, causing massive delays for processing records.\r\n\r\nThis does not occur on a standard domain joined device.  Both devices are on the same physical wired network within the organization.\r\n\r\nWith the initial query ran and results cached, if the network adapter is disabled traversing the results happens instantly as would be expected.  When viewing the difference between those records returned with a live network and those without the results returned with a live network have five additional blank attributes:\r\n\r\n- WriteDebugStream\r\n- WriteErrorStream\r\n- WriteInformationStream\r\n- WriteVerboseStream\r\n- WriteWarningStream\r\n\r\nNot sure why traversing the records would cause additional network activity and what these fields are to represent.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nThe code should operate the same whether using a domain joined device or an Azure AD joined device.\r\n\r\n**How to Replicate:**\r\nRunning the following code on a domain joined PC works fine.

It surprised me that ``Append`` did not append my definition to the existing one.\r\nDo I need to structure my XML differently, or is there something missing in the XSD that allows inheritance? e.g. something like:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n...\r\n<ListItems>\r\n  <Inherit />\r\n    <ListItem>\r\n      ...\r\n    </ListItem>\r\n</ListItems>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsage Scenarios:\r\n\r\n1. I don't want to have to replace/re-apply any changes to the default formats when powershell is updated.\r\n2. I want to benefit from multiple modules extending/altering views e.g [with colors/icons](https://github.com/devblackops/Terminal-Icons), [better length values](https://github.com/dfinke/PowerShellHumanizer) etc. It seems impossible to use both modules at once because one will overwrite the format of the other. Currently, it seems only manually merging the formats is possible.\r\n\r\n",

I looked around but maybe my search terms are not ok, I couldn't find a related issue.\r\n\r\nFor example: these keep running the upstream command even after the downstream command closes; (the `cmd /c '@echo off'` command is just to mimick an external program which consumes the pipe then stops without output before all items are consumed - a real example would be a program like [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)):\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -Rec -Fo -File | more\r\nls -Rec -Fo -File | cmd /c '@echo off'\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis can be worked around with Select-Object to force a `StopUpstreamCommandsException`, e.g. this works as expected in that the pipe stops:\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -Rec -Fo -File | & \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\head.exe\" | Select-Object -First 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nhowever that's only ok because it is known `head` will by default produce 10 items. That's a problem because it means piping into a command which produces no output will not stop the pipe when that command exits. So this still keeps on running:\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -Rec -Fo -File | cmd /c '@echo off' | Select-Object -First 1 | Out-Null\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne workaround is be to launch the external program with the .net Process API, then use `Register-ObjectEvent -EventName 'Exited'` and then throw a `StopUpstreamCommandsException` using a technique like https://stackoverflow.com/a/34800670. But that's non-trivial.\r\n\r\nAnother simpler one would be to make the external command always produce output no matter what. I hoped pipeline chain operators could do that but due to associativity that doesn't cut it. That is to say, I assume that\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -Rec -Fo -File | cmd /c '@echo off' || 'TERMINATOR' | Select-Object -First 1 | Out-Null\r\n```\r\ndoesn't stop right away because it comes down to\r\n```\r\n(ls -Rec -Fo -File | cmd /c '@echo off') || 'TERMINATOR' | Select-Object -First 1 | Out-Null\r\n```\r\nand not\r\n```\r\nls -Rec -Fo -File | (cmd /c '@echo off' || 'TERMINATOR') | Select-Object -First 1 | Out-Null\r\n```\r\n(which yields a ParserError).\r\n\r\nThe idea to always have the external command produce output can be done in cmd like\r\n```\r\nls -Rec -Fo -File | cmd /c '(@echo off || echo TERMINATOR) && echo TERMINATOR' | Select-Object -First 1 | Out-Null\r\n```\r\ni.e. no matter if the external program (as said mimicked by `@echo off`) produces output or not, the echos after it make sure it does. Is there another workaround? ",

Issue #15229.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nIn the early days .NET stream reader/writer did not correctly handle std streams on Windows plaforms only, and we had a PInvoke workaround.  This workaround is no longer needed and can be removed.  This change also disables the ability for Console APIs to write to stdout, which is reserved for PSRP messages only.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.

    "body": "Based on my own observations, it would appear that in PowerShell 5.1 the order in which `Get-ChildItem` lists files is governed by the file system, which is in accordance with [this article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140304-00/?p=1603) by Raymond Chen where he explains how the command prompt's DIR command lists files when no explicit sorting is specified.\r\n\r\nWhereas in PowerShell Core, `Get-ChildItem` appears to list files using case-insensitive lexicographical sorting irrespective of the underlying file system.\r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n  * Can someone point to the code that's responsible for producing case-insensitive lexicographical sorting? I'm not sure if this behaviour is due to coding within PowerShell or if it's just the result of behaviour exhibited by something within .Net core.\r\n  * Is this behaviour now considered contractual or is it liable to change? If contractual then should it be documented?\r\n  * There are certainly benefits to having a standardised file listing order however the case-insensitive aspect of it is somewhat contrary to expectation on GNU/Linux. Should `Get-ChildItem` provide a means of respecting case on GNU/Linux?\r\n\r\nBelow are details of my observations...\r\n\r\n# NTFS File System\r\n\r\nExcerpt from Raymond Chen's [article](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140304-00/?p=1603): _\"The NTFS file system internally maintains directory entries in a B-tree structure, which means that the most convenient way of enumerating the directory contents is in B-tree order...\"_\r\n\r\nHaving done some further research, the B-tree that Raymond alludes to is organised lexicographically.\r\n\r\n## Test Performed\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Create five files that adhere to the format `foo_<YYYYMMDD>.txt`, one of which\r\n# is uppercase.\r\n\r\nNew-Item -Path \"C:\\TestFiles\" -ItemType Directory\r\n\"Hello\" > \"C:\\TestFiles\\foo_20210304.txt\"\r\n\"Hello\" > \"C:\\TestFiles\\foo_20210301.txt\"\r\n\"Hello\" > \"C:\\TestFiles\\FOO_20210303.txt\"\r\n\"Hello\" > \"C:\\TestFiles\\foo_20210302.txt\"\r\n\"Hello\" > \"C:\\TestFiles\\foo_20210305.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Result: Windows PowerShell 5.1 on Windows 10\r\n\r\nFiles are listed in case-insensitive lexicographical order.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\> Get-ChildItem \"C:\\TestFiles\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\TestFiles\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----

the order in which files are created and deleted and the lengths of their names.\"_\r\n\r\n## Test Performed\r\n\r\nI connected a FAT32 formatted USB thumb drive to a computer running Windows 10 where it was mounted as `D:\\` drive.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Create five files that adhere to the format `foo_<YYYYMMDD>.txt`, one of which\r\n# is uppercase.\r\n\r\nNew-Item -Path \"D:\\TestFiles\" -ItemType

When I look at the ast the problem appears to be that the whole script is surrounded by an implicit end block unless you explicitly add a begin/process/end block and this causes the \"lastAst\" https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandCompletion/CompletionAnalysis.cs#L395 to be a NamedBlockAst instead of an AttributeAst or whatever the various completions expect.\r\n\r\nAn easy fix that doesn't appear to break anything is to remove the NamedBlockAst from the list if it happens to be the last item in the \"RelatedAsts\" list but is there a better way?

We recently had to force it to be called by Windows Powershell due to 7.1 seemingly removing ability to load the Appx module.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module Appx\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nSuccess, no output/error printed at all.

However, [Dispose() only closes the redirected streams](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/51594#issuecomment-823648869) and thus has different behavior on Windows, Linux, and macOS.  On Linux, it appears that the processes will be killed by the OS.  However, on macOS, the process continues to run in the background.  On Windows, because of the difference of exe vs winexe (graphical apps), we can't forcibly kill the process as starting `notepad` would be killed instantly so we leave it as Dispose().\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.

This isn't possible in general though, since we must know which parameters are switch parameters on the script to do this correctly.\r\n\r\nSo then we're forced to use `AddScript` and use some string templating:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n$\"& '{scriptPath.Replace(\"'\", \"''\")}' {string.Join(\" \", args)}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has some serious drawbacks:\r\n\r\n- Injection becomes a possibility\r\n- Some arguments need escaping and others don't. Parameters shouldn't be escaped, but we don't actually know what's a parameter or not (that's what parameter binding works out).\r\n- The actual command execution stack now has an extra script layer in it, which isn't a nice artefact when debugging\r\n\r\nIs there a better way? It would be nice if we could effectively array-splat from .NET.",

    "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n* `ConvertFrom-Json`'s behavior was changed in v7.0 so as not to contravene the fundamental expectation that arrays are _enumerated_ in the pipeline - even though that change constituted a breaking one. A `-NoEnumerate` switch was added as an opt-in to the old, non-enumerating behavior (array being sent as a whole, as a _single object_ through the pipeline).\r\n  * For the original discussion, see #3424.\r\n\r\n* By contrast, `Invoke-RestMethod`, which has `ConvertFrom-Json` built in, in a manner of speaking, still exhibits the old, non-enumerating behavior, which leads to surprising behavior, especially with `ForEach-Object` and `Where-Object` - see #15272, for example.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest we change `Invoke-RestMethod` to follow `ConvertFrom-Json`'s new behavior:\r\n\r\n* Array-valued results should be _enumerated by default_.\r\n\r\n* A new `-NoEnumerate` switch would provide an opt-in to the old, non-enumerating behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I would expect pwsh on macOS/Linux to behave the same.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\npwsh 7.1.3 on macOS and Linux\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[IO.DirectoryInfo]::new('doesnotexist') | Format-List\r\n[IO.FileInfo]::new('doesnotexist') | Format-List\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\npwsh 7.1.3 on Windows 10\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> [IO.DirectoryInfo]::new('doesnotexist') | Format-List\r\n\r\nName           : doesnotexist\r\nCreationTime   : 12/31/1600 4:00:00 PM\r\nLastWriteTime  : 12/31/1600 4:00:00 PM\r\nLastAccessTime : 12/31/1600 4:00:00 PM\r\nMode           : larhs\r\nLinkType       :\r\nTarget         : doesnotexist\r\n\r\n> [IO.FileInfo]::new('doesnotexist') | Format-List\r\n\r\nName           : doesnotexist\r\nLength         :\r\nCreationTime   : 12/31/1600 4:00:00 PM\r\nLastWriteTime  : 12/31/1600 4:00:00 PM\r\nLastAccessTime : 12/31/1600 4:00:00 PM\r\nMode           : larhs\r\nLinkType       :\r\nTarget         : doesnotexist\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nOn macOS and Linux, the `LinkType` property has a value of `SymbolicLink`, even though the directory/file does not exist.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> [IO.DirectoryInfo]::new('doesnotexist') | Format-List\r\n\r\nName           : doesnotexist\r\nCreationTime   : 12/31/1600 16:07:00\r\nLastWriteTime  : 12/31/1600 16:07:00\r\nLastAccessTime : 12/31/1600 16:07:00\r\nMode           : larhs\r\nLinkType       : SymbolicLink\r\nTarget         : doesnotexist\r\n\r\n> [IO.FileInfo]::new('doesnotexist') | Format-List\r\n\r\nName           : doesnotexist\r\nLength         :\r\nCreationTime   : 12/31/1600 16:07:00\r\nLastWriteTime  : 12/31/1600 16:07:00\r\nLastAccessTime : 12/31/1600 16:07:00\r\nMode           : larhs\r\nLinkType       : SymbolicLink\r\nTarget         : doesnotexist\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\nWSL\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Linux 5.4.72-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Wed Oct 28 23:40:43 UTC 2020\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWindows 10\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0…}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "I’m trying to consume the [Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK/), because I want to host the PowerShell runtime in my app. But the resulting file layout does not quite work in my situation.\r\n\r\nImportantly (for this Issue), my app is built as a \"Self-Contained Deployment\" (SCD) (as opposed to a \"Framework-Dependent Deployment\" (FDD)). And targeting Windows only (RID of `win10-x64`).\r\n\r\nWhen I build my VS solution, I end up with these files in my output directory:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nC:\\SRC\\TMP_DBGSHELL2\\BIN\\DEBUG\\X64\\RUNTIMES\r\n├───unix\r\n│   └───lib\r\n│       └───net5.0\r\n│           └───Modules\r\n│               ├───Microsoft.PowerShell.Host\r\n│               ├───Microsoft.PowerShell.Management\r\n│               ├───Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\r\n│               └───Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\r\n└───win\r\n    └───lib\r\n        └───net5.0\r\n            └───Modules\r\n                ├───CimCmdlets\r\n                ├───Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics\r\n                ├───Microsoft.PowerShell.Host\r\n                ├───Microsoft.PowerShell.Management\r\n                ├───Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\r\n                ├───Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\r\n                ├───Microsoft.WSMan.Management\r\n                └───PSDiagnostics\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe “unix” directory is definitely not needed at all—my sole TFM is “net5.0-windows” and my `<TargetPlatformIdentifier>` is Windows; my RID is win10-x64… so I don’t want anything n*x-related in my output.\r\n\r\nBut worse: the win “Modules” directory IS actually needed, but it is in the wrong place to be found at runtime--it should be in the root output directory (next to S.M.A.dll, else S.M.A.dll can’t find it).\r\n\r\n# Repro steps\r\n\r\n1. Create a default .NET “Hello world” console app. (Using VS 2019; .NET 5.0)\r\na. Fixed up the Platform to be x64 if you like\r\n2. Make the app an SCD by adding the following lines to the .csproj:\r\n```xml\r\n  <PropertyGroup Condition=\"'$(Platform)'=='x64'\">\r\n    <RuntimeIdentifier>win10-x64</RuntimeIdentifier>\r\n    <SelfContained>true</SelfContained>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Add a reference to the PowerShell SDK by adding these lines to the .csproj:\r\n```xml\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK\" Version=\"7.1.3\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n4. Add some code to the Main function to run “`ipmo PSDiagnostics -PassThru | fl`” to load the PSDiagnostics module, and then (crucially) show where the module is being loaded from. Something like:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Management.Automation;\r\n\r\nnamespace ReproPowerShellSdkPackageProblem\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\r\n\r\n            PowerShell shell = PowerShell.Create();\r\n\r\n            shell.AddCommand(\"Set-ExecutionPolicy\")\r\n                 .AddParameter(\"ExecutionPolicy\", \"Bypass\")\r\n                 .AddParameter(\"Force\", true)\r\n                 .AddStatement();\r\n\r\n            shell.AddCommand(\"Import-Module\")\r\n                 .AddParameter(\"Name\", @\"PSDiagnostics\")\r\n                 .AddParameter(\"PassThru\", true)\r\n                 .AddCommand(\"Format-List\")\r\n                 .AddCommand(\"Out-String\");\r\n\r\n            var results = shell.Invoke();\r\n            foreach (var result in results)\r\n            {\r\n                Console.WriteLine(\"result: {0}\", result);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Notice the output: it will say that it got imported from some wacky place\r\n            // which I think is an indication that it was imported from (legacy) Windows\r\n            // PowerShell (5.1)--something like\r\n            //\r\n            //      \"~\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\remoteIpMoProxy_PSDiagnostics_1.0.0.0_localhost_9c08982f-951c-4119-9325-80631e83bf5a\\remoteIpMoProxy_PSDiagnostics_1.0.0.0_localhost_9c08982f-951c-4119-9325-80631e83bf5a.psm1\"\r\n            //\r\n            // But if you go to the bin dir and manually move the \"Modules\" folder from\r\n            // \"runtimes\\win\\lib\\net5.0\", up next to the EXE (and S.M.A.dll), and then\r\n            // re-run, you will get the expected result: PSDiagnostics loaded from the\r\n            // Modules directory you just placed in the bin dir.\r\n\r\n            Console.WriteLine(\"[enter] to exit\");\r\n            Console.ReadLine();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected results:\r\nNo \"unix\" stuff in my output dir. My app should be able to load and use the PSDiagnostics module (and other modules) that were included as part of the SDK.\r\n\r\n## Actual results:\r\nWhen you build and then run the EXE, it shows that PSDiagnostics is getting loaded from some strange location (in my case: \"`~\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\remoteIpMoProxy_PSDiagnostics_1.0.0.0_localhost_9c08982f-951c-4119-9325-80631e83bf5a\\remoteIpMoProxy_PSDiagnostics_1.0.0.0_localhost_9c08982f-951c-4119-9325-80631e83bf5a.psm1`\")\r\n\r\nBut if you manually move the “Modules” directory to be next to the EXE (and S.M.A.dll), then re-run it, it will correctly load the PSDiagnostics module from the Modules folder.\r\n\r\nIt really does make a difference that I’m making my app an SCD—if I get rid of that (just deleting that part in the .csproj, thus making it the default, fx-dependent), then that changes where S.M.A.dll gets put, and it manages to find the Modules directory okay in that case.\r\n\r\n",
