I measured the impact of the Steve's commit for .CPL and a result is this code, so I publish it. I measured with BenchmarkDotNet only the .CPL related code.\r\n- second commit remove extra SetSessionStateDrive method call. I haven't reliable tests to show perf win. Script tests have too much deviation. Main perf win in the code path (I mean AutomationEngine() ) is fixed in #10401 - there we exclude some extra file operations that is ~10 ms perf win on my system. But there still is extra SetSessionStateDrive method call - we remove this in the PR that will be ~<1 ms perf win.\r\n\r\nBased on the commit description I mark the PR as cleanup, not performance.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

This occurs in Powershell 6, started in 5.1, was not present in Windows Powershell 3 (Windows Powershell 4 has issues passing the SqlDataReader object to a function anyway).\r\n\r\nWhen you call a function within a Start-Transcript block, and that function then fills a SqlDataReader object, and then passes it onto another function, it increments the record a number of times, as if calling the read() method 7 or 8 times. This causes a number of issues, firstly, a lot of data is skipped for processing, secondly, you end up trying to read data which isn't available, resulting in an error.\r\n\r\nThis only occurs when Start-Transcript is called before running (and only while the transcript is actually running), and only when passing the SqlDataReader object to another function.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the following script. It will output 4 lots of values. The first one will error, the next 3 will not.\r\n\r\nIt attempts to run in the following manner - \r\n\r\nPass 1 (Fail) - SqlDataReader passed to a function within a Start-Transcript block\r\nPass 2 (Success) - SqlDataReader passed to a function\r\nPass 3 (Success) - SqlDataReader processed inline within a Start-Transcript block\r\nPass 4 (Success) - SqlDataReader processed inline\r\n\r\nReplace the $SQLConnectionString string with a real connection string, any SQL database should do (so long as it's SQL 2012+), no data needed in there.

    "body": "This is related to a longstanding issue with PowerShell that recently was brought up in a discussion on [PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC#215](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/215).\r\n\r\nConsider the following 10 object types:\r\n\r\n`System.Management.Automation.DebugRecord`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.InformationRecord`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.VerboseRecord`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.WarningRecord`\r\n`Deserialized.System.Management.Automation.DebugRecord`\r\n`Deserialized.System.Management.Automation.VerboseRecord`\r\n`Deserialized.System.Management.Automation.WarningRecord`\r\n`System.Exception`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock`\r\n\r\nWhen you are working with any of those types as _captured data_ (i.e. not as data that is streamed something other than standard output, but as something that you captured in a variable and are outputting in your terminal), if you pipe an instance of any of those types to `Format-Table`, `Format-List`, `Format-Wide`, or `Format-Custom`, you will still be presented with their default (custom) format unless you use the `-Force` parameter that is common to the `Format-*` cmdlets.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour, which has been in PowerShell since version 1, is unexpected. If you pipe data to a specific `Format-*` cmdlet, you expect that data to be shown in that format without having to `-Force` it.\r\n\r\nThe problem with `OutOfBand` is that the way PowerShell is programmed today, the `-Force` parameter is required to override the `OutOfBand` default output for a given type. That behaviour is the crux of this issue.\r\n\r\nI'm currently investigating what can be done, if anything, to allow these types to use the requested format without requiring `-Force`.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-FormatScriptBlock {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    Write-Verbose -Verbose -Message 'This function outputs a bunch of OutOfBand types.'\r\n    {Write-Output 'This is a script block'}\r\n    Write-Warning 'This might not function quite the way you think'\r\n    Get-Process -Id 1234321231\r\n    Write-Debug -Debug -Message 'Debugging is fun!'\r\n    {'This is another script block'}\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Test-FormatError {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    Get-Item -LiteralPath DoesNotExist -ErrorVariable myError -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\r\n    Write-Information -MessageData 'This outputs an error.' -InformationAction Continue\r\n    $myError\r\n    Write-Information -MessageData 'All done.' -InformationAction Continue\r\n}\r\n\r\nTest-FormatScriptBlock | Format-List *\r\nTest-FormatError | Format-List *\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nVERBOSE: This function outputs a

    "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\nThis behavior was originally observed while doing batch copies of blob containers with the Az CLI, but a simple contrived example is below.  ReproduceIssue.ps1 is a minimal script that fires off a batch of tasks defined in DelayedStdOut.ps1 that do not receive data to standard out until after the parent process has exited.  If I run ReproduceIssue.ps1 in pwsh on Windows, there is no exception and the late output is not redirected to the text file.  When it is run on a Linux container, there is an unhandled exception.\r\n\r\n**ReproduceIssue.ps1**\r\n```powershell\r\n$StdOutDelaySeconds = 5,\r\n$RequestBatch = 5\r\n@(1 .. $RequestBatch) | % {\r\n    $processParameters = @{\r\n        FilePath = 'pwsh'\r\n        ArgumentList = @( '-file', \"DelayedStdOut.ps1 $StdOutDelaySeconds\")\r\n        PassThru = $true\r\n        RedirectStandardOut = Join-Path -Path (Get-Location) -ChildPath \"$([System.Guid]::NewGuid().Guid).out.log\"\r\n    }\r\n    Start-Process @processParameters\r\n}\r\nStart-Sleep (2*$StdOutDelaySeconds)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**DelayedStdOut.ps1**\r\n```powershell\r\nparam(\r\n    $StdOutDelaySeconds\r\n)\r\nStart-Process -FilePath pwsh -ArgumentList @('-c',\"{Start-Sleep $StdOutDelaySeconds; Write-Output 'Test' }\")\r\nexit 0\r\n```\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nOn Windows, there is no exception and the standard output that was received after the process exited is not redirected to the file.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nWhen executed on Unix (Linux Azure Container Instance), there is an unhandled exception because the object is disposed when the data is received.  Under less contrived circumstances, the issue only appears intermittently.  I saw [this comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/8234fbb04b437748b6782e9c45b0026c374ef12d/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/Process.cs#L2192) in the if Unix region indicating that the ExitHandler waits for a second on another thread in hopes of avoiding a race condition whereas the non-Unix region has more involved logic.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nAn error has occurred that was not properly handled.

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a PowerShell user, I expect some (many!) conveniences with regards to comparisons and type conversions.  [dbnull]::value has had some improvement recently with #9794 but could use improvements with other comparisons, e.g. `[dbnull]::value -gt 10` should _not_ error out, at least from my perspective.\r\n\r\nA practical example.  Let's say I have a CMDB with dbnull in a few spots I want to do comparisons:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n#Example scenario with a function that uses Invoke-Sqlcmd2 to pull data\r\n    Get-XXXXServer | Where-Object{$_.VCNumCPUs -gt 8}\r\n    #Error for every line where VCNumCPU has DBNull value\r\n\r\n    #workaround before recent dbnull handling fix\r\n    Get-XXXXServer | Where-Object{[string]$_.VCNumCPUs -and $_.VCNumCPUs -gt 8}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is precedence for this:  `$null -gt 10` is `$false`, and `10 -gt $null` is `$true`\r\n\r\nCheers!",

    "body": "# Summary\r\n\r\nI'd think Expand-Archive is one of the heavily used cmdlets in various installation scripts. But currently you still need   to do a lot of unnecessary things like:\r\n- save temp archive file\r\n- remove temp archive\r\n- [in some cases] move files from the root catalog to some other folder\r\n- Also, it doesn't work with tarballs (big deal for linux)\r\n\r\nI think we should make Expand-Archive to pull archive directly from url avoiding writing/removing stuff on your disc. I guess that is not that hard to build some custom cmdlet, but I believe this should come out of the box, so installation script can rely on it.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nI need nodejs binaries in my project. I want to put this in \"node\" subfolder (but not in something like node-v10.16.3-linux-x64 ). In bash this could be achived this way:\r\n``` bash\r\nmkdir ./node\r\nwget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-x64.tar.xz | tar --transform 's/^dbt2-0.37.50.3/dbt2/' -xvz -C ./node --strip=1\r\n```\r\n### Desired powershell functionality:\r\n``` powershell\r\n$url = https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-x64.tar.gz\r\nExpand-Archive -Uri $url -type targz -Destination ./node -Strip -Force -Verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think many other core cmdlets with -Path parameter would benefit from  such thing too. Maybe  we can make Path to understand paths with http:// prefix. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

All PowerShell provider-related code was under a folder called namespaces. I can only guess that \"namespaces\" was the original name for what eventually became \"providers\".\r\n\r\nAt any rate, to set up `System.Management.Automation.csproj` for easier discovery of provider-related code, I renamed the \"namespaces\" folder as \"providers\". There are no code changes, just the renaming of a folder and some corresponding changes in `System.Management.Automation.csproj` so that it works the same way with the folder renamed.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThis is just some project cleanup to make it easier to find provider-related code in the `System.Management.Automation` project.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [X] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

So as of today, the PSReadLine is not very friendly to the accessibility aspect of the user experience.\r\nWhen it comes to `PSReadLine 3.0`, we will design with the accessibility aspect in mind from the very beginning.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4659\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

The reason for the \"future\" tests were because the initial PR work was to add SDK functionality, and then a follow-up PR was going to add parameters to some cmdlets that could be tested if the Experimental Feature was enabled. It turns out that if you do this, you'll get failures from a test in the `test\\powershell\\engine\\ExperimentalFeature\\Get-ExperimentalFeature.Tests.ps1` file on each of the platforms, and you may see a failure on a test in the `test\\powershell\\Modules\\Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\CompatiblePSEditions.Module.Tests.ps1` file on the Windows platform as well.\r\n\r\nHere are the contents of my `test/tools/TestMetadata.json` file that resulted in the unexpected CI failures:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n{\r\n  \"ExperimentalFeatures\": {\r\n    \"ExpTest.FeatureOne\": [ \"test/powershell/engine/ExperimentalFeature/ExperimentalFeature.Basic.Tests.ps1\" ],\r\n    \"PSManageBreakpointsInRunspace\": [],\r\n    \"PSForEachObjectParallel\": [ \"test/powershell/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Foreach-Object-Parallel.Tests.ps1\", \"test/powershell/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/ConstrainedLanguageRestriction.Tests.ps1\" ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe CI tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nYou'll see failures like the following:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n@KirkMunro, your last commit had 2 failures in PowerShell-CI-windows\r\nPSModulePath changes interacting with other PowerShell processes.System32 module path prepended to PSModulePath.Allows PowerShell subprocesses to call core modules\r\n\r\nExpected $null, but got @(Get-ChildItem : The 'Get-ChildItem' command was found in the module 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Management', but the module could not be loaded.

That means once a `ActionPreference.Break` is hit, the session will never be able to run script in optimized mode anymore.\r\nThis feels like a concern to me. I can imagine one scenario where people uses `-ErrorAction Break` -- I don't expect an error will be thrown but want to debug in case the unexpected happens, but after debugging (quit the debugger prompt), I would like the rest of my scripts continue to run as efficient as it can (in optimized mode). That scenario will be compromised as the debugger mode will always be `Enabled` after the `-ErrorAction Break` is hit, and thus the `Compiler` will generated unoptimized code for the rest time of the session.\r\n\r\nThere should be a way to disable the debugger after `ActionPreference.Break` is hit and the debugging session is done.",

It assumes some basis of CS knowledge but no specific PowerShell experience.\r\n\r\n**Related question:** \r\n\r\nThis \"Recommended Training and Reading\" heading doesn't seem quite the right way to put it? To me, at least, that implies that these resources have been personally vetted by Microsoft staff in order to be able to give a recommendation on the basis of some concrete assessment -- which at least at first glance doesn't seem to be likely for all of the items listed?\r\n\r\nI think we may want to update the wording for this heading as well. Maybe something more neutral such as \"Educational Resources\" might be slightly more appropriate? Open to suggestions, I'm not completely sure on that one. 🙂 \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

It results in a `TernaryExpressionAst`.\r\nAddress #3239 \r\nRFC: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/218\r\nThe old draft PR where a lot of discussions happened: #10161\r\n\r\nThe ternary operator behaves like the simplified if-else statement. The `condition-expression` will always be evaluated, and its result will be converted to boolean to determine which branch will be evaluated next:\r\n- `if-true-expression` will execute if the condition's result is evaluated as `true`\r\n- `if-false-expression` will execute if the condition's result is evaluated as `false`\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nTernary operator has lower precedence than binary operator, so you can write `$a -eq $b ? \"Hello World\" : [int]::MaxValue`.\r\nIn order to make the number constant expression work naturally with ternary operators, such as in `return ${succeed}?0:1`, characters `?` and `:` are made start-new-token chars conditionally when scanning for numbers.\r\nWhen it's known for sure that we are expecting an expression, allowing a generic token like `123?` is not useful and bound to result in parsing errors.\r\nIn those cases, we will force to start a new token upon seeing characters `?` and `:` when scanning for a number, so that that number constant expressions can work with ternary operators more intuitively.\r\n\r\nNote that, the implicit line continuance for `?` support was reverted in the latest code change based on the feedback I received within the team.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [x] Experimental feature name(s): `PSTernaryOperator`\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] Issue filed: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4648\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

This most commonly occurs to the operators, which in command mode, are not operators and instead are treated as unquoted arguments.  PSReadLine uses the TokenFlags UnaryOperator, BinaryOperator and AssignmentOperator to highlight operators, and so that is what it sees\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\necho 1 + 2 + 3 (1 + 2 + 3)\r\n#      ^   ^ not operators\r\n#                 ^   ^ operators!\r\n```\r\n",

A DashDash token can be accepted as a command, when used with the invoke operators, but it does not get flagged with CommandName, and so causes PSReadLine to highlight it as a operator.

The burden is that it's a lot of code to paste in to whatever use case comes up. Dot-sourcing is a bit better for readability, but now you have to manage multiple files which is easier in a repo than in a gist e.g. for a Boxstarter script.\r\n\r\nHere I'm using them in a CI pipeline that builds a Visual Studio extension that I publish. This demonstrates the need to use namespaces:\r\nhttps://github.com/jnm2/CopyFunctionBreakpointName/blob/0dc5885e4e38c2ff9384175419dbbb117c1652a8/build/Update-Version.ps1#L76-L89\r\n\r\nSimple modifications like this come up in build scripts quite frequently.

For Linux, it requires `xclip` and macOS `pbcopy` and `pbpaste`.  Had to `#ifdef` out a bunch of code that only works on Windows for copy/pasting non-text types.  On Linux/macOS, decided to retain the parameters even if not supported to provide a more detailed error message.\r\n\r\nHad to modify typegen as one of the types in Winforms being used has no HashAlgorithm so typegen threw.  Instead, it skips assemblies where no HashAlgorithm is used which appears to only be an Accessibility assembly associated with WinForms.\r\n\r\nTo support win-arm builds, creating new WINFORMS def in csproj and uses clip.exe to set the clipboard, but no cmdline tool on win-arm to get contents of clipboard so had to disable all tests on win-arm since it depends on getting content out.\r\n\r\nTo support PSXunit tests, default to Microsoft.NET.Sdk if SDKToUse is not explicitly defined.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4307\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission) https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/pull/4628\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here --> \r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

There was a bug that would make a breakpoint that was hit in a remote runspace render with a leading colon, which should only appear if the breakpoint is specific to a file. This bug was due to how the breakpoint object script property was dehydrated and then rehydrated when it passes through the MS-PSRDP protocol.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

    "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\n- Adds an experimental flag called \"Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.PSManageBreakpointsInRunspace\". All experimental functionality described below is enabled/disabled using that flag.\r\n- Removes the recently added `New-PSBreakpoint` experimental cmdlet. This functionality is provided via SDK commands for now, and will be provided via a `-Runspace` parameter on `*-PSBreakpoint` commands in a PR once this one is finalized.\r\n- Adds `SetCommandBreakpoint`, `SetVariableBreakpoint`, `SetLineBreakpoint`, `EnableBreakpoint`, `DisableBreakpoint`, and `RemoveBreakpoint` public APIs to the `Debugger` class, plumbs them through the engine, and hooks them up for remote debugger work. Also hooks up the `GetBreakpoint`, `GetBreakpoints`, and `SetBreakpoints` `Debugger` class APIs for remote debugger work.\r\n- Adds a `-NoInitialBreak` experimental parameter to `Debug-Runspace` and `Debug-Job` that allows users to attach the debugger without invoking a `BreakAll`. The corresponding methods for the same have boolean parameters allowing this as well.\r\n- Hooks up `Set-PSBreakpoint` to the new debugger APIs that have superceded the ones it used to use.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThis PR is needed for \"attach to process\" debugging in PowerShell Editor Services.\r\n\r\nIt helps because:\r\n- It allows scripters to fully manage breakpoints in a remote runspace without having to use `Debug-*` to attach the debugger to that runspace.\r\n- It allows Tyler to attach a debugger to a runspace without invoking a `BreakAll` in PSES.\r\n\r\nImportant details about this PR:\r\n1. It does not include Pester tests for the `-NoInitialBreak` parameter added to `Debug-Runspace` and `Debug-Job`, nor does it include Pester tests for the corresponding boolean value in the `DebugRunspace` and `DebugJob` APIs. I'm not sure how to automate that test, and believe it should be tested manually. Fortunately, that is an easy manual test to take on.\r\n1. The tests in the new `Breakpoint.Tests.ps1` file sometimes hang. I don't know why this happens. It has to do with working with a remote runspace and using the breakpoint APIs against it. It doesn't happen all the time, but it happens often. After 30 minutes, it will time out and fail. I need help identifying why this happens, by someone who understands the MS-PSRDP better than I do.\r\n\r\ncc: @TylerLeonhardt @PaulHigin @SteveL-MSFT \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] Some (experimental features are required if breaking changes are included).\r\n- **Experimental features**\r\n    - [X] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [X] Experimental feature name(s): Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.PSManageBreakpointsInRunspace\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

It's a generated guid which is persisted to disk.\r\n  * Added a unique identifier for the shell session\r\n\r\nI added an internal member to `System.Management.Automation.Platform` called `CacheDirectory` which makes it easy to find the location of the cache directory.

    "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen people build non-module tools that use the PowerShell SDK, they ultimately need to invoke some PowerShell commands. For tools are meant to function as a black box, the PowerShell commands that the tool invokes...\r\n\r\n1. ...should be hidden from the PowerShell debugger (so that breakpoints do not trigger on tool internals);\r\n1. ...should not pick up on user parameter preferences defined in `$PSDefaultParameterValues`;\r\n1. ...should not pick up on user invocation preferences defined in `$*Preference` variables;\r\n\r\nThis needs to be very, very easy so that tools can work as they were designed, without changes in behavior because of user preferences, and without the PowerShell debugger tripping on non-user code that is meant to be internal.\r\n\r\nFor a related discussion that highlights what tool makers need to think about in detail, see [this comment in issue #2121 of PowerShell\\vscode-powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/2121#issuecomment-519954671). That discussion also shows the scaffolding that is required to do something that should be very simple and supported in the SDK via a few flags.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nAny public interface that allows users to build PowerShell commands piecemeal (i.e. `AddCommand`, `AddParameter`, `AddScript`, `AddArgument`, etc.) and then invoke them needs to support invocation options that:\r\n- hide the command(s) from the debugger;\r\n- ignore `$PSDefaultParameterValues`;\r\n- automatically apply default values for any common parameters that are not explicitly used.\r\n\r\n~That's not very specific, so obviously more investigation would be necessary to identify where to create these options so that they can be used via public interfaces, and where the options would need to be plumbed through the PowerShell runtime so that toolmakers get the results they expect.~\r\n\r\n_Update copied from discussion below_:\r\n\r\nTo achieve this goal, `S.M.A.PSInvocationSettings` will be extended with a `DebuggerHidden` property, which would ensure the commands were hidden from the debugger, and a `IgnorePreferenceVariables` property, which would ignore $PSDefaultParameterValues and $*Preference variables. Programmers using the SDK can pass their `PSInvocationSettings` instance into `S.M.A.PowerShell.Invoke`, and with the new settings properly plumbed through the runtime, they won't have to worry about user preferences impacting internal APIs.\r\n\r\n",

Fix is to dispose of this object in the ScriptDebugger Dispose method.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThe_runspaceDebugCompleteEvent object is lazily created for a specific (Invoke-Command debugging) debugging scenario, but is never disposed.  All objects that contain system handles should be disposed after use.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

    "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nAs part of the cleanup of workflow code, this PR does the following:\r\n- Treats `ActionPreference.Suspend` enumeration value as not supported and reserved for future use.\r\n- Update internal logic dependent on `ActionPreference.Suspend` such that using that value results in appropriate error messages.\r\n- Remove unused resource strings.\r\n- Updated and added tests related to `ActionPreference.Suspend` to ensure that it is generating the errors we expect when it is used.\r\n- Remove unnecessary restriction around `ActionPreference.Ignore` (see [this discussion in issue 4348](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4348#issuecomment-490672315)). This change is made as part of this PR because it is in the exact same body of code, and it makes sense to include it here.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nSee issue #9570.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed: [MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs #4624](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4624)\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [X] N/A\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
