    "body": "@iSazonov @SteveL-MSFT \r\n\r\nI noted that while testing these changes the test I had previously constructed didn't provide particularly useful output, and changed it to also `-PassThru` the objects that it compares so that we can actually _see_ the commands it's comparing and the differences properly.\r\n\r\nI tested this locally and it passes, so hopefully the CI should pass as well. I noted as I went through there were still a few commands that _do_ have a properly-implemented `Medium` ShouldProcess level declared. If you like, I can run through and point out the ones that _probably_ should have a `Low` impact by my estimation and you guys can run thru and approve or deny any that shouldn't be changed?\r\n\r\nThere were also a couple as I ran through that I side-eyed and went \"really, _that_ didn't implement ShouldProcess?\" so there may be a few of those kicking about too. Hopefully most of those ones should be pretty obvious in the diff display, though.",
