It removes one of the annoyances in PowerShell (users being forced to use `-Force` to get a certain format from `ErrorRecord`, `Exception`, and `ScriptBlock` instances), the changes are small/localized, and it includes automated tests, yet it seems to just sit idle, making me feel I need to campaign for it to be looked at. Why? What's the minimum bar for that tag?\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT Time on preview 6 is running out, and PR reviews seem to have slowed down to being almost unnoticeable (72 open PRs). I understand prioritization challenges, but in some cases community members [can't even get an answer to a question](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/10238#issuecomment-541165711) to move [something that you indicated would be a welcome PR from the community](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6702#issuecomment-515147136) forward. Do you have plans to put some resources on PR reviews for preview 6 to try and get some of that work included in PS 7?",

Huge backlog (over 70 PRs) says that MSFT team too. \r\nCurrent priority order is security, bugs, compatibility fixes, new kill features (like we get &&, ||), only then rest. So that many community PRs are in line for a long time. On the other hand, looking at the GitHub statistics, I wonder how much PRs we merge every month.\r\nI think 70 PRs are in backlog too many for the project and the red line is at ~30 PRs. I hope we can achieve this.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It just calls into question why it was ever needed in the first place. ^^",
