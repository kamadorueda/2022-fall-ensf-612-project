    "body": "@iRon7 Even in non-strict mode, PowerShell tries to error on impossible behaviour. For example\r\n```powershell\r\n[int] \"abc\"\r\n```\r\nis an error (unlike say Javascript).  Likewise `123 + \"abc\"` is an error. `$x.nosuchmethod()` is an error.  `123/0` is an error.  `[type] 'nosuchtype'` is an error. As much as possible, we try to treat things that make no sense as errors. In particular, we wanted implicit (or explicit) type conversions to be rational so `[int] \"123\"` works but `[int] \"abc\"`.\r\n\r\n@SeeminglyScience \r\n> I think this would mostly end up just making typos harder to find.\r\n\r\nAgree 100%. Type names tend to be long so it's easy to make a mistake.",

PowerShell is not only programming language where the change would be good but interactive shell where hiding typos is very bad. The discussion shows that interactive scenario is more important and in scripts we can use strong syntax and/or simple workarounds if needed.\r\nWe could request Script Analyzer to recommend strong syntax. It is another argument that current compromise is good.\r\n",
