Can you please clarify why do you have such expectation?\r\n3) I was told that latest `ActiveDirectory` module is actually Core-compatible. To double-check this can you please copy-pase the contents of your `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\\ActiveDirectory\\ActiveDirectory.psd1`?\r\n\r\nThe general rule is: If a module location is missing from `$env:PSModulePath` then `Import-Module` (and, subsequently, `WinCompat`) won't be able to find the module if the import is done by module name (as opposed to full path to the module).",

    "body": "To clarify - yes, it works fine if I provide the full path to the module or add the System32\\WindowsPowerShell path back to `$env:PSModulePath` -- that's not the point of the issue. Up until PowerShell 7-preview.5, `C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules` was included in the default values for `$env:PSModulePath` and it no longer appears to be that way in PowerShell 7-preview.6, resulting in importing modules in that path (e.g. ActiveDirectory, DNSServer, etc) to fail without taking additional steps to readd the path yourself. Existing scripts importing those modules running with PowerShell 7-preview.6 will subsequently break.\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\n@anmenaga \r\n\r\n1. Here is the contents on PS 6.2.3 vs 7-preview.5 vs 7-preview.6 --- it looks like with 7-preview.6, the CurrentUser path for Windows PowerShell modules is swapped with the Machine path unexpectedly?\r\n\r\n### 6.2.2\r\n```powershell\r\n>> pwsh -noprofile -command \"`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion.ToString();`$env:PSModulePath -split [IO.Path]::PathSeparator\"\r\n6.2.2\r\nC:\\Users\\nferrell\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules\r\nC:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\Modules\r\nc:\\program files\\powershell\\6\\Modules\r\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 7-preview.5\r\n```powershell\r\n>> pwsh-preview -noprofile -command \"`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion.ToString();`$env:PSModulePath -split [IO.Path]::PathSeparator\"\r\n7.0.0-preview.5\r\nC:\\Users\\nferrell\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules\r\nC:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\Modules\r\nc:\\program files\\powershell\\7-preview\\Modules\r\nC:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 7-preview.6\r\n```powershell\r\n>> pwsh-preview -noprofile -command \"`$PSVersionTable.PSVersion.ToString();`$env:PSModulePath -split [IO.Path]::PathSeparator\"\r\n7.0.0-preview.6\r\nC:\\Users\\nferrell\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules\r\nC:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\Modules\r\nc:\\program files\\powershell\\7-preview\\Modules\r\nC:\\Users\\nferrell\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. As shown by the contents of `$env:PSModulePath` for previous versions, everything outside of a few early versions of PS Core 6 (if I remember correctly) contained `C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules`, hence the expectation for it to be present in 7-preview.6\r\n\r\n3. ActiveDirectory is indeed Core compatible and imports without issue if I provide either the full path or update the default `$env:PSModulePath` to include `C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules` again.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n@jhoneill - Definitely not anything in my profile altering the PSModulePath. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect things that worked up to 7-preview.5 to continue working, so long as there weren't any breaking changes introduced.",

This make sense -- the effective path ought to be a concatenation of the two.\r\n\r\nSince the PSModulePath is also a list of directories to search, it seems like its semantics should be the same as PATH's. And indeed PowerShell 5.1, based on experimentation, treats both PATH and PSModulePath specially -- both are the concatenation of the respective user and machine variables. (Actually, I don't know if pwsh is doing this, or if the process is inheriting the already concatenated values).\r\n\r\nIt seems like the change in behavior introduced with pwsh Preview.6 is significant. I can imagine that a lot of existing software might depend on the previous behavior. ",
