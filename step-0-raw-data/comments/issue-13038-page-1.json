Personally I think we were bound to hit an issue like this in the current \"generic token\" lexing implementation, since the tokeniser is required to recognise a context-free grammar here. That's the parser's job, and the scanner should be generating smaller and more appropriate tokens for it.\r\n\r\nSo we could theoretically make the scanning logic here more complex to try and avoid this, but we'd effectively be duplicating logic from the parser.\r\n\r\nInstead, the right solution would be to emit more tokens, representing a more digested input. In fact we can't even just emit two tokens, since just recognising an attribute requires a stack. Instead I would expect to see tokens like this:\r\n\r\n- LBracket\r\n- Identifier\r\n- RBracket\r\n- DollarParen\r\n- SingleQuotedString\r\n- RParen\r\n\r\nHowever, I worry about what other states bring us to this point in the tokeniser and what such a change could possibly break. (Needing to worry about that is exactly why the parser should be the single point of responsibility of such things)",
