    "body": "Some quick thoughts after looking into this :\r\nWe need to start by adding more exhaustive tests for the cmdlet since the current base of tests is lacking. This can ensure we don't break compatibility with the previous implementation. \r\nThen the move can be made to the new api. Mailkit seems great in terms of features, documentation and maintenance of the project. \r\nSince we can now run send-mailmessage tests on devops and other local environments that aren't Linux with a recently checked in PR for this test base it makes the work that much more CI friendly.
