    "body": "A decision was made very early on for PowerShell to build it on top of dotnet rather than C/C++ due to several reasons:\r\n\r\n1. C# being a managed language allows for more rapid development compared to native languages like C as you worry less about resource management\r\n2. dotnet framework provides an abstraction over many OS constructs.  So on Windows, you don't need to understand the idiosyncrasies of win32 apis for Processes vs Services and instead work with a consistent OO api.  With dotnetcore, we now how an abstraction over different operating systems.\r\n3. the breadth of dotnet framework means you can access many apis for various things as well as call into native apis like COM and C style exported functions\r\n ",
