If there is no valid comment based help before the function, comments at the start of the block (before any [cmdletbinding()] or similar) are merged  If the result starts with .Synopis, .Description, etc it is treated as help text and any help at the end of the block is ignored.\r\n3.

If you have \r\n```\r\n# foo\r\n<#\r\n.synopsis\r\n blah\r\n#>\r\n```\r\nOR \r\n```\r\n<#\r\nfoo\r\n\r\n.synopsis\r\n blah\r\n#>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCBH breaks.\r\n\r\nIf there is work to be done, after merging the pieces of help out any lines before the first CBH tag should be filtered and any CBH is left it gets used. . \r\nBut if the merge and filter process is to be \"fixed\", should merge cast its net a bit wider? I thought \"maybe\" now I think \"probably not\". So Ignore what I suggested yesterday \r\n\r\n\r\n",
