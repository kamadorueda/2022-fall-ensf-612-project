It's just me running my business and so... a little disturbing. I'm not certain but I'm seeing that wiki may be a coding point for these individuals. I'm not creating any more tokens or gaining any access for myself. I have to ride this one out, just like this Azure account finally expired, yet... lol, my computers, one laptop, one Dell desktop are down and I can't recover them myself. Good times. I have just had enough and I can not go this alone.  \r\n\r\nThank so much for doing what you do.\r\n\r\nIf no one tells you today, then let me be that person that tells you...\r\n\r\nYou are doing an AWESOME JOB ðŸ‘Œ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Uploading Document.docxâ€¦]()\r\n",
