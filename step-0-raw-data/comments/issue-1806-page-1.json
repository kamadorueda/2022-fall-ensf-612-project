    "body": "Yeah, we've discussed it.  Refactoring is a major design point for Roslyn, so *Trivia collections are pretty much required.\n\nIt might make sense to add *Trivia collections to PowerShell, but probably as a build time option in a stand-alone dll for PowerShell editor services.\n\nThe reason PowerShell doesn't have whitespace trivia yet is that it's not needed at runtime (really the most important scenario for PowerShell) and computing the trivia has a non-zero cost.  It took a lot of work from Roslyn to reach parity with the native compiler, so adding such a feature to PowerShell is expected to be a lot of work to do well.\n\nNow it's certainly reasonable to build the parser as a standalone dll as a tools such as PowerShell editor services - in that build configuration, having *Trivia makes a lot of sense.\n",
