    "body": "Sorry, clearly need to put more time into my issues search skills.  To me this is a question of completeness.  If 'uptime' (for example) produces output, then 'get-command' (or 'command') should resolve it.  I stumbled across this when I typed 'uptime' in the wrong window and then wondered why that worked.  My first response was to type get-command to figure out what just ran ... down (the shallow) rabbit hole.  I don't work with PS all the time and a lot of that is PS v5.0.  Knowing what is running and from where is rather useful.  Keeping up with all the changes to PS, .NET, C#, ... is for me a bit overwhelming since it isn't where I primarily work.  Anyway, sorry to cause work by posting a known issue.  Thank you for your reply and to everyone for the hard work they puts into these projects",
