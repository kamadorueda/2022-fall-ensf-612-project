    "body": "It's ironic that I'm the one arguing this -- I argued rather passionately against the no-output, no-error design pattern years ago in a discussion on the PowerShell MVP mailing list! Although at the time, my argument was _specifically_ against commands that behave differently when you have a simple name, versus a wildcard (thus allowing the possibility of multiple items).\r\n\r\nUltimately I was rather deluged with examples _from the broader ecosystem_ (Exchange, SCSM, etc.) showing examples of commands quietly returning nothing when they could have returned many things.  My point is that this is how PowerShell commands behave, in general:\r\n\r\n### _If the command **can** return MULTIPLE items_, then when there is nothing to return, they just return nothing. That's a deliberate design choice.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, you're wrong @mklement0, when you say that those commands don't return multiple items with simple parameters. Here are some concrete examples.\r\n\r\n```posh\r\n# There are about *eight* default rules that affect ScriptInfo, for example:\r\nGet-FormatData System.Management.Automation.ScriptInfo\r\n\r\n# Users can have multiple versions of the same module imported because of dependencies.\r\n# We can import multiple versions of Pester as an example...\r\n# (most of us have 3.4.0 and a newer one, right?):\r\nGet-Module Pester -ListAvailable | Import-Module\r\nGet-Module Pester\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it's not just those, most of the default `Get` commands do this **if** they _could_ return multiple items:\r\n\r\n#### During the first command of your session, there's no history (or, do `Clear-History; Get-History`)\r\n```posh\r\nGet-History\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When a folder is empty\r\n```posh\r\nmkdir emptyfolder\r\nGet-ChildItem .\\emptyfolder\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When there's no input:\r\n```posh\r\nGet-Unique\r\n# Or even ...\r\nGet-ChildItem .\\EmptyFolder\\ | Get-Unique\r\n# Or even ...\r\nGet-ChildItem .\\EmptyFolder\\ | Get-Random\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When there are no sessions\r\n```posh\r\nGet-PSSession\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When there are no commands\r\n```posh\r\nGet-Command -Verb Build\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When there's no TypeData:\r\n```posh\r\nGet-TypeData System.Boolean\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When there's no Jobs:\r\n```posh\r\nGet-Job\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When there's no scheduled jobs\r\n```posh\r\nGet-ScheduledJob\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### When the clipboard is empty, as after KeePass\r\n```posh\r\nSet-Clipboard $null \r\nGet-Clipboard\r\n```\r\n\r\nI trust I don't need to go through and test _every_ `Get` command to make the point?",

We agreed that the intent is that if a literal is passed and is not found, it should return a non-terminating error.  Cmdlets that don't have this behavior have bugs.  In cases where it's explicit or implicit filtering, it should return nothing.  We also agreed that we should revert this change and revisit making cmdlets consistent in 6.2.  Finally, the real issue is that we are missing Test-* cmdlets so users had to rely on current behavior with Get-* cmdlets to see if something exists and we should add those cmdlets in the future.",
