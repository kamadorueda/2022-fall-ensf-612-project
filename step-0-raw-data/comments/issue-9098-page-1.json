It's `requirements.txt` in a different format.\r\n- You can then use `Find-Module -IncludeDependencies`/`Save-Module` to download them into your directory (recursing on the dependencies).\r\n- Set `$env:PSModulePath` environment variable changes the order of module searching. This is the wheel for your proposed `$PSCurrentModulePath`.\r\n- You can then `Import-Module` the repo's module manifest. It will honor the priority set by `$env:PSModulePath`.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that's not here is the ability to use specific GitHub repos as the source of modules. This, however, could be solved easily by making that repo **a submodule of your git repo**.",
