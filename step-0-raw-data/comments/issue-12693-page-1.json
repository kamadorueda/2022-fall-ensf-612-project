Personally speaking, I usually don't dig too deep in the objects, and since I control the scriptblock, spending a little extra time to simplify the return object, doesn't seem too big a deal in my opinion.",

While a -watch parameter could be interesting as mentioned above it may not be applicable in all cases.  Personally, I think this is a big gap in the terminal experience of Windows and would love to see it added as a cmd in Windows out of the box because (a) it is useful beyond the scope of just PowerShell - e.g. watch dir and (b) it would smooth out the surface area between Windows and Linux/macOS for people that are using both or are migrating.",

There might be interesting scenarios.\r\nCurrently Format-Table does already specific thing - delay and collect object before starting output.\r\nSo Formatting System would keep a state. It says that we could add `-Diff` to Formatting System.\r\nAs result not only `Invoke-Watch` could benefit from this.\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\n`watch` by definition does \"runs command repeatedly, displaying its output\". It is a cycle. We haven't such cmdlet but we could. \r\nOur Test-Connection cmdlet can do a cycle with `-Repeat` switch (and ). We could generalize this like:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nInvoke-Repeat [-ScriptBlock] <scriptblock> [[-Delay] <int>] [[-Count] <int>]\r\n```\r\nIn the case Invoke-Watch could be implemented as\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-Repeat $sb | Format-* -Difference\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "I'd love to have this! I actually have this hacked together in a function in my profile using `Start-Sleep` and `Clear-Host`. The problem with that though is that there is a flicker because it first clears the screen, then draws the new content. It would be much nicer to have an optimized cmdlet that just overrides the content in place without flicker.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if there could be a way for _custom_ commands to return a \"stream of updates\". There are many non-generic commands that do this, like `kubectl watch` or `kubectl rollout status`. PowerShell equivalents currently have no good way to express this. Maybe a switch could be added to `Out-Host` and Format.ps1xml files to enable having every new stream item override the previous output? `HighlightDifferences` would then also be a switch that could be used together with it. Maybe those flags should also be present on `CmdletBinding()` to allow setting it without having to modify Formatting, for the use case of `Watch-Command`. I think this kind of system would be useful for other features too, like always making certain commands page (like `Get-Help`, or a PowerShell `git log` equivalent).",
