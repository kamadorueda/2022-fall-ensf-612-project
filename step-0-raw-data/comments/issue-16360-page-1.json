    "body": "Thanks @jhoneill.\r\n\r\nNot about a custom item property - not sure what it would look like?\r\n\r\nI'd like to see this to enable a format-Table/Format-List to format a different number of iterations without having to change `$FormatEnumerationLimit`. Just like you can, on a cmdlet by cmdlet basis, override ErrorAction (e.g. `-ErrorAction Stop`).\r\n\r\nRegarding your last point - I am pretty sure FormatEnumerationLimit was there from V1. I could be wrong. But whatever it was, enumeration on a cmdlet by cmdlet basis would be useful. I know it was this way in V2 in 2011 when I gave a [talk at the PowerShell Deep dive in Frankfurt](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-deep-dive-lineup). Later [Jeff Hicks posted an article about that talk](https://mcpmag.com/articles/2012/01/05/powershell-enum-limit.aspx).",

Any new switch for an existing cmdlet breaks things. Old scripts run on new PWSH (with relatively few exceptions)  but I've used things from PS 5 and found the customer's servers hadn't been upgraded from 4, I'm writing today in 7.2 and testing in 5 because it's Windows PowerShell only on these machines, so I can't use convertFrom-Secure string or the new operators etc. etc. \r\n\"Don't use X if you want the script to work down-level\" is OK advice. It's certainly better than \"You can't have X because then you can't run the script somewhere that you wouldn't want to :-) \r\n \r\n",
