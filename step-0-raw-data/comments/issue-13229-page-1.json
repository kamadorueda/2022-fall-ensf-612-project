There's no way to bypass the prompt with the way the cmdlet is designed.\r\n\r\nIMO changing it so that an explicit `-Confirm:$false` is respected would be great; `-Force` isn't appropriate here as we don't want the folder removed anyway.\r\n\r\nI'd expect maybe an error to be emitted stating the folder can't be removed without removing its children, but forcing a prompt here means that implementing the necessary logic for this to work in a headless environment / automation script would need multiple additional command calls (when it's clear Remove-Item is perfectly capable of determining if the container is empty in the first place).",

    "body": "> I don't disagree, but I'd say we then have a need for an additional switch for SupportsShouldProcess to explicitly bypass prompts.\r\n\r\nI do kinda wish `ShouldContinue` would always throw if the command is not the top level interactive command.  Probably too big of break though.  Yeah I'd be down for a `ThrowOnPrompt` style parameter (with a better name) to be added to `CommonParameters`. Or if you mean as a replacement for `-Confirm:$false` yeah I agree.\r\n\r\n> That's probably a separate issue, but either way I think the behaviour of Remove-Item here is awkward to workaround at the best of times.\r\n\r\nIt's barely awkward at the worst of times 😛 \r\n\r\nAt the best of times you're either removing a file or a directory with `-Recurse -Force`.  The worst of times is when you specifically only want to delete a folder when it's empty, which is pretty easily worked around by wrapping the `Remove-Item` call in a simple `if` block.",
