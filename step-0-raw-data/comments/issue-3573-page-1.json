Seems like PowerShell should treat modules as case-insensitive.  I don't see any value in allowing posh-git, Posh-Git and Posh-GIT to be different modules.  I think that would just lead to confusion.  IMO all of the module-related commands should be case-insensitive.  And if on Linux someone has both mymodule and MyModule dirs. and is trying to import Mymodule, PowerShell should warn the user about the conflict.",
