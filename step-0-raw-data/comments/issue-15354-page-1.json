Even assuming nobody intended for this category to ever be manually invoked as done in the reproduction steps, the ease with which it can be tells me this should be handled better.  `Write-Error` is not the sort of thing that should cryptically and silently fail when invoked in such a simplistic manner.  That's just asking for people (especially newcomers) to get into bad error handling habits to workaround the 'unreliable' `Write-Error`.",
