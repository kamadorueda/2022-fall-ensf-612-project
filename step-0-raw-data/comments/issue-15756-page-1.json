What makes these types worse? \r\n\r\nI think that the **generality** and the **specificity**  of a type defines the priority of how it is perceived.\r\nLike `2` is perceived an `[int]` and not as a `[double]` and `2.0` is perceived as a `[Double]` and not as something as a `[Version]`.\r\n\r\n### `[ipaddress]`\r\n*IP Addresses* are less general then *versions numbers* as you might have *IP Address Versions* but  not something like a *Version Addresses* (at least, I can't think of any). Besides, it concerns  an ***IP** Address* here, which even makes it less general than an (general) *address*.\r\n\r\n### `[datetime]`\r\nThe fact that `[datetime] '10.7.21'` has a lot of different formats (along with `[datetime] '10/7/21'` and `[datetime] '10-7-21'`) makes it less specific. Meaning that if I would read something like: `$x -gt 10.7.63`, I would automatically presume a *version* not a *date* (even it is my birthday ðŸ˜ƒ).\r\n\r\nAt the moment, I can't think of any other (general) type with a string constructor that accepts numbers separated by multiple dots. \r\n",
