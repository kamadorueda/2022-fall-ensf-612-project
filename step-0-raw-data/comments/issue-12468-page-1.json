    "body": "> Thoughts?\r\n\r\nHonestly that's one of the few situations where I will say PowerShell just isn't really going to work. The overhead of an *optimized* variable lookup alone could choke at 10 million data points, let alone the dynamic indexing, boxing, etc.\r\n\r\nEven C# might not be great for that.  Unless you're intimately familiar with when a struct would be copied, when to use `ref` or `Span<T>` or realistically unmanaged pointers, that's still going to be very difficult write with acceptable performance.\r\n\r\nWhen you're looking at that kind of scale you even need to start thinking about things like skipping the implicit bounds check of a normal array index operation to squeeze every inch of performance you can.  When you're analyzing performance at *that* level, PowerShell just isn't part of the conversation.",
