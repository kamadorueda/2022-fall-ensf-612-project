    "body": "You don't see it as a problem that so much time is wasted when a feature affecting change is merged without feature tests passing? \r\n\r\nIt is a tremendous waste of time. I don't want fast builds. I want things merged without other things breaking and the way we do that is with thorough testing.  We should absolutely switch around this project to do quick builds as the exception, not the rule. \r\n\r\nThe alternative is to have the maintainers be more diligent about this and triple check that a PR is feature affecting and has passed feature tests with the most recent commit. But that has proven a bad strategy as we continually have stuff merged that breaks feature tests (whether it's actually a regression or a test issue requires time an resources to figure out). \r\n\r\nIf our average turnaround for PRs was in the realm of hours, I might agree that fast tests make sense... but they aren't. Most PRs span days if not weeks. We introduced CI changes to stop existing tests when a new push is made (rolling builds) so multiple commits in a short period have no affect. \r\n\r\nI'm pretty annoyed that I get work delayed and pushed back because someone merged a test breaking change. It's not the odd occurrence.. it happens way too often. Most of my changes require feature tests so I'm stuck with PRs that can't merge due to failures that shouldn't be there in the first place. \r\n\r\nIf the maintainers can't stay on top of this, then we absolutely should switch to feature tests as the rule and bypass as an option.",
