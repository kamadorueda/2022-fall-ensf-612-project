However, we should be prepared handle the cases that are common, at least HTML and XML.\r\nThe right way to format HTML is to render it to a text document with default style, scripts disabled and all external resources blocked.  That means, in particular, normalising white space where appropriate, wrapping text to 80 columns, expanding character references, discerning block elements from inline elements, treating all nonstandard elements as text spans, using alternative text for replaced elements and rendering blockquotes, lists and tables as properly aligned text.\r\nThe right way to format XML is as indicated in the issue (that is, format as YAML), stand-alone, with external DTDs blocked.  That still means we have to honour inline DTDs, including text entities.  That means all information from attributes will be lost; this is consistent with the theory that XML should not convey key information in attributes.  I know, some XML formats do not think much of this theory—it will be their fault.\r\nAnd, as always, the original response body should be stored in the `TargetObject`.",

    "body": "If the HTTP server returns an error response in XML or JSON format, then the provider of the HTTP server presumably intends the response to be parsed by dedicated client software, rather than a generic web browser.\r\n\r\nIf the user of PowerShell is writing a script that sends requests to such an HTTP server, then the user presumably has access to documentation of the error response format and would benefit from seeing the response in that format. Raw XML or JSON would be fine in that case, optionally indented by PowerShell.\r\n\r\nHowever, if the user of PowerShell is running a script provided by someone else and is not familiar with the intended API, then it might be better to display the response in a different format, like YAML.\r\n\r\nI don't think the original response body should be stored in the TargetObject, if it is large. Errors accumulate in the $Error variable and could take up too much memory.\r\n\r\nLikewise, when PowerShell shows the error response to a user, it should not blast out many pages of text and should escape or filter out terminal control characters. A user who wants the exact error response can rerun the request with Invoke-WebRequest -SkipHttpErrorCheck. That is also what scripts should do if they need to parse the error response.",
