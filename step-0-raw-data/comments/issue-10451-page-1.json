(#9115 for context)\r\n\r\nThe CommandNotFoundException is a bit of an odd duck, it has the ErrorRecord as a _property_ of the exception. A bit of careless coding on my part actually resulted in this becoming an infinite loop. Took me quite a while to figure _that_ one out. CI would just... endlessly stall when it reached those tests, so believe I handled it by necessity in there.\r\n\r\nMightn't have been the best handling, I may need to revisit it and ensure I've not overcomplicated it or something, but yeah. ðŸ™‚ \r\n\r\nThanks for the heads up! ðŸ˜Š ",
