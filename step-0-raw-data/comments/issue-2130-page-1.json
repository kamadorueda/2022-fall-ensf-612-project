We also added the attribute [ArgumentCompleter](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c1faf1e6e10fc1ce45e84ef6f49ae7136c67a111/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandCompletion/ExtensibleCompletion.cs#L27) which can be used in both [C#](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/GetCommandCommand.cs#L102) and in PowerShell.\n",
