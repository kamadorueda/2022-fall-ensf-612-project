Thanks!\r\n\r\nItâ€™s been a while, and I no longer have access to the code to check.\r\n\r\n I did resolve the issue and get this working but I think the error was a red herring and the problem was with non-compatible dependency calls within the module.  I.e referencing windows specific commands.\r\n\r\ni believe I placed an OS check in the script and added branching logic.\r\n\r\nhope this helps.\r\nJ",
