    "body": "I dont see how Show-Markdown helps with this. It returns a string with VT sequences that is subject to the same wrapping and truncation problems.\r\n\r\nIt’s true that PowerShell needs to become smarter about escape sequences. PowerShell is _not_ just a byte stream shell like other shells, it is an object shell, and therefor also takes the responsibility of _formatting_ objects into byte streams. Part of that is wrapping and truncating strings. For that, you need to know the _user-visible_ length of a string as the terminal would render it, which means you need to be aware of VT seuqences. It’s not difficult to detect them, because it’s not a context-free language like HTML with nested balanced tags that you would have to parse, it’s a simple state machine. You can probably detect them with regular expressions.\r\n\r\nNow, the second related problem is, how does PowerShell prevent that a truncated string didn’t open VT sequences that were closed in the truncated part and now leak into all following output. One way is that it could detect sequences and close them.\r\n\r\nThe other big alternative would be for PowerShell to not allow VT sequences in strings to be output raw, but sanitize/render them, e.g. replacing the ESC byte with the symbol “␛”. Since it’s important that we have the capability to output escapes, PowerShell would then have to add other capabilities to Format files to output color. For example, there could be an attribute sanitize=“false” on ScriptBlock to allow the output of escapes, and element <Append> that allows to _always_ append a string even if the string gets truncated, which can be used for the user to specify closing sequences. This option would however break native commands that output VT sequences, because they output strings.\r\n\r\nPowerShell could also introduce a new type, VTEncodedString, that can be returned in those scriptblocks and does not get sanitized, but the truncation/closed tag issue would remain.\r\n\r\nIt’s also possible that PowerShell adds tags to Format files to color parts, like <color name=“red”></color>. But that would not work for the contents returned by a scriptblock (imagine coloring something complex like a git diff).\r\n\r\nConsidering all options, I think PowerShell should bite the bullet, become aware of VT escapes and properly count/close them.",

While the symptoms differ, the issue at hand is definitely a problem on all supported platforms.\r\n\r\nI really hope we can solve the problem for both width calculation and truncation (without having to resort to an encoded output form, as @felixfbecker mentions as an alternative) , although the latter sounds challenging.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the two related challenges are:\r\n\r\n* Only _printable_ (user-visible) characters in a VT-encoded string must be counted, for proper column-width / wrapping / truncation calculations\r\n\r\n* If truncation must be applied (based on the correct, printable character count) and that truncation - whose position must be calculated based on the printable characters - falls  _inside_ a _pair_ of escape sequences, the closing half of the pair must be emitted too (unlike what I pondered in #7767, emitting some sort of generic _reset_ sequence, if available, is suboptimal)\r\n   * The challenge is not only to recognize all those pairs, but that they can be _nested_ too; consider the following example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[pscustomobject] @{ test = \"`e]8;;http://example.org`aexample.`e[32morg`e[m`e]8;;`a\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn terminals that support it, that renders a link, with part of the link _label_ - `org` - rendered in a different color. If truncation were to fall inside that colored part, you'd need _two_ closing sequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> The simple solution would be to strip all VT100 escape codes with a regex before calculating string lengths.\r\n\r\nIt depends what you are doing. If you are going to leave escape sequences out of the content when displaying it as well, that's fine. But if you want to leave escape sequences in, *and* you want to truncate, it won't work.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have a string with Length 31, and you strip escape sequences, and now its Length is 25. You need to fit it into a cell that is 20 chars wide... where do you cut the string? If you leave the sequences in, and just blindly omit the chars from `str[20]` on, you might end up with less than 20 chars of content, and possibly garbage at the end (if you chopped in the middle of an escape sequence).\r\n\r\nSo in general, my strategy is not only to leave escape sequences out when calculating *content* width, but also to be escape-sequence-aware when truncating strings. (So if I need to fit a string into a cell 20 chars wide, I might actually end up with a string of Length == 24, because the display width will be 20.)",

    "body": "I agree, @oising, but let me frame it a bit differently (that pile is getting awfully tall):\r\n\r\nIf we were to start today, in the age of Unicode, we'd _only_ support the _dedicated control characters_ (in the [C1 range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C1_controls)) that are part of the Unicode standard, irrespective of these characters' _encoding_ and how many bytes the encodings happen to require.\r\n\r\nIn other words, using the example at hand: Unicode-aware applications (and such a qualifier should by now be the equivalent of asking for unleaded gas at a filling station) would have to recognize _only_ `U+009b` as CSI (irrespective of its encoding) and wouldn't have to worry about _also_ recognizing the 7-bit legacy representation that involves  _2 characters_ (ESC + `[`).\r\n\r\nFrom that perspective alone my vote is for the macOS terminal applications to (also) recognize a UTF-8 encoded `U+009b` char. as CSI.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRe the _strict semantics_ of Unicode characters in the [C1 control-character range (`U+0080` - `U+009f`)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#C1_controls); from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C0_and_C1_control_codes#Unicode (emphasis added):\r\n\r\n> Unicode sets aside 65 code points for compatibility with ISO/IEC 2022. The Unicode control characters cover U+0000—U+001F (C0 controls), U+007F (delete), and U+0080—U+009F (C1 controls). **Unicode only specifies semantics for U+001C—U+001F, U+0009—U+000D, and U+0085**. **The rest of the control characters are transparent to Unicode and their meanings are left to higher-level protocols**.\r\n\r\nIn other words: at the level of Unicode itself, `U+009b` - its specific name notwithstanding - has no _intrinsic_ meaning.\r\n\r\nAlso (ibid., emphasis added):\r\n\r\n> Except for NEL [U+0085] these are almost never used (**CSI is often used, but almost always by using the ESC,'[' 7-bit replacement**). The C1 characters require 2 bytes to be encoded in UTF-8 (for instance CSI at U+009B is encoded as the bytes 0xC2, 0x9B in UTF-8). Thus **the corresponding control functions are more commonly accessed using the equivalent two byte escape sequence intended for use with systems that have only 7-bit bytes**.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSpeaking pragmatically, again:\r\n\r\n* The 7-bit 2-character representation won't go away anytime soon.\r\n\r\n* `` `e[ `` is easier to type than `` `u{9b} `` (at least on a US keyboard).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
