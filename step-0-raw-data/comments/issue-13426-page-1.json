I didn't say it was officially deprecated.  Tbh no really talks about the syntax because it's incredibly limited.  You can only pass at most a single array as args, and you can't even keep the syntax when there are no args.  Also strict mode explicitly throws if you use that syntax for whatever that's worth.\r\n\r\nObviously if you like it no one is going to stop you from using it, but it doesn't make sense for the language to actively design around it more than it already has (which isn't really that much, it mostly works by accident).",

I'd much rather they have not allowed it in the first place, but taking it away *now* doesn't really win much unfortunately.

Early on in PowerShell's history there was (and probably still is) some folks who used functions with a \"method like\" syntax e.g. `Get-ChildItem('path')` etc.  I thought that's what you were going for in the OP but I see you were just talking generally about parsing rules.",
