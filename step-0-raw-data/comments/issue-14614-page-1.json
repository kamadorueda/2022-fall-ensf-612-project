    "body": "@iSazonov - Thanks for getting back. I dug into this some more based on your comment above. I cloned this repo and built it locally. If I understand correctly, the issue is that 'dotnet build' generates an apphost.exe program not from the source code but from some sort of template program, and this generated program is then renamed to pwsh.exe. Is your contention that the issue causing apphost.exe to have pwsh.dll as its OriginalFileName has nothing to do with the way the PowerShell build is configured?",
