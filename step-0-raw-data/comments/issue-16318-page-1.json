PowerShell formats the response based to the data type. For an RSS or ATOM feed, PowerShell returns the Item or Entry XML nodes. For JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) or XML, PowerShell converts, or deserializes, the content into [PSCustomObject] objects.  Note When the REST endpoint returns multiple objects, the objects are received as an array. If you pipe the output from Invoke-RestMethod to another command, it is sent as a single [Object[]] object. The contents of that array are not enumerated for the next command on the pipeline.  This cmdlet is introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0. Beginning in PowerShell 7.0, Invoke-RestMethod supports proxy configuration defined by environment variables. See the Notes section of this article. </div></blockquote>",
