Although it was more work, I love being able to back and forth in history more than just once, especially when I switch between different git repos.\r\nYou can follow the history and PR discussion in the 2 PRs #5051 and #7206 and related issue #2188\r\nThe best you could maybe do is to propose a setting but the PowerShell team generally does not like this idea very much due to the test coverage becoming complicated.
