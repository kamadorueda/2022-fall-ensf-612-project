    "body": "This `[104m` looks like an escape sequence used for terminal instructions like changing colour of text, e.g. \"dotnet\" is yellow in your screenshot, so there will be a \"change colour to yellow\" sequence before it, and a \"change colour back to white\" after it that get handled by the terminal and not shown as text. This `[104m` is not being handled correctly and is breaking through where it shouldn't - maybe it's not written quite right.\r\n\r\n`\\e[0;104m` is close to it, and would be setting an intense blue background, which you have as the background colour in your screenshot. So maybe that's what it is supposed to say, and has a missing `0;` in it, so it's not handled as a colour, and is being printed as text.\r\n\r\nTracking where it's coming from would help; things you could try:\r\n\r\n- `Remove-Module PSReadline` - does it still happen after that? this enhances the prompt, and is involved in some colour settings. (This will only temporarily remove it, get it back by closing / restarting PowerShell).\r\n- `Get-Module` will list running modules; can you share the list? One of them might be causing this.\r\n- `Get-Content $Profile` is the scripts running at PowerShell startup, if you have customised it, it might be loading something which affects this.\r\n- Starting a command prompt, and then running `pwsh` inside it and seeing if it still happens in a more basic terminal.\r\n\r\n>  the space charter is displayed as what I believe is the Unicode code.\r\n\r\nIf it was a Unicode space, it would look the same as any other space; Unicode was built so that all the basic English letters, numbers and symbols from American (ASCII) computers would be the same.\r\n",
