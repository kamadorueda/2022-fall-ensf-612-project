(in particular the use of interfaces on attributes is less conventional in C# and it might be worth exploring or suggesting an alternate implementation)\r\n\r\nEssentially this is a fairly large proposed API and we need to stress test the proposal somewhat, in the form of things like counter proposals, exploration of invalid configurations or implementations, a look at performance implications, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce some discussion is had here, we can then discuss a prototype, RFC, and/or PR.",
