So it won't work here as far as I can tell.  If there was some way to create and use the child SSH process such that it is not part of the process group (so that it doesn't get Ctrl+C signals) but still can use a tty for user prompt, then that would be great.  But I don't currently see a way to do this.  However, I am definitely open to any ideas as this would be preferable to using SSH_ASKPASS!",

I reread the discussion and it looks that `sigaction`  is exactly what we wanted. \r\n\r\nI believe we should consider [sigprocmask](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/sigprocmask.2.html) \r\n\r\nBefore the code review I still have thoughts how make it easy. Because we search just a workaround for Unix we can: \r\n1. Use simple wrapper to run \"ssh\" like [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4515274/externally-disabling-signals-for-a-linux-program) \r\n2. Ask OpenSSH team to add new option for ignoring SIGINT.\r\n3. If none of the preceding is satisfied we continue the PR as is.\r\n\r\nI'd rather not complicate the code and use (1) option.\r\n\r\n",

Instead I just want the SSH process to ignore the signal.\r\n1. That is what this fix is!  The only difference is that we configure the SSH process start to ignore the signal instead of having the SSH process do it.\r\n2. Or do you mean to move the fix from PowerShell into OpenSSH?  I agree that we should pursue this in the long term but there are a couple of problems:\r\n - The change may not be accepted or it may take a long time to get accepted as the OpenSSH group must think about wider consequences and compatibility issues.\r\n - Even if we get the change approved it will still leave many systems with older versions of OpenSSH and without the needed fix.  Fixing this in PowerShell ensures it will just work after installing PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThe nice thing about open source is that the code can be refactored by anyone if/when a better idea comes along.  But for now I feel this is the best solution.",

A big theme from the presenter was that best practices and accepted patterns were many times poor choices performance wise.  One of the top things the presenter looked for when investigating performance problems was unnecessary work such as memory allocations, thread creation, uses of locks, and other system resource usage.  So after that the idea of creating an unneeded process when it is just as easy to create a single process seems undesirable.",
