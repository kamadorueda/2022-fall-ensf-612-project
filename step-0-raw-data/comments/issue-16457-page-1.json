    "body": "Thanks @iSazonov, this information is very helpful.\r\nQuoted from: https://stackoverflow.com/a/68580426:\r\n> In Json.NET [13.0.1](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/tag/13.0.1), Newtonsoft changed the default MaxDepth for JsonReader (and hence all derived reader types including JsonTextReader) to 64:\r\n>> Change - JsonReader and JsonSerializer MaxDepth defaults to 64\r\n\r\nThe `ConvertFrom-Json` command in PowerShell already specified the `MaxDepth` in `JsonSerializerSettings`, so it should not be affect. Therefore, it's likely that the PowerCLI module is directly calling APIs from `Newtonsoft.Json.dll`, and should be updated accordingly. @xenadmin can you please open an issue in https://github.com/vmware/PowerCLI-Example-Scripts about this?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/7dc4587014bfa22919c933607bf564f0ba53db2e/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/JsonObject.cs#L179-L187\r\n",
