My interpretation is that the author is looking for a generic, easy way to override the alias translation on a particular string (specifically mentioning \"like bash does\")\r\n\r\nWhichever way you slice it, though, it seems a documentation upgrade to the about_aliases help could show this method of temporarily overriding aliases, as others have asked the question about doing so.\r\n\r\nThanks and sorry for the interruption.",
