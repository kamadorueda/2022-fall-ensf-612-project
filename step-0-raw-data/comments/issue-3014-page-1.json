    "body": "Feedback from @daxian-dbw that makes sense to me:\r\n\r\n- I think we should by default continue to build native component for OSX and Linux. Unlike pwrshplugin.dll, libpsl is much more crucial to PSCore (it has important native implementations that PS engine needs to call in via P/inovke), and it changes far more frequently than the WinRM plugin dll -- for example, @jeffbi made changes to it to fix the cyclic symbolic link detection issue in file system provider; @PaulHigin made changes to it to create the SSH process for remoting.\r\n- For pwrshplugin.dll, pwrshplugin.pdb and Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1, they should be made into a NuGet package and published to powershell-core feed. So we can depend on dotnet-cli to handle them and it's also more robust and cleaner. When we need to make changes to pwrshplugin.dll, we just publish a new version of the NuGet package.\r\n",
