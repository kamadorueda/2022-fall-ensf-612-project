    "body": "I think it was using `_ParameterSetName` \"by design\" as `ParameterSetName` is not available in commands that derive from `Cmdlet` instead of `PSCmdlet`. `RemoveServiceCommand` could derive from `PSCmdlet` but that would break the derived methods. `ServiceBaseCommand` could be switched to derive from `PSCmdlet`, but that would probably take a review committee approval.\r\n\r\nLooking for guidance from other cmdlets, many of them are using \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nif (InputObject != null)\r\n```\r\nand\r\n```csharp\r\nif (Name != null)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample [`RenameLocalGroupCommand`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/fb7c7b038b720fc78d92662ac3405029b8db625c/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts/LocalAccounts/Commands/RenameLocalGroupCommand.cs#L188)\r\n\r\nI lean towards either switching to the null checks or just leaving it as `_ParameterSetName`. I can see benefits to the Service Cmdlets being directly invoked fro host apps, so Moving to `PSCmdlet` seems like a bad option.\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT @iSazonov thoughts?",
