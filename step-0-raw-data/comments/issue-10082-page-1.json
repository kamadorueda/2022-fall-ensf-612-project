    "body": "This seems like the wrong approach to addressing frequent variable lookups. I feel like I've described a better approach elsewhere, but I'll repeat here anyway.\r\n\r\nA better approach would:\r\n\r\n* Use the `VariableAnalysis` pass to assign integer indices for each dynamic lookup - one index per unique `VariablePath`.\r\n* Store an array of `PSVariable` in the `FunctionContext` for dynamic lookups.\r\n* On dynamic lookup, first check the function context for the given index. If the entry is not `null` **and** the variable was not deleted (Remove-Variable), you can skip the scope search.\r\n* Otherwise, proceed with a normal dynamic search. Upon a successful search, store the found `PSVariable` in the `FunctionContext` for subsequent lookups.\r\n\r\nThis is the rough approach I implemented in PowerShell V2 but never got around to implementing in the new parser. It works quite well.",
