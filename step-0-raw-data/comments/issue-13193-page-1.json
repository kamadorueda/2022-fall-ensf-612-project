An example is populating a template from a dataset.\r\n> \r\n> What about `Set`, `Edit` or `Import`?\r\n\r\n`Set` would be the closest.  To me, `Edit` has the connotation of human interaction and `Import` means bring in something verbatim.  May the solution is:\r\n\r\n| Verb | Meaning\r\n|---|---\r\n|`Set`| Put a value into a container verbatim.\r\n|`SetFrom`| Override a value with a newly calculated one.\r\n|'`SetTo`| Set a new value by calculating from an existing one.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# So, to populate some templates, you would have:\r\nforeach($data in $dataset) {\r\n    SetTo-Template -Name 'TempX' -Values $data `\r\n        | Set-Contents $filename+$data[0];\r\n}\r\n\r\n# To parse a template to a set\r\nforeach($template in templates) {\r\n    $dataset+= ($template | SetFrom-Template -Name 'TempX');\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nEdit: Swapped the meaning of `SetTo` and `SetFrom` after looking at my example.  This feels better.  But, it really shows that using better verbs such as `Populate` and `Parse` would be better. (Neither currently exist).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> Get-Verb populate\r\nPS C:\\> Get-Verb parse\r\nPS C:\\>\r\n```",
