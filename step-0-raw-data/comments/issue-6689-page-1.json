    "body": "@iSazonov there's no immediate plan to support Connect/Disconnect with anything other than WSMan.  I've submitted some doc updates to reflect this.  Longer term, we will want to support this scenario.  However, on Linux/macOS, you would use `screen` which isn't available on Windows.  I think it's fine to close this issue as we'll have to revisit the SSH remoting hosting problem when we try to enable JEA for SSH remoting.",
