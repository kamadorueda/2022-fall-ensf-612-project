VSCode uses a rust-coded library- https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/ whose author made changes specifically to accomodate them- @BurntSushi . \r\n\r\nThere's also https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser which doesn't seem maintained right now and Chromium but I don't know how easy it is to pull in external code.  \r\n\r\nPS: I am an honorary member of the Rust action strike force, which pressures people into rewriting already existing codebases into Rust.

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT,\r\nThanks for the explanation. It never occurred to me that IE would have been the used as part of the library. In consideration of the evolution of Powershell, I suppose it made sense in 3.0 when it was generated specifically for Windows. I still think ConvertFrom-Html is sort of a hack (no offense intended). For maximum compatibility, it would be better to have rewrite the library to parse the HTML in a similar manner that the IE Library did it and return a compatible object type.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile -UseBasicParsing removes the one class defined by IE (mshtml library), it also removes other objects unnecessarily, Scripts, AllElements, Forms to name a few that are readily available. It seems it should be easier to override the ParsedHtml than to write a crutch app to append to the call.\r\n",

The default HTML parsing and the reliance on IE is one very common Windows PowerShell pain-point for using IWR in headless environments. (Because IE had to be configured before first use). \r\n\r\nIMO, the design choices in the early IWR and IRM to break the singe responsibility principle in favor of ease of use has hamstrung the cmdltes to this day.
