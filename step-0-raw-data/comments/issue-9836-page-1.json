Also the type conversion algorithm is intended to be reasonable i.e. you should be able reason about what will happen or at least be able to understand why a particular conversion was chosen after the fact. Making the conversion order mutable makes it much harder to reason about.",

So I think we should let people shoot themselves in the foot with them (but provide easy ways to disarm...)",
