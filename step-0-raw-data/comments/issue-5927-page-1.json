And why? \r\n\r\nRegistry is common place for Windows applications to store settings:\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724871(v=vs.85).aspx\r\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms973902.aspx\r\n\r\nThis is critical for enterprises. By using GPO/GPP, they can centrally manage (distribute polices and settings too) applications on workstations and server farms.\r\nFor example, if they receive feedback from employees that their scripts fail because of a stack overflow, the enterprise administrator can easily propagate the parameter value as a default that does not overlap local settings at the application or user level.\r\n",
