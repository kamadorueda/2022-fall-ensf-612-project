The @ symbols stopped appearing in the PS session and we could type commands successfully using the onscreen keyboard.  When the keyboard was re-attached and the machine put back in to normal mode, the problem reappears.  The device is an HP Elite x2 G4.  It is current on all BIOS and system drivers.",
