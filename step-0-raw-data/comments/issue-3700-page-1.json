We could try to be a little more clever and if we're trying to create a symlink and a) the item on `-Path` already exists and b) the item on `-Value` does not, we could do something \"git-ish\" like:\r\n```\r\nItem F:\\tmp\\bar already exists. Did you mean \"-Path F:\\tmp\\foo -Value F:\\tmp\\bar?\"\r\n```\r\nNot really a prompt, just a hint. Of course we'd probably want to know if target path was given via `-Value` or `-Target` and adjust the message accordingly.\r\n\r\nOr just a new message specific to symlinks when the path item exists? Either one would be fairly easy.\r\n",
