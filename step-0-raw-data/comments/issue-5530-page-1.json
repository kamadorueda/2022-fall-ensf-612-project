    "body": "Hmm I'm wondering what standard we should follow here. RFC 8259 released in December 2017 now enforces UTF-8 (no-BOM) encoding for JSON. https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-8.1\r\n\r\n> JSON text exchanged between systems that are not part of a closed ecosystem MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629].\r\n> \r\n> Previous specifications of JSON have not required the use of UTF-8 when transmitting JSON text. However, the vast majority of JSON-based software implementations have chosen to use the UTF-8 encoding, to the extent that it is the only encoding that achieves interoperability.\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT  Do we have any kind of guidance on what standards should be followed and how soon after acceptance they should be implemented? Currently RFC 8259 is set as \"Internet Standard\" and has obsoleted the standard @Jaykul cited (RFC 4627) but conflicts with EMCA-404 which still allows for any Unicode and not exclusively UTF-8. I agree with the IETF that UTF-8 reigns supreme (I don't personally know a single JSON API that returns anything other than UTF-8).\r\n\r\nIt would seem to me the default encoding for application/json responses should be UTF-8. I'm torn on whether we should ignore or honor the char encoding provided by a remote endpoint. I think part of this could be solved is we enforced UTF-8 but allowed users to supply their own response encoding via parameter. this would solve some of the other open issues where char detection is not working because the remote endpoints are not being compliant.

Historically, when no charset is defined in the header ISO-8859-1 was assumed. So if we changed the default for everything to UTF-8, legacy systems will be potentially broken.  This is complicated because now the default charset for HTML5 is UTF-8. HTML5 becomes heavily reliant on charset in the `Content-Type` HTTP response header and then the HTML rendering engine uses that to interpret the first `<meta http-equiv=\"content-type\"` or `<meta charset` to switch encoding for the inner elements. Unless HTTP response header includes an alternate charset, one should assume the the charset is 8859-1 to ensure backwards compat.\r\n\r\nUltimately, we will never have perfect encoding in this project because we do not aspire to be a full parity web browser. For HTML, My hope is that when we move to AngleSharp for HTML rendering they can handle the terrifying task of navigating all the charset complexities for us.",

    "body": "@chuanjiao10 I understand the CJK user experience is currently bad. I have a personal interest in addressing that (for the limited amount of 日本語 I deal with). The problem is that `Invoke-WebRequest`, under the current plans, no longer seeks to be a full parity web browser. In PS Core, it doesn't even support HTML parsing at this point. `Invoke-RestMethod` should work for APIs in any part of the work because JSON and XML follow stricter standards (and this issue in particular is about bringing the cmdlet into even close alignment with standards). \r\n\r\nI really do feel much of the CJK pain will be reduced when we can add in a proper HTML parser. This project doesn't have the resources to make its own full functioning browser, so we will be relying on another community project that does. I also feel that adding the ability for the user to supply their desired character encoding will address some of this pain. \r\n\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest` will very likely never directly support multiple encoding scenarios allowed under HTML5. But, `ConvertFrom-Html` would in theory would. That leaves us with navigating only the baseline encoding for the \"outer envelope\". \r\n\r\nFor that, we must follow standards, as painful as they are for a significant user population. Current standards make it clear the default for HTML must be `iso-8859-1` and that it is the responsibility of the remote endpoint to suggest an alternate encoding when something other than `iso-8859-1` is used. This is on the web developers and web server admins more than us. Though, we can and do seek to make this less painful. We currently support a wide range of encoding detection. It's not perfect but it can also be improved give specific examples where it breaks down. For when that breaks down, allowing you to supply your own encoding should work.",

    "body": "@chuanjiao10 That solution uses Internet Explorer's engine to parse the HTML and determine internal element content type. Internet Explorer is full fledged web browser. It has teams dedicated to complexe charset identification and string encoding. `Invoke-WebRequest` is not a full web browser and does not have those kinds of resources. Internet Explorer inter-op is not available in PowerShell core so this solution cannot be used in PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod` in PowerShell core now support charset detection in the HTML for the outer most tag. This is an improvement over PowerShell core 5.1. They do not and likely will not ever support it in the inner elements. That is a task for a separate cmdlet.\r\n\r\nUTF-8 is supported. If the server declares `charset=utf-8` in the `Content-Type` header and if it is declared in the outermost HTML element. This is not limited to UTF-8. Support for any encoding that .NET Core supports is possible. \r\n\r\n> Why WebCmdlets very bad for a long time?\r\n\r\nI can't answer that. I don't work for Microsoft.. I'm a community member like yourself. 😄  I do share some of your frustration, though. That's why I have been contributing.\r\n\r\n> `\"<a charset=xxx> C </a> <a charset=yyy> J </a>\"` in html4 is not standard?\r\n\r\nIt is, but that is only something that can be implemented in a web browser where you can click links and the browser has context surrounding the URI it retrieves. You are not clicking links in `Invoke-WebRequest`, you are providing URI's. The burden is 100% on the web developer and web server administrators to ensure the response for a given endpoint returns the proper charset definitions in the \"outer envelope\".  Otherwise, PowerShell has no context to understand what the charset should be based on an anchor element.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell, this would be accomplished by accomplished by parsing the uri and charset from the HTML anchor element (`<a>`), calling `Invoke-WebRequest` with that information. if we exposed a way for you to declare what encoding type you are expecting it would be possible with something like `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -ResponseCharset 'UTF-8'` or something.\r\n\r\n> if WebCmdlets do not do well, calling an external mature library\r\n\r\nLike I said, we will be using an external library for HTML parsing (AngleSharp). But this wont be baked into `Invoke-WebRequest`. The focus of the web cmdlets has shifted beginning with 6.0.0. HTML parsing will never return to them. Instead, a separate cmdlet will be introduced so it can be used for more than just `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod`. `Invoke-WebRequest` alone wont do what you want even in the future. But, there will be a way with something like `$Html = Invoke-WebRequest $uri | ConvertFrom-Html`\r\n\r\nI should also note that as far as I know none of these changes will be ported back to Windows PowerShell 5.1 or older. To get these benefits, you will need to move to PowerShell Core.",
