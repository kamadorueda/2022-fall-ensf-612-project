It unblocks PowerShell script files that were downloaded from the Internet so you can run them, even when the PowerShell execution policy is RemoteSigned. By default, these files are blocked to protect the computer from untrusted files. Before using the Unblock-File cmdlet, review the file and its source and verify that it is safe to open. Internally, the Unblock-File cmdlet removes the Zone.Identifier alternate data stream, which has a value of \"3\" to indicate that it was downloaded from the Internet. For more information about PowerShell execution policies, see about_Execution_Policies. This cmdlet was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0. </div></blockquote>",
