    "body": "@markekraus This doesn't seem like a duplicate of #2662 to me.  #2662 seems to be about restricting SSL/TLS _protocols_ and _protocol versions_.  This issue is about restricting the _cipher suites_ offered during SSL/TLS negotiation.  These are two different, but related aspects.  ([This page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt813794(v=vs.85).aspx) shows, for example, the cipher suites that _could_ be enabled on a Windows 10 computer for each version of TLS.) \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in order for it to be possible for PowerShell automation using https to remain up-to-date with current policy (e.g. keep up with browsers) we need control over (at least) the following on a per-call basis:\r\n\r\n1. Certificate Validation (#4899)\r\n2. Permitted Protocols and Versions (#2662)\r\n3. Permitted Cipher Suites (this issue #5159)\r\n\r\n",
