They are there best practices to avoid unintended/wrong behaviour and therefore apply to any file using PS syntax IMHO. PSPossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull is the best example where it can result in e.g. an if condition that always evaluates to true. I can understand if you are concerned that in the case of PSPossibleIncorrectComparisonWithNull, changes in the code of the actual product could lead to a regression and should be excluded but in the case of PSAvoidUsingCmdletAliases, I do not see a reason as to why cs/md files should be excluded.

    "body": "@bergmeister Thanks for the comment, and you have very good points. Yes, my main concern about changing the `.cs` files is the potential regression. Given the size of changes, it could be easy for us to overlook something in the review. That being said, I think you are right that the scripts declared in C# code should follow the rules as well, but I would suggest that we leave the comments unchanged in C# code, especially those that still use other aliases.\r\n\r\nAs for the PSScriptAnalyzer rules, it's very useful to write easy-to-maintain and less error-prone PS script files, but it's not necessarily always applicable to any PSH syntax, for example, the script that serves as a one-liner command for you to run interactively, in which case aliases may be more preferred because they make the command concise and easy to type. The changes in [`KnownIssues.md`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/4261/files#diff-f25db63262b5a4a08e655687e9e2ec18R53) would be a good example of it -- `ls (gci *.txt | % name)` is a command for a user to run interactively, and thus it's OK to keep the aliases. It's a similar idea for scripts in c# comments -- those simple scripts are only for demonstrating the scenarios, and thus it's OK to use the aliases to keep them concise.",
