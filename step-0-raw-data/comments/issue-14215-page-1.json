Having a version number in the file path is problematic because every time the store app is updated, the path changes and therefore the firewall rule becomes invalid and requires manual configuration.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nPowershell 7 is one of those apps that has a version number in the file path.  I.E.\r\n\r\n`%ProgramFiles%\\WindowsApps\\Microsoft.PowerShell_7.1.0.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\\pwsh.exe`\r\n\r\nThis is why it's necessary to use an app package name instead (see item \"**2**\" in the original post), so that every time the app is updated, the firewall rule still continues to work.  However, \"app package name\" or \"app package SID\" do not work as expected – hence the post.\r\n\r\n",
