In the GUI, I have limited options to choose representation of th text in the chart.  Unfortunately, PowerBI (currently) seems to have simple logic in that if any data point is > million, it sets the units to millions.  So any data point < 1M shows as 0M (although not literally 0).  I'll just leave this part as-is as the other option is to just show the percentage, but as the numbers grow, having the units will be more interesting.",

This leaves just 6.0, 6.0-preview, and 6.1-preview.  It looks like a few people have custom builds where they don't have the label so they show up as just 6.1 in the monthly view, but the numbers are so small it's just noise.  This doesn't give a view of the specific version people are on, but does give a view of whether they've moved to 6.1 and from preview to stable channels (which is more relevant once 6.1 GAs since 6.0 didn't have this well defined).  cc @joeyaiello ",
