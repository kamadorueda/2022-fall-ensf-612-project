If you override `TabExpansion2`, then anyone else trying to do the same will completely override you.  I'd love to see something like an interface that can be registered in the engine to incrementally augment completion. Something like:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic interface ICompletionExtension\r\n{\r\n    IEnumerable<CompletionResult> CompleteComment(CompletionContext context);\r\n\r\n    IEnumerable<CompletionResult> CompleteMember(CompletionContext context);\r\n\r\n    IEnumerable<CompletionResult> CompleteCommandParameter(CompletionContext context);\r\n\r\n    IEnumerable<CompletionResult> CompleteCommandArgument(CompletionContext context);\r\n\r\n    // Other cherry picked methods from CompletionCompleters/CompletionAnalysis here.\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic class CompletionEngine\r\n{\r\n    public void RegisterCompletionExtension(ICompletionExtension extension);\r\n\r\n    public void UnregisterCompletionExtension(ICompletionExtension extension);\r\n\r\n    // Mirroring CommandCompletion.CompleteInput\r\n    public CommandCompletion CompleteInput(\r\n        Ast ast,\r\n        Token[] tokens,\r\n        IScriptPosition positionOfCursor,\r\n        Hashtable options);\r\n}\r\n\r\npublic partial class EngineIntrinsics\r\n{\r\n    public CompletionEngine Completion { get; }\r\n}\r\n```",
