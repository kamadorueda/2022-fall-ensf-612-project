In fact, the issue very much resembles https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine/issues/17, and they suggest install ConsoleZ, I do not want install 3rd party consoles. Their issue was closed with the words \r\n\r\n> Closing - there is unlikely anything I can do about this. I guess you need to type exit if you want to exit faster.\r\n\r\nwhich is today unacceptable, since as far as I understand PSReadline now is part of standard Powershell 5.0 and should work properly by default.",

But I suppose the problem is maybe due to some Antivirus activity burden. For example, I installed and uninstalled AVG Free Antivirus, and noted that it causes some delay to Powershell closing (although not as bad as it was initially when I asked the question).\n\n—\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2804#issuecomment-268310264> , or mute the thread <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/APOZ_jZltaW8hK9QORN4FPoD-H4uVmPMks5rKBWdgaJpZM4K_Zq7> .  <https://github.com/notifications/beacon/APOZ_jIm9sfKqY9jbrJf81Rrwn-whTyFks5rKBWdgaJpZM4K_Zq7.gif> \n\n",
