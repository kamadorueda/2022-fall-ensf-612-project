    "body": "I see that the team has a separate csproj for publishing to NuGet, which kind of makes sense because the actual SMA project targets .Net Core but for consumers of the NuGet package, it is only acting as a reference package (a bit like a C++ header) and therefore consumers do not need to target that same runtime (in fact the PS team has recommended for a long time to use .Net Standard, therefore this is a surprise to me that such a bug seems to have slipped in without anyone noticing). Because the file got moved, tracking it's history gets a bit complicated.\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/tools/packaging/projects/reference/System.Management.Automation/System.Management.Automation.csproj\r\nI am wondering if the bug is somehow caused by using a newer object type (e.g. Span<T>?) being present in the references that is not part of .Net Standard?\r\nEven if so, I'd expect the team to offer a NuGet package with multiple targets (which NuGet supports), so that the user has more or less PS APIs available depending on the user's target. Being able to target .Net Standard 2.0 (and in the future 2.1) is still quite important and useful, since .Net 5 (where everything should get united), is still a long time away.",

NuGet has features to allow users of packages to have such a user experience, hence why I expect this behaviour from the SMA package, it might be that you need to include different DLLs in SMA's NuGet package for different targets but this is an implementation detail that an end user usually does not see. Whilst I understand that this might require quite a bit of work from the team, I'd think this is still a common and valueable use case for the SMA package to work when targeting netstandard2.0 or netstandard2.1. Because the 6.1.0 package works fine at the moment, I think most people have not spotted this problem yet. In theory one could tell people to keep referencing that package (although 6.1 generally goes out of support in about a month) but it doesn't sound right.",

We should have both, but it's a matter of prioritizing time needed to get them out (unless someone else submits a PR!).  We should have version specific ref assemblies for developers who are trying to target specific versions of PowerShell.  We should also start thinking of a PowerShellStandard.Library 6 to have more APIs available (@bergmeister, please open an issue in the PowerShellStandard repo if one isn't there already!).",
