    "body": "> How can I upgrade??\r\n\r\nYou have two main options.\r\nIf you have the ```Install-PowerShell.ps1``` script (you can find it here in this repo), just run it - the script downloads and runs the latest MSI. Note when you run it, you have the option of updating via MS Update (ensure it's checked).\r\nIf you have enabled updating via MU, then can just wait. It takes a couple of weeks after release to GitHub before MSFT can get it over to MU. I am not sure WHY it takes so long, but it does work. ",
