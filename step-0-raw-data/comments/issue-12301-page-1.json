    "body": "> I want to directly ask if this introduces the possibility of cloning a command, running on a different thread and then corrupting command info state somehow due to thread safety issues\r\n\r\nThe answer is: yes, it could cause thread safe issue when using `FunctionInfo`, `FilterInfo`, `ScriptInfo` and maybe `ExternalScriptInfo` in a different Runspace because the ScriptBlock associated with those `CommandInfo` object has Runspace affiliation to the Runspace they come from. The Runspace affiliation will cause the execution of them be marshaled back to the original Runspace, which could potentially cause deadlock or corruption of the original Runspace. We have an issue on this ( #4003) that was observed by using a PowerShell class instance in a different Runspace.\r\n\r\nHowever, the public API `PowerShell.AddCommand(CommandInfo commandInfo)` already make it possible to add a `CommandInfo` object from Runspace A to the PowerShell instance that will be invoked on Runspace B. From that perspective, making this change doesn't expose a new issue, but just make the existing issue easier to be hit by users ðŸ˜…\r\n\r\nGiven that, I'm fine making this change, but hesitating if this change should be serviced (will leave that decision to @SteveL-MSFT)",
