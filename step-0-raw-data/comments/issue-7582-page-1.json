Or do you have any kind of idea what percent of users are pulling it in? My hypothesis is that folks on older LTS are less likely to want new dependencies (eg. Snap), but I don't have any real data there.\r\n\r\nLastly, the \"more Linux distros\" line makes sense to me in principle, and I feel like we went through the formatting and wording already with AppImage. Could we pull that up and see if it makes sense to match what we had there? ",
