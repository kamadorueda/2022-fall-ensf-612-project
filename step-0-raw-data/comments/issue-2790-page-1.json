    "body": "We will likely have to call this by design.\r\n\r\nIt looks like .Net added some overloads to `String.Split` - I've listed the interesting ones here:\r\n\r\n```\r\nstring[] Split(char[] separator, int count)\r\nstring[] Split(string separator, System.StringSplitOptions options)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe second one is new. PowerShell ranks conversions of each argument to try and disambiguate which overload you really meant.\r\n\r\nBecause PowerShell tries extra hard to convert anything to anything, we needed a way to disambiguate overloads in a reasonable way that felt natural. After analyzing many different overloaded apis, we found that method parameters are typically specified in order of decreasing importance, so we decided that we would weight the conversion rankings in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nIn your example, we have arguments `string, int` and are attempting to match `char[], int` and `string, StringSplitOptions`.\r\n\r\nBecause we weight the first parameter/argument higher than the second and because the first argument is an exact match, we attempt to call this new overload.\r\n\r\nSo I'm not sure there is a good solution. If PowerShell had a character literal, that might help.",
