What we don't agree on is what alternatives should be offered to users who want to use the native binaries by default. Some options that have been floated include:\n- An environment variable to turn off all the aliases that collide with *nix binaries\n- A single character (like `^`) that automatically falls into the native PATH\n- Tell people they have to `bash -c` (many said this is too many characters to be usable)\n- Tell people that they have to provide the full path (this experience technically already works, but it's very poor)\n- Side suggestion: Leverage the \"hinting subsystem\" to tell people that they may have wanted to use the native command if they use parameter sets that match patterns against the native *nix binaries. This can still only work when the command fails (`rm -e`, for instance, would not fail). \n",

The existing PowerShell faithful can recreate their *nix aliases easily enough or better yet, wean themselves off those aliases.  \n\nIn fact, now that we have PowerShell on Linux, I'd like to see the built-in *nix aliases removed from all OS versions of PowerShell Core - if they aren't already.  That would leave built-in aliases that match the built-in PowerShell commands and don't attempt to \"fool\" you.  \n",

Some aliases might be more problematic than others, e.g. `sort` might be used more than `ps` or `ls` in scripts.\n\nWe've certainly discussed some options such as providing a module you just import to get those aliases back.

A great example is, _dir /s_. That command fails in PowerShell so you have to change it to dir -recurse.\n\nSo there are really three related issues here:\n1. Not all parameters are aliased\n2. Not all native parameters or behavior is mapped in the PowerShell CmdLet.\n3. Need a way to run native command if alias exists\n\nI don't think #1 is too bad of an issue and would make things worse if they were aliased. Dir -recurse is a more readable parameter than dir /s anyway. Plus with the cross-plat, it makes scripts inconsistent when trying to move from Windows to Linux and the reverse. \n\n#2 and #3 are most important. I never used curl, but I know I've run into limitations with Invoke-WebRequest that I would expect curl to be able to do. (Don't remember off top of head).\n\nShort-term, I think you need both a config option as well as a way to call the native command if the alias is enabled. \n\nDefault, leave it enabled. This is PowerShell.... on Linux. It should behave as PowerShell so they can learn what CmdLets to use. My co-worker with a Linux and Perl background found it much easier to figure out the cmds he needed to get a script working. I think it was grep, ls, and man that was key for him. Using man should help them figure out how to use the cmd properly.\n\nLong-term, add coverage to the native cmdlets to have all the parameters and capabilities of native commands. This enhances PowerShell for Windows and Linux by giving us more powerful options. Some of the behaviors will likely need to be converted to multiple CmdLets and use Objects and Pipelines, but that is a great thing! If it didn't do that, then what would be the point of PowerShell?\n",

The powershell grammar is not compatible with standard unix grammar, for example you can do `rm -rf` in unix but in powershell you have to do `rm -r -fo`.\nTherefore you will never reach parameter compatibility no matter what.\n",

    "body": "@be5invis This goes against how parameters work in PowerShell. They are orthogonal, and if not, there are different parameter sets. They also only have long names and instead of short names they can individually be abbreviated as long as they remain unambiguous. In your case you'd also need to add an alias to that parameter, `fr`. Also suddenly `-Recurse` would no longer be able to be shortened to `-r` but instead would have to be `-re` to not clash with your proposed `-rf` parameter.\n\nYou could ask the same question from the other side: Why not specify both parameters separately? You're willing to go against PowerShell code principles and conventions in quite a big way only to keep pretending you're still working with the same Unix tools, even if you're not. However, the GNU parameter conventions with their short and long names are hardly universal and lots of well-established tools go against them, e.g. `tar`, or `find`. Yet you're not up in arms on their bug trackers to change them. While a core part of Unix has always been that there are a billion different utility programs that each work in slightly different ways, suddenly having yet another one of them (admittedly doing a bit more and trying to encompass lots of other utilities in itself) is so disconcerting and problematic that it has to be changed? I don't think so.\n\nRemember: The shell on your machine is yours. Just as people alias `rm` to `rm -i` for their own comfort, there is nothing preventing you from removing the `rm` alias and have a function wrapping `Remove-Item` called `rm` with an `-rf` parameter.\n\nBut trying to change PowerShell in its entirety to completely replicate every single Unix tool is fairly misguided.\n",

My fingers seem to type `ls` before my brain even sends a signal to them.\n\nThe problem is that those existing basic commands to not produce objects. The actual change to be made is not from `ls` to `gci`. The bigger change is from the thinking done to process lines of text to thinking about the properties of and what methods can be applied to an object.\n\nIt is every user's right to make whatever aliases they want. I would agree that it could be made easy for the user to do this by adding a method and property to $Host (System.Management.Automation.Internal.Host.InternalHost) to enable or disable native command replacement. I have seen others, but is there a GUI profile configuration tool included with Powershell?\n",

PowerShell needs to respect and work with popular, native utilities as best as it can - period.  That is after all, one of the primary jobs of a \"shell\".\n",

    "body": "@rkeithhill So let me clearify: For users want to use Powershell, they want types, right? However your native tools, like `/bin/ls`, cannot communicate with types. Therefore, switching to a typed shell, but without typed utils, the change is meaningless.\n\nTherefore, typical Unix users may want to type the identical command, but get the typed result directly. So there is two options:\n1. Purpose a typed IPC protocol and tell Linus to update their tools — No, they wont’t, because it is purposed by their **ENEMY**, the **EVIL LORD**, the **destroyer of the free world**! They are going to “embrace extend and extinguish” us! or...\n2. Alias `ls` to a builtin with compatible parameters.\n",

    "body": "> For users want to use Powershell, they want types, right?\n\nEventually, they probably will.  That said, I work with a number of devs I've started on PowerShell by **merely** selling them on using it with Git and Posh-Git (something CMD can't provide).  They rarely pipeline anything at this point but I expect them to get there.  That point is, the git.exe utility behaves under PowerShell just as it behaves under CMD.  Easy transition.  \n\nTo me, ls (like ps, grep, sed, awk, gcc, curl, etc) is just another native utility that any \"shell\" should be able to run.  Now, if someone is ready for and wants the object emitting command for listing container contents, they can use `Get-ChildItem` or its alias `gci`.  If they are of the bent that they will never use the native `ls` utility, then they can create a `ls` alias for Get-ChildItem in their profile.     \n\nBTW I don't think trying to make `Get-ChildItem` parameter compatible with `ls` is feasible.  You'll get hung up pretty quickly with PowerShell parameters not being case-sensitive e.g. -c/-C, -d/-D, -i/-I.  And PowerShell doesn't support parameter combining e.g. ls -rt.  It's a reach and it violates PowerShell's Monad principle.  A task like sorting would be done by a separate cmdlet (Sort-Object) and not by Get-ChildItem itself.\n",

A completely separate command parser (along with completely separate command metadata, formatting for `Get-Help`, ...) is a bit overkill (apart from replicating much of PowerShell's internal workings in an incompatible manner.\n\nThere's always going to be two separate worlds here, one native, one typed. PowerShell already services both of them, by being able to execute native programs and cmdlets. I personally don't see any benefit (just a massive undertaking in development effort) in trying to add a layer above native commands that replicates their parameter metadata within PowerShell. Besides, what would you do about `tar`, or `find` (and lots of other programs), which AFAIK don't adhere to the GNU conventions. Implement yet _another_ command parser, along with wrapper functions to call those? Note also that for a command parser to work, the native program's arguments have to be parsed within PowerShell and must not conflict with the language. Something that might be difficult with weird things like `[`.\n",

We should make it as easy as possible for new users to get started with PS–if I saw something about PS, tried to check it out, only to discover that I needed to relearn everything about the command line to use it, I would probably be much less likely to bother with learning it than if I could fire up PS, type `ls` and immediately see the type system in action. Yes, I could use aliases, but if I'm just trying out PS in a few spare minutes I'm unlikely to want to do much configuration before I jump in and start playing around.\n",
