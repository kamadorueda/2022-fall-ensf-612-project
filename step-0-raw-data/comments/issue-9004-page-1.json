    "body": "OK, after digging through this last night, I don't think that what I'm trying to do _can_ be done without a kludge. I dug through the underbelly of the path resolvers, and got stuck looking for where the `ExpandPath()` method is implemented. I can only find the virtual declaration of the method, and one implementation that does a basic check and proceeds to then go back and call the virtual method. The actual code that it executes doesn't really appear to be in this repository. Is it in an external library?\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this as it stands, I would have to do something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n1. Test if the returned paths are null & the input path(s) contain wildcard expressions.\r\n    * Non-wildcard paths should error out rather than returning `null`\r\n2. Attempt to recursively/repeatedly resolve each parent node, splitting off and retaining leaf nodes one at a time, until I obtain a non-null set of paths that resolve to container nodes.\r\n4. Then, I can proceed to iterate over my set of paths, appending the total leaf nodes to them.\r\n5. Return the resulting paths.\r\n\r\nIs this an acceptable solution for the behaviour, or is this not worth the change, do you think?",
