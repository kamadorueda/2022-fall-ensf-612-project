    "body": "@onriv thanks for updating the issue!\r\n\r\nWe're conflating a few separate issues here, but ultimately I think you could resolve them all without too much difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe `*-WmiObject` cmdlets were deprecated in PowerShell version **3**. Please use the `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet as a replacement; for most tasks they are a drop-in replacement, parameters are all very similar or identical in a lot of cases. Some things previously directly referenced as methods on the objects may need to be handled with `Invoke-CimMethod` instead, however.\r\n\r\nYou will most likely not be able to reliably import a Windows PowerShell core module in pwsh, or if you can I would expect reduced functionality as it is over a remoting connection. I wouldn't count on it, and it's better to use the CIM cmdlets in pwsh instead.\r\n\r\nAs for the Visual Basic issue, not really sure where to begin on that, but I'd check the documentation for those libraries to see what's changed in the .NET Core versions of those. In a lot of cases, the GUI functionalities of many libraries were removed. That's neither here nor there, it's far beyond what PowerShell has any control over.",

    "body": "@onriv in your last example, you've already loaded `D:\\Users\\sha*****\\Apps\\PowerShell-7.0.0-win-x64\\Microsoft.VisualBasic.Core.dll` when you import the GAC's `C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.Net\\assembly\\GAC_MSIL\\Microsoft.VisualBasic\\v4.0_10.0.0.0__b03f5f7f11d50a3a\\Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll`. It's loaded because you've already used the `Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction` assembly in your first command. That means you can't load the second assembly; you get the first one, whose `Interaction` has no `InputBox` method.\r\n\r\nIf you start a fresh PowerShell session, this will work:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nAdd-Type -Path C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.Net\\assembly\\GAC_MSIL\\Microsoft.VisualBasic\\v4.0_10.0.0.0__b03f5f7f11d50a3a\\Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll\r\n[Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction]::InputBox(\"Enter your name\", \"Name\", \"Lastname\")\r\n```'\r\n\r\nIn this case though, I would recommend using [a WinForms solution](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/samples/creating-a-custom-input-box?view=powershell-7), since that's supported by the DLLs that come with PowerShell (so no Add-Type from the GAC needed).",
