It does mean that you can't index using a collection reference but that was viewed as being a fairly obscure secondary scenario.  The workaround is to simply use the `item` property:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS[1] (20) > $a = @{($index1 = (1,2,3)) = \"one\"; ($index2 = (4,5,6)) = \"two\"}\r\nPS[1] (21) > $a.item($index1)\r\none\r\nPS[1] (22) > $a.item($index2)\r\ntwo\r\nPS[1] (23) >\r\n```\r\nNote that changing the current behaviour would be a significant breaking change so I'm not sure what you are proposing here.",
