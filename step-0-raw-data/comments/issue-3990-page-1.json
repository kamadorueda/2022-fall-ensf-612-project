Also you have to consider that you would never say that as a person I am going to go an invoke sleep when you go to bed, it would be that you go and try to start to sleep.\r\n\r\nThis would be a change for the sake of change with actually almost no benefit bar being entirely pedantic in nature and actually would lead to confusion. Which is why I made my original comment, one I still stand by considering I've been not just a user but also a trainer of PowerShell and every user who I've come across who looks at the cmdlet just by name understands what it does and those that may be unsure can always read the help for `Start-Sleep` & they would understand what `Start-Sleep` does by the Description from the help that states\r\n```\r\nThe Start-Sleep cmdlet suspends the activity in a script or session for the specified period of time. You can use it for many tasks, such as waiting for an operation to complete or pausing before repeating an operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo yeah, to wrap up I can't see **any real** benefit from making this change",
