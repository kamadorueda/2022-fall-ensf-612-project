You mirror `appimagetool`, and we rewrite the script that generates the AppImage to use it (no other things downloaded via `wget`)\r\n2. You build at least `runtime.c` as part of your builds, and we rewrite the script that generates the AppImage to use it, `mksquashfs` (from the distribution repository) and a even more bash scripting (no other things downloaded via `wget`)\r\n\r\n2 is significantly more work than 1.

Linus wrote [an interesting piece](https://plus.google.com/+LinusTorvalds/posts/7tp2gYWQugL) on why it's not a big deal for Git given that hashes aren't being used for security, but I guess he wasn't thinking of our particular scenario. ;) ",
