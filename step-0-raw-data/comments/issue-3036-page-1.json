I guess that makes sense to set IndentCacheMax in 256 or even more.\r\n2. Perhaps it's not too expensive to immediately initialize cache from 1 to IndentCacheMax? This will simplify and speed up the code.\r\n",

    "body": "1. The padding is rarely the full window width.  I experimented with `dir c:\\windows\\system32` and found the longest padding used was 120 with a window width of 229, so I think 120 is a reasonable upper limit.\r\n2. I disagree that initializing the full cache is a better choice.\r\n    * Many of the entries would go unused (using data from the above experiment).\r\n    * I want to avoid additional work at startup, not add additional work.\r\n    * More objects means more time in GC, also something we want to avoid.\r\n    * Assuming _not initialized_ adds 1 `if` on the normal path and 1 `Interlocked.CompareExchange` on the less common path, both of those operations are fast.",
