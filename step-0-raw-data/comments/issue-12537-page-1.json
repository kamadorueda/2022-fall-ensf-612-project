    "body": "This is due to `FileSystemInfo.ToString` changing in .NET itself.  This issue was discussed in #7132 and it was ultimately decided by the PowerShell committee to maintain this behavior in [#7132 (comment)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7132#issuecomment-503773204):\r\n\r\n>The work involved to maintain compatibility is not worth the effort as the underlying platform has introduced a change to fix an inconsistency problem. This results in a breaking change for some PowerShell users, but detecting of this will be quick and using `.FullName` or `.Name` as appropriate is the right thing to do. We could make a change in `Join-Path` to support joining two absolute paths to make this simpler for scripts, but that would be a separate issue.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking it's best to avoid depending on stringification anyway. Instead, use the property that explicitly holds the string you're looking for:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam(\r\n    [ArgumentCompleter( {\r\n        (Get-ChildItem).Name\r\n    })]\r\n    $Object\r\n)\r\n```",
