After adding a throw away \"EXIT\" command to the bottom the email message was sent even though the error messages were still placed in the log.   As this was a single powershell script with no nesting I can't say whether or not execution would continue if this script had been called by another powershell script and was expecting to have control returned.   This script was invoked via pwsh inside a bash script and the bash script did continue, although I didn't check to see if there were error codes returned from pwsh.   ",
