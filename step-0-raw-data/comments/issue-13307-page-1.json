    "body": "@daxian-dbw  IIRC the primary goal for splatting method arguments was really just to splat method arguments. This is a useful thing by itself and would bring parity with the ability to splat  arguments to commands. However as a side-effect for doing this, it became possible to do the equivalent of named parameters by splatting a hashtable. This is probably still something we should support. However doing it this way makes it _value_  based and thus highly dynamic v.s. a _syntax-based_ solution which would lend itself to static analysis. So I am now of the opinion that we really should do both: formally supporting named parameters and also supporting  splatting in method calls. In fact, in general we should allow splatting in any collection context (splatting hashtables into hashtables, splatting arrays into arrays, etc.) ",

I'm afraid we don't have enough expertise to make changes to the code, and thus the COM method support is not in scope.\r\n\r\nWhoever is going to work on this issue can first target making it work for .NET methods. Although COM/Script are not in scope, it doesn't mean they shouldn't be supported, but just should be a separate task/issue.",

As for the \"general splatting\" support, I think it's interesting and worth more discussion.",
