    "body": "@evandrix See #1705. We'd like to produce PowerShell Core for all supported versions of Windows (Win7+), but have a few remaining issues with our packages for Win 7 and Win 8. The fix, once identified, is potentially something that we could include in Alpha.10.\n\nAs @kilasuit mentioned, you will need to install a WMF to get PowerShell Core to work as expected on Win 7. Between Win 7 and Win 8, significant changes were made to WMI and WinRM (PowerShell dependencies) that make some form of WMF a pre-requisite. \n\nI am closing this issue because we already have #1705 to track Win 7 support.\n",
