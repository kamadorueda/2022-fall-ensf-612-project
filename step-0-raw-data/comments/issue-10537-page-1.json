Sure when somebody uses runspaces and writes 3 non-obvious lines to create a new runspace and control a lot of things about how it's created, it's reasonable to expect to set the location explicitly. When you have a `%` loop and realize that it can speed up by parallelization, it would be nice to change as little as possible after adding `-Parallel`. I don't think that people would know they need the parallelization before actually writing and trying the code for a normal foreach. So less friction is it to include `-Parallel` the better.\r\n\r\n> Changing this either way would be a huge breaking change.\r\n\r\n`ForEach -Parallel` haven't been realized in any stable build yet - I don't see changing behavior of it as a breaking change.

I've created an issue for it: https://github.com/PaulHigin/PSThreadJob/issues/46\r\n\r\nHowever, given that for `Start-Job` it is a _fixed_ directory, users are much more likely to have come to depend on it.\r\n\r\nGiven that experimental features are an \"on-ramp\" for regular features, how do you see that transition unfolding?\r\n\r\nEven if users adopt the experimental feature in significant enough numbers, turning it into a regular feature can still break existing code if it is turned into a regular feature.\r\n\r\n",

We could guess that user would use relative path to Documents folder.
