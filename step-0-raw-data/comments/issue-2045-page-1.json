    "body": "There are 2 runspace initialization apis, `RunspaceConfiguration` from V1, and `InitialSessionState` from V2 onwards.\n\nWe had plans to remove `RunspaceConfiguration` from PowerShell Core, partly because we don't need to support snap-ins, but also trying to reduce the api surface.\n\nWe made the apis internal in PowerShell Core for the time being, e.g.\n\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c1faf1e6e10fc1ce45e84ef6f49ae7136c67a111/src/System.Management.Automation/minishell/api/RunspaceConfiguration.cs#L107\n\nBut longer term, we'd hoped we could remove them completely.\n\nAre `InitialSessionState` and the corresponding apis like `SessionStateTypeEntry` and `SessionStateFormatEntry` a viable replacement for you?\n\nNote that one reason we want to remove them - maintaining the 2 code paths is extra work, e.g. the work I did to speed up PowerShell startup was primarily done for `InitialSessionState`, so runspaces using `RunspaceConfiguration` won't see the same improvements.\n",

    "body": "Nice! If those are the V2+ apis to replace `RunspaceConfiguration` then that will definitely be a viable solution for me as I want to ensure that my module keeps up with what the latest apis are. I'll work on testing `InitialSessionState`, `SessionStateTypeEntry` and `SessionStateFormatEntry` and integrating them into my [module ](https://github.com/proxb/PoshRSJob) so it is up to date. Appreciate the heads up on the updated apis!\n",
