    "body": "This is a Windows problem not a PowerShell problem. Local users/groups have their real name changed in localized versions of Windows, that's why even if you install an English language pack the group names keep their localized name. If you want to do something with the built-in groups you need to use their wellknown SIDs. This also prevents you from running into issues on systems where people have manually renamed the groups/users.  \r\nAs for the firewall displayname, I think it uses the MUI files for the current language to get the name and even if you could force it to use English, you would still need to actually install those language files.",
