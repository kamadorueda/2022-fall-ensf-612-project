    "body": "Trying to get ahead of our Committee meeting today. Given the complexity of this code, I'm not sure I can validate that it equals the Committee's conclusion on what we wanted to do with `PSModulePath`, but I'm trusting that it meets what we decided on.\r\n\r\nOn the question around whether it's okay for 6's PSHome to stay in the value when launching 7 from 6: I'm also with @iSazonov here. 6.2 is going to EOL 6 months after 7.0 GAs, and I don't expect many people to be launching 7 from 6. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I'd like whatever breakage we have in that scenario to not be catastrophic, and I don't see 7's PSHome being *added* to the PSModulePath in the screenshot you gave above. Obviously, this behavior isn't happening in the existing 7 preview build, but when I add 6's PSHome to my 7 preview PSModulePath, 7 appears to take precedence in autoloading, but I really just smoke tested it:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\jaiello> $env:psmodulepath\r\nC:\\Users\\jaiello\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules;C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\Modules;c:\\program files\\powershell\\7-preview\\Modules;C:\\program files\\powershell\\6\\Modules;C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\r\nC:\\Users\\jaiello> $psversiontable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18959\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0â€¦}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm no expert on the module loading precedence, but it'd probably be a good idea if we revved up PSHome's 6.1.0.0 modules to 7.0.0.0 for our 7 release:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    Directory: C:\\program files\\powershell\\7-preview\\Modules\r\n\r\nModuleType Version    Name                                PSEdition ExportedCommands\r\n---------- -------    ----                                --------- ----------------\r\nManifest   6.1.0.0    CimCmdlets                          Core      {Get-CimAssociatedInstance, Get-CimClass, Get-CimInstance, Get-CimSessionâ€¦}\r\nManifest   1.2.3.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive        Desk      {Compress-Archive, Expand-Archive}\r\nManifest   6.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics    Core      {Get-WinEvent, New-WinEvent}\r\nManifest   6.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Host           Core      {Start-Transcript, Stop-Transcript}\r\nManifest   6.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Management     Core      {Add-Content, Clear-Content, Clear-ItemProperty, Join-Pathâ€¦}\r\nManifest   6.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Security       Core      {Get-Acl, Set-Acl, Get-PfxCertificate, Get-Credentialâ€¦}\r\nManifest   6.1.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility        Core      {Export-Alias, Get-Alias, Import-Alias, New-Aliasâ€¦}\r\nManifest   6.1.0.0    Microsoft.WSMan.Management          Core      {Disable-WSManCredSSP, Enable-WSManCredSSP, Get-WSManCredSSP, Set-WSManQuickConfigâ€¦}\r\nScript     1.4.3      PackageManagement                   Desk      {Find-Package, Get-Package, Get-PackageProvider, Get-PackageSourceâ€¦}\r\nScript     2.2        PowerShellGet                       Desk      {Find-Command, Find-DSCResource, Find-Module, Find-RoleCapabilityâ€¦}\r\nScript     2.0        PSDesiredStateConfiguration         Core      {Configuration, Get-DscResource}\r\nScript     6.1.0.0    PSDiagnostics                       Core      {Disable-PSTrace, Disable-PSWSManCombinedTrace, Disable-WSManTrace, Enable-PSTraceâ€¦}\r\nScript     2.0.0      PSReadLine                          Desk      {Get-PSReadLineKeyHandler, Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler, Remove-PSReadLineKeyHandler, Get-PSReadLineOptionâ€¦}\r\nBinary     2.0.1      ThreadJob                           Desk      Start-ThreadJob\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn any case, we'll discuss our meeting today.
