I don't think it is obvious which one and would always put `@(\"A\",\"B\")  + @(\"C\",\"D\")` or `\"A\", (\"B\" + \"C\"), \"D\",`  although only the latter version is required. \r\nTo be honest I when someone says, \"What I want to write needs () in it and I think that what I didn't want to write should be the version that needs them\" it never gets anywhere. \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

I will attempt to bring this back to the intent of my post, and I ask that you do the same.\r\n\r\nI'm challenging that this is _not_ intended behavior regardless of how long it has been this way. I'm basing this on one of the examples I provided not matching the others:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$a, $b = @(\r\n    0,\r\n    2*5-1\r\n)\r\n$a; $b\r\n\r\n$a, $b = @(\r\n    0\r\n    2*5-1\r\n)\r\n$a; $b\r\n```\r\nThose _should_, (in my opinion informed by exposure to many programming languages that offer similar functionality) be the same and _should_ (in my opinion informed by exposure to many programming languages that offer similar functionality) provide the result:\r\n\r\n```text\r\n0\r\n9\r\n0\r\n9\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnyone new to PowerShell would have a reasonable expectation (in my opinion informed by exposure to many programming languages that offer similar functionality) that `2*5-1` would be evaluated before being inserted into the array and _would not_ have a reasonable expectation  (in my opinion informed by exposure to many programming languages that offer similar functionality) that it would be treated as performing duplication and attempted subtraction of an array.\r\n\r\nThis language can and has changed and evolved. Breaking changes with significant consequences can and have been made regardless of the effort. I do not wish to surrender to argumentum ad antiquitatem and appeals to complexity. I wish to improve the language so that users (new and experienced) can fall into pits of success.\r\n\r\nIn the best-case scenario, this behavior _is_ changed to be more user-friendly and intuitive. At worse, the documentation will be updated to reflect this behavior more clearly.",

    "body": "I'm not sure how well you understand the role of @() , and line break. \r\nTry, \r\n```\r\n$x =  @(\r\nhostname\r\nwhoami\r\n$psversiontable.\r\n os\r\n)\r\n```\r\nNotice there is a a line break between  the member operator and the member name.   Like other operators the  ,  can be followed by LF or CR/LF \r\n\r\nYour example \r\n```\r\n$a, $b = @(\r\n    0,\r\n    2*5-1\r\n)\r\n```\r\nShows that you can insert line breaks into  `@(0, 2*5-1 )`   (Where, incidentally the `@()`  is redundant) it doesn't matter whether you write `4,3*2+1` OR \r\n```\r\n4,\r\n3*\r\n2+\r\n1 \r\n```\r\nThey are the same statement with different white space.  And without the comma\r\n```\r\n    0\r\n    2*5-1\r\n``` \r\nAre two values  which become an array by wrapping in `@().`  My example  won't work as `$x = hostname, whoami` : to remove the line break between the statements needs a semi-colon - a comma would cause an error. \r\n\r\n**You're saying that**  `0,1*2`  **and** `@(0;1*2)`  **should arrive at the same result** - the former by how it groups one expression and the latter by processing two expressions.  That's not how it works, but it isn't an unreasonable thing to believe. \r\n \r\nWe can trade years of experience and number of languages used. TBH most of the languages I've used didn't treat a comma separated list without any begin/end markers as an array. And back when I did my computer science degree we were taught that overloaded operators were bad, so+ should not be _both_ concatenation and arithmetic.  Given that 1,2,3,4 -gt 2 applies the greater than operator to all 4 array members,  my computer science lecturers would probably say 1,2,3,4  + 5 should return 6,7,8,9.  And the chances of _that_ change ever being made would be Zero.  \r\n \r\nOff the top of my head I can't say which languages treat `0,1*2` ,  `(0,1) * 2` and `0, (1*2)` all as legal ways to get an array/list/set.  What someone coming to PowerShell _expects_ would be shaped by other languages they have used, so I wouldn't like to say what the _most common_ expectation is. As above I think there are multiple expectations which are reasonable, but only one can be what actually happens. And I'm not sure even  PowerShell experts would always correctly predict the result of\r\n```\r\n\"A\" + \"B\", \"C\" -join \"D\" + \"E\"\r\n```\r\nThe 4 operations can arranged in 24 sequences (4!)  all are possible: whether you want    \r\n`(((\"A\" + \"B\"), \"C\") -join \"D\") + \"E\"`     \r\nor `\"A\" + (\"B\", \"C\" -join (\"D\" + \"E\"))`       \r\nor `(\"A\" + (\"B\",\"C\")) -Join (\"D\" +\"E) `      \r\nyou can write it that way and _even if the way you want happens to be default_ I would say you should include the brackets for clarity  \r\n\r\nThe more time that passes with the language working one way, the more scripts there are which depend on that way of working and the greater the cost of changing. You're not talking about a change which would stop scripts running in all affected cases, but one that can result in different data being modified / deleted on  different versions of PowerShell. It would lead to \"Upgrading to  Version X corrupted our data\" experiences when what you see as wrong is (a) by design and (b) fixed by putting () in the right place. \r\n\r\n",
