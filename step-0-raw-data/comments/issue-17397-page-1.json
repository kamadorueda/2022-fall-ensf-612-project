    "body": "I think this is more of an issue with the module `NetSecurity`, which uses the partial type name `boolean`. The `System` namespace will be tried out by default in PowerShell, and that's why running `Import-Module NetSecurity` will work. But once you introduce a new namespace which contains another `Boolean` definition, the type name `boolean` itself becomes ambiguous and hence the error message.",
