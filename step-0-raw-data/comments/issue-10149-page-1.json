While I appreciate it's perhaps not ideal for you, I don't think that exaggerating the issue is perhaps the best way to get something done about it. 😕\r\n\r\nPowerShell has a bit of a disadvantage there when it comes to comparing it with other shells, partially because it utilizes .NET's libraries. While there are things we can do to limit startup memory usage, some of those libraries we need to work with are surprisingly large.\r\n\r\nI do, however, agree that idle memory usage is a fairly reproducible issue, especially if we're talking right after startup. Scripts / code that is run after that may cause additional libraries to be loaded, and I'm not sure if .NET Core has quite gotten library _unloading_ sorted out completely -- and from what I've read I think there would need to be improvements in the engine to support unloading of unused libraries as well.",
