I suspect that the problem is with this in your configuration:\r\n```powershell\r\nGroupManagedServiceAccount = 'domain\\gMSA'\r\n```\r\nBoth SecretManagement and SecretStore are designed to install and run under user accounts.  Windows virtual and managed accounts are different from normal user accounts, and SecretManagement/SecretStore will likely not run correctly under them.  I wanted to eventually update these modules to optionally install and run at 'machine' scope, so that they would run under these kinds of accounts.  But there has been no funding for this yet, sadly.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that transcriptions ended after 'Get-Secret' because a terminating error ended the session.\r\nUnfortunately, there is no workaround other than doing the work needed to run under these kinds of managed accounts.",

    "body": "Unfortunately, I am not able to repro this since I cannot get a set-up with gMSA accounts.  But I looked at the code and PowerShell will only write the transcript epilog (other than when calling Stop-Transcript explicitly) when it thinks all session runspaces are closed.  SecretManagement loads and runs extension vaults in separate runspaces for isolation, and I am thinking some non-terminating error is causing the extension vault runspaces to be recreated, which in turn is somehow triggering transcription to end.  I know this is speculative, but it is all I have for now.\r\n\r\nIn general I think we can say that SecretManagement/SecretStore is not supported for non-standard accounts (such as virtual or gMSA accounts).  At some point I want to upgrade both modules to support 'AllUsers' or machine wide scope operation, but that may not happen soon as we don't currently have resources to allocate for the work.",
