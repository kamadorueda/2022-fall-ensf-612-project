    "body": "> Why would you want to, that would mean you have a blank window with no output. When you redirect a std pipe in a process you cause that output to no longer appear. You would have to somehow split the output to go to a pipe you can capture but also have it output to the console at the same time which isnâ€™t really easy to do at all.\r\n\r\n@mklement0 @jhoneill \r\nAfaik (i'm new to PS so i might be wrong), the window would be blank only if all of the streams with any output are redirected.\r\nBut for example i have a simple program that writes to streams # 1, 2, 3 and 6 (`write-host`) and i need just one of those streams redirected to a variable. ATM i can do it by using a support file via `-RedirectStandardOutput` or `-RedirectStandardError`...\r\nAgain, if you're wondering why i _need_ `start-process`, it is simply to open a new window. Why? for example because the original process has no window (because it has been started by another c# program with `.StartInfo.WindowStyle = ProcessWindowStyle.Hidden`)\r\n\r\nAnd now that i think about it, this can work only for streams 1/2, number 3-6 are unmanageable. Even with a syntactic sugar like `$stdout = my.exe args 6>variable:stdinfo`, you couldnt apply this to `start-process`.",

    "body": "@aetonsi, yes, when you call a script via the PowerShell CLI, the stdout and stderr streams are the only ones available, as with any child process. By default, PowerShell only sends its error stream to stderr (curiously, only when stderr is _redirected_), all others (success output, warnings, verbose messages, ...) are output to stdout (which is problematic - see #7989)\r\n\r\nThe only way to distinguish between PowerShell's [output streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_Output_Streams) via a [CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_Pwsh) call would be to use `-OutputFormat xml` in order to receive CLIXML data _via stdout_ (CLIXML is an XML-based object-serialization format). Deserializing this data with `[System.Management.Automation.PSSerializer]::Deserialize()`, would allow you to separate the deserialized objects into their streams of origin by their type.\r\n\r\nIn other words: this approach indeed would leave your window invariably blank, because _all_ output would be communicated via stdout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
