We need a way to inform the user to go to some documentation on ps remoting (likely something like https://aka.ms/pswsmanremoting) to inform of the limitations and even suggest using PSWSMan as a workaround (or moving to SSH as a preferred solution).\r\n\r\n@PowerShell/wg-powershell-remoting please discuss on where in the code it would be best to inform the user to get a plugin that supports WSMan and how PowerShell can detect that appropriate plugin\r\n",

Remoting plugins only affect WinRM connections, and the common user has no idea what it is or for.  I feel the only work that is necessary is to throw an appropriate error when a WinRM cmdlet/parameter set is invoked on non-Windows platforms that do not support WinRM remoting.  We can eventually include in the error message something that directs the user to a custom remote connection that does support non-Windows platform connection to WinRM endpoints, when one becomes available.",
