And there are minor costs - an extra pointer that is never used isn't free - it requires more memory and extra time in garbage collection checking if the (usually null) value needs collecting.\r\n\r\nValidateNotNullOrEmpty stands out as one example where I wouldn't bother. ValidateDrive is also probably not worth it.\r\n\r\nAnd last - I can see a custom error message being useful on ValidateRange, e.g. to say the value should be a positive value or whatever, but if we go that route, we need localization support similar to HelpMessageBaseName and HelpMessageResourceId in ParameterAttribute.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo using the `ValidateRange` example, I would rather we add `ValidatePositive` and `ValidateNonNegative` attributes so that nobody has to worry about localization and is not tempted to use `ValidateRange` with the `ErrorMessage` property.\r\n\r\nAs for guessing - Intellisense does a good job completing property names in attributes, so I don't think it's a big problem.",

    "body": "Thanks for that. Looking at the set of built-in attributes more closely, I now see how there's not much benefit in allowing custom messages for the remaining ones (doing so would also be complicated by several attributes reporting one of _several_ messages).\r\n\r\nIn that vein:\r\n\r\n* I hadn't noticed that `ValidateSetAttribute` was also given an `ErrorMessage` property - it seems like a prime candidate for _not_ needing that.\r\n\r\n* Conversely, \r\n\r\n  * `ValidateLength` deserves an analogous makeover to `ValidateCount`'s (#3585):\r\n      * distinguish only 2 cases: min. and max. length being equal, and being outside the range\r\n      * the current messages are quite pleonastic (I'm in the mood for big words) and prescriptive; e.g.: `The character length of the 3 argument is too long. Shorten the character length of the argument so it is fewer than or equal \r\nto \"2\" characters, and then try the command again`\r\n\r\n   * Similarly, `ValidateRange` should probably have only a _single_ (built-in) outside-the-range error message (a min == max case doesn't make sense here).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> nobody has to worry about localization\r\n\r\nGiven that we'll have (at least) 2 attributes that _do_ support custom error messages - `ValidateScriptAttribute` and `ValidatePatternAttribute` - isn't the localization can of worms / gusanos / Würmer / vers  already open?\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.: The link to the specific comment in the other thread worked this time.",
