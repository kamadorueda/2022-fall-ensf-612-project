My scheduled task runs under the `SYSTEM` context in Windows which means when the scheduled task runs, it can't find any user-created repository so the `Find-Module` command was working as expected.\r\n\r\nI was testing an auto-updating feature of my PowerShell module and didn't want to post many updates to PS Gallery (as per the guidance about avoiding this behavior). Once I published my module for the first time to PSG, my auto-update function worked as desired.\r\n\r\n[There is a feature request covering this matter.](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/214)",
