It may have been misguided to add those aliases in the first place, but the design decision was consistent with other Unix commands, e.g. the Windows PowerShell aliases `ps` or `ls` certainly don't work like the native tools.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that we need to weigh the pros and cons of removing them. We also look bad when we break people's scripts that work as they expect today. That's why we have an RFC process to do the right thing for all of our users.\n\nAfter going through an RFC - we may learn that removing _all_ of our Unix aliases is the right thing to do. Or maybe just removing `curl` and `wget`.\n\nIt's also possible we end up with getting the best of both worlds - we find a way to invoke the native commands if they exist, but fall back to the aliases otherwise. This certainly has it's own set of problems.  For example, if the native command exists, but the script really did want the alias, can we detect that?\n\nThe bottom line here is that we really want to do the right thing for _all_ of our customers, starting with where we are today.\n",

Both work natively on Windows without things like cygwin or the new GNU/Linux emulator.\n\nI will go so far as to say that there is no point in worrying about this being a \"breaking change\" because nobody uses \"curl\" or \"wget\" to mean Invoke-WebRequest, which doesn't support any of the command line options of either utility. If anything, the current implementation break scripts, removing these \"aliases\" would not break anything, but more likely than not would fix scripts.\n\nBy current \"governance\", this would fall under \"Changes that don't require an RFC\"\n",

Aliases like these if you come from the unix world would never have been built in.\n\nThey break stuff and creates an amount of weirdness and forces many users to use workarounds like this: http://superuser.com/questions/883914/how-do-i-permanently-remove-a-default-powershell-alias\n\nI use that on a couple of machines but that also means that my scripts wont work on others unless they do the same.  And stuff like this also creates guides like this: http://www.powertheshell.com/bp_script_alias/  that says dont use aliases in scripts.  And that is what i prefer myself. That way a script always works regardless of what machine i use it on. \n",

The story as I see it is that a few years ago you decided to usurp the names of some well known tools, in the full knowledge that doing so would break those tools. You have then ignored bug reports about this for _years_. You really can't deny that you knew a long time ago that what you did amounted to hostile behaviour towards other people.\n\nIf removing these aliases (retroactively, if you want to clean up your act you have to remove this from _all_ versions in which this was ever released) breaks things for some people, then you can go and send people out to help them fix their issues. You _knew_ it was a hostile action, _you_ broke things, _you_ fix them.\n",

Those were the business practices of Microsoft 10+ years ago, to take over entire corporations. Are they doing it here? Possibly, but unlikely. But they have not embraced, extended, nor extinguished in a _long_ time. I implore you to find an example of this behavior in the past ten years. I'm not trying to make this about computer company politics, and it would be foolish for anyone so deeply involved in open source to welcome Microsoft with open, trusting arms. They have been known to bite, and open source has (and still is) been bitten before. But bringing up company politics does not address the technical issue at hand.\n\nThere's been a lot of unproductive Microsoft bashing in this thread. Sorry to call you out specifically, but I'm really more interested in reading about solutions to this problem rather than getting angry at the original developer.\n",

    "body": "This is how embracing and extinguishing Linux/Unix works. Just hijack all command names accumulated for more than 40 years in the body and soul of the Unix system. What should be next, what would do most damage to users that are for the first time looking to use Windows as another quasi Unix machine. How about cut, grep, diff, find? The solution using 'Remove Item-Alias:curl' and 'Remove Item-Alias:wget' are the most appropiate to fix it temporarily, but it should be the other way around, like: 'Add Item-Alias:wget:microsoft-wget' if we need to add commands replaced, in a honest way, by Microsoft. Thanks and please disregard any words that seem harsh.\n",

Linux users have better ones, Windows users can't rely on them (too much RAM, to little features).

In fact they are actually cross-platform tools which happen to be widely used and commonly available on Linux distros. \n\nCurl is probably one of the most cross-platform packages there is, it's available for pretty much any OS you can name, including VMS, Irix, and DOS. \n\nIt's unfortunate that this happened, but Microsoft is an oil tanker, not a speedboat. It's impossible for them to do anything quickly, due to simple inertia. \n\nI'm irritated by this problem too, but we need to stay civil and focus on the situation, not the people trying to solve it.\n",

The right thing on linux is **already done**. This change is windows-only.\n",

So, AFAIK, you can't just run ELF binaries directly from cmd, nor can you start Windows processes from Bash. And certainly, PowerShell aliases are going to be limited to PowerShell sessions. \n\nI don't think these PowerShell aliases are going to cause any problems for people using WSL. And I could be wrong, but I don't think the ELF binaries will be available directly from PowerShell. \n",

    "body": "@moshev that's actually an interesting way of handling things. I usually personally prefer to go the route of careful and planned deprecation then removal. There is certainly a case to be made for backwards compatibility and maybe that's the route to go for powershell.\n\nWhat you're basically proposing is akin to api versioning. An interesting idea. I personally favour deprecation in part because I like deleting code, and over time it lessens the burden of maintenance. Microsoft not being me probably has the resources to handle a lot of that maintenance so maybe for them it wouldn't be a big deal.\n\nStill, no API should have to live with it's mistakes eternally. There are responsible ways for Microsoft to remove the aliases that aren't going to cause horrifying harm to their user base; this thread really should be about the options for fixing this problem. There is an awful lot of anger and suspicion here which seems kind of pointless. Also sometimes I think people just don't like having their ideas shot down. Learn the important parts of being a developer:\n1. Learn from others ideas \n2. Your needs and/or ideas are not paramount\n3. You don't speak for everyone\n4. You're not the best (unless you really somehow are)\n5. Don't get attached to your code\n",
