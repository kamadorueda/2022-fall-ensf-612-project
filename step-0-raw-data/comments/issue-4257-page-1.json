    "body": "Let me describe how I understand how `@()` work.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have this:\r\n```powershell\r\n$Result = @(\r\n    some statements here\r\n)\r\n```\r\nIt is more or less equivalent to:\r\n```powershell\r\n. {\r\n    some statements here\r\n} | ForEach-Object -Begin { $Temp = [Collections.ArrayList]::new() } -Process { [void]$Temp.Add($_) } -End { $Result = $Temp.ToArray() }\r\n```\r\nSo `@()` invoke provided statements, collect all the pipeline output and create array from them. Notice: it absolutely does not care what kind of objects (scalar, array or some other collection) you write into pipeline, and that is where great power of `@()` is.\r\n\r\n_Note special case: `@(<array literal>)`. I think that in this case `@()` is eliminated as optimization, but that leads to incorrect, IMHO, result, when `<array literal>` is typed. `@([int[]] (1, 2)).GetType().Name` return `Int32[]` instead of `Object[]`._\r\n\r\nHow is that useful? It is useful when you work with arrays of arrays (jagged arrays in .NET terms). Suppose you have following command:\r\n```powershell\r\n$Result = Get-Content File -ReadCount 3\r\n```\r\nIf you have 9 lines in `File`, then result will be `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` (array of arrays). But if have only 3 lines, then result will be `[1, 2, 3]`, but not `[[1, 2, 3]]`. What if you always want to have array of arrays, regardless of number of lines in `File`? Simple solution:\r\n```powershell\r\n$Result = @(Get-Content File -ReadCount 3)\r\n```\r\nOther example: suppose you want to filter array of rows (arrays) by some condition, and then find how many are actually satisfy condition.\r\n```powershell\r\n$Array = (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)\r\n$Result = $Array | Where-Object { $_[1]%2 }\r\n$Result.Count # 3\r\n```\r\nThat is how to do it right:\r\n```powershell\r\n$Array = (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9)\r\n$Result = @($Array | Where-Object { $_[1]%2 })\r\n$Result.Count # 1\r\n```\r\nThe same apply on any other transformation of array of rows, for example [sorting](https://stackoverflow.com/q/40954626). `@()` make this cases work especially because it wrap single array wrote into pipeline into another single element array, which other methods, like casting to `[Array]`, did not do.\r\n\r\nSo, how does `@(New-Object 'Object[]' 2)` different from `@($Array | Where-Object { $_[1]%2 })` from above? Right answer: them does not different, both write array into pipeline as single object, and it got wrapped by `@()` operator, because it is what that operator do.",

    "body": "@PetSerAl: Thanks for the background info and the helpful examples.\r\n\r\nFirst, let me say that my example is obviously contrived and this issue may rarely, if ever, arise in the real world - of course, if you're explicitly constructing an array / collection, wrapping it in `@()` is pointless.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples I'll use something _other_ than an array for illustration, namely an _empty_ `[System.Collections.ArrayList]` instance.\r\n\r\nIf I understand you correctly, you're saying that:\r\n\r\nThe equivalent of this _cmdlet_-based statement:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Yields an [object[]] array whose 1 item is the empty array list.\r\n@(New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList)   \r\n```\r\n\r\nis the following _expression_-based statement:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# To get the same result with an expression, the [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new() \r\n# call must be wrapped in an array(!).\r\n@(, [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis equivalence in itself is puzzling - why wouldn't the equivalent be just `@([System.Collections.ArrayList]::new())`, without the wrapper array?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that there's **no good _conceptual_ reason for `New-Object` to wrap the instance created in an outer, single-element array** when writing to the pipeline - but, if I understand you correctly, **doing so is a _technical necessity_**, because the collection instance would otherwise invariably be converted to `System.Object[]` on output, correct?\r\n\r\nHere's another example of where the distinction is puzzling, at least to those not intimately familiar with the inner workings of PowerShell, and taking that perspective (as someone who has _some_ understanding of them) was the reason for creating this issue:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Yields *1*, because the *wrapped* empty array list is sent through the pipeline.\r\nNew-Object System.Collections.ArrayList | Measure-Object | % Count \r\n\r\n# Yields *0*, because the empty array list itself is enumerated:\r\n[System.Collections.ArrayList]::new() | Measure-Object | % Count\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe fact that **`(...)` causes unwrapping of _pipeline_ output** is also far from obvious:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Now yields *0*, because the (...) forces unwrapping.\r\n(New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList) | Measure-Object | % Count \r\n```\r\n\r\nIncidentally, that makes inspecting the true output generated by `New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList` all but impossible:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# -InputObject must be used to inspect collections (using the pipeline would unwrap),\r\n# but the unavoidable use of (...) unwraps too.\r\nGet-Member -InputObject (New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList)\r\n\r\n# Storing in a variable doesn't help, because the assignment unwraps too.\r\n$al = New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList\r\nGet-Member -InputObject $al\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGiven that this seemingly comes down to the fundamentals of pipeline behavior, there's probably nothing that can be done - except perhaps consider including the findings in a collection of yet-to-be-created advanced help topics.\r\n\r\nUnless someone thinks that an actionable change is warranted here, I'll close this issue soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It does not wrap `ArrayList` into something, because it just not necessary for cmdlets.\r\n>Here's another example of where the distinction is puzzling, at least to those not intimately familiar with the inner workings of PowerShell, and taking that perspective (as someone who has *some* understanding of them) was the reason for creating this issue:\r\n>```powershell\r\n># Yields *1*, because the *wrapped* empty array list is sent through the pipeline.\r\n>New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList | Measure-Object | % Count\r\n>\r\n># Yields *0*, because the empty array list itself is enumerated:\r\n>[System.Collections.ArrayList]::new() | Measure-Object | % Count\r\n>```\r\n\r\nSame distinction: *command* vs. *expression*:\r\n```powershell\r\n{\r\n    New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList | Measure-Object | % Count\r\n}.Ast.EndBlock.Statements[0].PipelineElements[0].GetType().Name\r\n{\r\n    [System.Collections.ArrayList]::new() | Measure-Object | % Count\r\n}.Ast.EndBlock.Statements[0].PipelineElements[0].GetType().Name\r\n```\r\n>The fact that **`(...)` causes unwrapping of *pipeline* output** is also far from obvious:\r\n>```powershell\r\n># Now yields *0*, because the (...) forces unwrapping.\r\n>(New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList) | Measure-Object | % Count\r\n>```\r\nParenthesis `(...)` do not cause unwrapping. Them transform `command` into `expression`:\r\n```powershell\r\n{\r\n    (New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList) | Measure-Object | % Count\r\n}.Ast.EndBlock.Statements[0].PipelineElements[0].GetType().Name\r\n```\r\nAnd because that expression used as first element in pipeline, that cause unwrapping.\r\n>Incidentally, that makes inspecting the true output generated by `New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList` all but impossible:\r\n\r\nIn my opinion *true output* of `New-Object System.Collections.ArrayList` is an `ArrayList` instance, and both your commands show members of it.\r\n>PowerShell has no array literals\r\n```powershell\r\n{ 1, 2, 3 }.Ast.EndBlock.Statements[0].PipelineElements[0].Expression.GetType().Name\r\n```\r\n>I have no real opinion, but why do you think it is incorrect?\r\n>\r\n>Because `@()` should consistently create `System.Object[]` arrays?\r\n\r\nYes, I think it should be always `System.Object[]`. Also:\r\n```powershell\r\n{ @([int[]] (1, 2, 3)) }.Ast.EndBlock.Statements[0].PipelineElements[0].Expression.StaticType\r\n```\r\n>What's the harm in keeping the specific type?\r\n```powershell\r\n@([int[]] (1, 2, 3))[1] = 'Not int'\r\n```",

    "body": "Great discussions!!!\r\n\r\n@PetSerAl is right, PowerShell unravels collection results from expressions, but not commands.\r\nCommands themselves decide whether the result writen to pipe should be unravelled or not (`Cmdlet.WriteObject(object)` and `Cmdlet.WriteObject(object, enumerateCollection)` for C# and `Write-Output` and `Write-Output -NoEnumerate` for script).\r\n\r\nAs for the quote, here is more context on it:\r\n> Most programming languages have some kind of array literal notation similar to the PowerShell hash literal notation (`@{...}`), where there's a beginning character sequence followed by a list of values, followed by a closing character sequence. Here’s how array literals are defined in PowerShell: They’re not. **There’s no array literal notation in PowerShell**. […] instead of having array literals, there’s a set of operations that create collections as needed.\r\n\r\nI think the point is that you don't need a notation (beginning char sequence + closing char sequence) to create an array in PowerShell, for example, `1,2,3,4` is defining an array. But PowerShell does have [`ArrayLiteralRule`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/Parser.cs#L5990) in parser and [`ArrayLiteralAst`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/ast.cs#L9278).\r\n\r\n> The situation changes with a cast\r\n\r\nThe `ArrayLiteralAst` is embedded in the `ConvertExpressionAst`:\r\n```powershell\r\n{ [int[]] (1, 2, 3) }.Ast.EndBlock.Statements[0].PipelineElements[0].Expression.Child.Pipeline.PipelineElements[0\r\n].Expression.GetType().Name\r\nArrayLiteralAst\r\n```",

But I don't think the array expression in powershell language is defined to always return a new array object.\r\n\r\n> Is not ArrayExpressionAst.StaticType should be adjusted to match current behavior?\r\n\r\nGood catch. It is inconsistent and should be fixed. But IMHO, the fix should be to change `ArrayExpressionAst.StaticType` to always return `System.Array` (also a breaking change :)). `StaticType` is by definition not accurate, because sometimes the actual type can be known only at runtime, for example, `BinaryExpressionAst.StaticType` returns `System.Object` when it's `-bor`, and the actual type may vary at runtime.",
