Your suggestion is the sensible place between the current \"Treat everything with a # as a type even if is malformed\" and what I took the OP as suggesting (which he probably didn't mean) of \"Ignore #Type even when well formed\". It's a very unlikely breaker. It is far, far, more likely that something depends on the default behaviour of Windows PowerShell writing #Type  and produces invalid data files on 6 and 7 - and _that_ was considered low enough risk, and changing sufficiently obviously right and doable  that it went ahead. \r\n",
