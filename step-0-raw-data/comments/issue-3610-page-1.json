I understand that it can be difficult to retrain muscle memory (I'm having trouble myself), but being explicit with what your asking the shell to give you is almost always going to give you a better experience than relying on aliases which were not originally intended for your platform. The decision to remove these aliases has not removed any functionality in PowerShell, but only changed the way the commands need to be invoked.\r\n\r\n`ls` certainly falls into a grey area, as it's a built-in in both PowerShell and Bash, but in the case of commands such as `curl`, `wget`, etc. which mask functionality that already exists on the system, I don't think there was really any question of what the \"correct\" behavior is, only the least disruptive. There was no solution that was going to be ideal for everyone. At least with this solution you will have an easy option to re-enable the aliases you wish to have in your environment.",
