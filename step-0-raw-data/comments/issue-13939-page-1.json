    "body": "So I think the problem lies in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/7e145ef2da91f2ac49e9a4d4a988f309a02007ad/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L173.\r\n\r\nWhen the FileSystemProvider is given a path it tries to normalise it which involves a few steps like converting file system separators from the alt to the actual separator. The current code is designed to get the actual casing of the path item, so if you did `Get-Item -Path C:\\WinDowS | Select Name, FullName' it will be `Windows` and not the one specified in the cmdlet parameter.\r\n\r\nThe trouble in this case is that `[IO.Directory]::GetFileSystemEntries('D:\\ca', 'hh')` is case insensitive on Windows regardless of the folder settings and it will return both folders, for example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\temp\\ca> gci\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\temp\\ca\r\n\r\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                 -------------         ------ ----\r\nd----          30/10/2020 11:31 AM                HH\r\nd----          30/10/2020 11:31 AM                hh\r\n\r\nPS C:\\temp\\ca> [IO.Directory]::GetFileSystemEntries('C:\\temp\\ca', 'hh')\r\nC:\\temp\\ca\\HH\r\nC:\\temp\\ca\\hh\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow when `GetFileSystemEntries` returns 1 or more elements the current code just returns the first one, in your case `HH` https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/7e145ef2da91f2ac49e9a4d4a988f309a02007ad/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L174-L177.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like we need a more stringent check when multiple elements are returned here. I'm not sure if this code path is also meant to handle wildcard in the path but it does explain this issue. While the code has changed a bit, the use of normalising the path was introduced with https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/6bc2b55fdf99bf70cf11bbc2a37ffa20aa9881d5 and  part of the 7.0.0 release.",
