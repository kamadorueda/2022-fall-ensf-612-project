In which case most definitely a bug in the code because multiple threads being kicked off when idle is not good programming practice. ",

    "body": "This is discussed at length in the linked issue. Dotnet's cryptography provider prefers libssl-1.0.0 if it's present on disk and then falls back to 1.0.2. The [fix](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/pull/27208) merged in just three days ago, and PowerShell hasn't taken the update yet. Since it's a weekend and a holiday today, that's not terribly surprising.\r\n\r\nOnce dotnet is updated and PSCore moves to that new version, it'll load 1.0.2 first and respect the environment variable `CLR_OPENSSL_VERSION_OVERRIDE`.\r\n\r\nEDIT: It's being loaded twice because dotnet prefers 1.0.0, but dotnet also loads libcurl. curl has been linked to 1.0.2 and so both get loaded. OpenSSL is one of the more problematic versioned library dependencies as libraries on Linux go.",
