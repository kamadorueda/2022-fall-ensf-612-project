    "body": "This would also help with scenarios where a COM object implements multiple interfaces but `IDispatch` only reports the members of the \"main\" interface.\r\n\r\nSee [this StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/q/63501159/1930135) for a real world example.  PowerShell's method binder lets you specify explicit interface implementations by casting the expression e.g. `([IList[string]]$obj).Add($item)`.  Assuming this logic will apply to COM objects, this would be a potentially easy way to enable utilizing COM interfaces like `Process2`.\r\n\r\ncc @daxian-dbw ",
