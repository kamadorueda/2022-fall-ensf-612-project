    "body": "@markekraus Sample Use Case:\r\n\r\nI have a base (effectively abstract) class, `Fetcher`.  Classes `SqlFetcher` and `RestFetcher` extend this class, providing methods for pulling data from SQL or from Rest services.  This then allows me to write functions to gather data which don't care about the technology.   i.e. These functions take an instance of a `Fetcher` class, initialised to point at the relevant database or web service.  \r\n\r\nWhen I call the class's method `GetData()` it gathers and returns this data to the pipeline.  However, there are filters which can only be applied in PowerShell (e.g. they rely on a regex; a query type not possible in the other languages), so after getting the results I need to filter them.  I only need the first match; so if this match is in the first 10 results returned I don't want to incur the expense of returning all 1,000 results of the query I sent to `Fetcher`.",

SQL's done the work of determining which results to return, but if we're using a SqlDataReader (i.e. as opposed to a SqlDataAdapter), then we only need to fetch those values back from the server row by row.  In a scenario where I knew I may not require all results I'd opt for the data reader over the adapter.\r\n\r\nFor the REST example; fair enough you'd need to get the full result before parsing it...  However if I amend the use case to mention that the service we're calling requires paging then it's once again a valid use case; since we avoid the round trip every N (page size) records.\r\n\r\nNo worries with the suggestion being debated; completely agree that requirements should be justifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
