We cannot assume that just because the URL for first page, previous page, and last page is the same as the next page that we are looping needlessly. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nnext https://api.contoso.com/v2/batch/report?id=4f45db04-6517-4de6-88fc-924a807dc578\r\nfirst https://api.contoso.com/v2/batch/report?id=4f45db04-6517-4de6-88fc-924a807dc578\r\nlast https://api.contoso.com/v2/batch/report?id=4f45db04-6517-4de6-88fc-924a807dc578\r\nprev next https://api.contoso.com/v2/batch/report?id=4f45db04-6517-4de6-88fc-924a807dc578\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe API returns the same `next` link multiple times until the entire batch has been grabbed. When the entire batch is complete, no `next` link is returned. This decreases processing as the backend may not have a page count or it may not be possible to obtain a page count. The batch may be forward-only processing so no `prev` is supplied nor possible.\r\n\r\nIf your API is supplying a next page and there is no next page, then using `-FollowRelLink` may not be the best solution. You may have to do your own looping:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Pages = do {\r\n    $Response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Uri\r\n    $Response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json\r\n} while ($Response.RelationLink.Next -ne $Response.RelationLink.Last)\r\n```\r\n```",

    "body": "@white-bee As said, when there is no next page, an API does not normally provide a `next` link. You have hit an edge case that is, as I understand it anyway, and incorrect use of the `next` link. There really is nothing we can realistically do to prevent that. Decreasing the default `-MaximumFollowRelLink` would break the Principle of Least Astonishment and we can't make any assumptions about links matching. We are at the mercy of API authors to follow RFCs and best practices.\r\n\r\nAs a general API access rule, one should avoid grabbing all pages blindly. Best practice would be to pull in X number of pages at a time. There are other scenarios where grabbing all pages can lead to unexpected results and API throttling. In my own code, I batch pull no more than 10 pages at a time even when I need to pull all pages. In that case, I would recommend always supplying a `-MaximumFollowRelLink`.",

    "body": "@KevinMarquette That's not the default experience, as I understand it. This is the first I've heard of an API returning a `next` link when there is no next page. I believe that is is an edge case or I have been really lucky with the many APIs I work with not doing this.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, I didn't design this API and it was added before I was active in the project. If I had designed it or been around when it was being designed, I probably would have recommended `-FollowRelLink` be an not-null-int and not even included `-MaximumFollowRelLink` to avoid the confusion and surprises. That would have also enforced best practices of grabbing results in batches instead of everything at once. \r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Pages = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $uri -FollowRelLink 10\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, since the max count is now separate from enabling the behavior, the default mode of most commands is to return everything when there is no filter or limit present. So stopping at X pages would be unexpected if the user was unaware of `-MaximumFollowRelLink` in the context of PowerShell cmdlets. Given the design choice to separate the enabling and filtering, I think the max value was the right decision. \r\n\r\nAs for warnings, they are generally frowned on as they are not useful (by default, anyway) in unattended scenarios. If someone was running the command fine with 999 pages, and suddenly there are 1000 or 10001 pages, and the automator is not watching for warnings, they may end up working with incomplete data without even knowing.\r\n\r\nThe Exchange cmdlets (such as `Get-Mailbox`) are notorious for causing problems because they return a limited number of results by default and a warning. This haunts many automation processes for O365 as orgs suddenly grow past the default threshold and automation is running on incomplete data sets.\r\n\r\nIntroducing a reduction in this default for `-MaximumFollowRelLink` now would be a [Bucket 1 breaking change](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-1-public-contract). So that's not something we can consider lightly and would require an RFC.\r\n\r\nA new feature could be added of some kind to address a scenario where an API might do this, but unless I'm convinced it's a common occurrence for API's to return a `next` link where there is no next page, I personally wouldn't want to spend time investigating, designing, and coding possible workarounds.",
