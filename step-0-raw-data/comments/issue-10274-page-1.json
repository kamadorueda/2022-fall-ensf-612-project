    "body": "@PaulHigin @KirkMunro \r\n\r\nI have looked at the code you mention ( that was my original approach) but to my suprise it does not work. At least with the current implementation. I have already posted some of this on #4287 and I would love to get your input. I re-post it here for convience:\r\n\r\n### Changing the working directory of the pwsh remote server:\r\n1. The command line argument `workingdirectory` does not work when the pwsh process runs in server mode (-s flag). See [consolehost.cs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/3ca5a1bdb031eeb9453b1481bcfa23eee6d89aec/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ConsoleHost.cs#L204). The function that initiates the process into server mode does not even take into consideration the working directory parameter provided by the user.\r\n\r\n2. Using `_startInfo.WorkingDirectory = ...` also did not work either. The surprising part here ( at least for me) was that even though the new process working directory was the one specified by the process `_startInfo` the initial location did not change. I used process explorer [source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) to verify that the process working directory was passed correctly.\r\n\r\n### Thoughts & Questions\r\n\r\n1. Since the InitializationScript parameter of the cmdlet is passed to the process startupInfo as part of the process arguments, I do not see how we could have a workingDirectory parameter for Start-Job that would be able to set the working directory also for the InitializationScript. Unless we enable the `workingDirectory` parameter in `serverMode`. Is this part of the requirement?\r\n\r\n2. Do you think that enabling the `workingDirectory` parameter when powershell runs in server mode is a good addition?\r\n\r\n3. Is there documentation (or some old issue that I could read to understand better) on the communication protocol between PowerShell and Powershell server mode? \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think :) ",
