Continuing is obviously an error since it would only return one property when you explicitly asked for two. (I assume you asked for two because you actually expected two properties). So it seems to me that `Select-Object` is exhibiting the correct behaviour.",

It should have been `Select-Object ab`, and it's now fixed. \r\n\r\nIn reply to @BrucePay (2nd reply): See \"Explanation\" for a real-world example. The \"Steps to reproduce\" consists of a minimal reproduction. If you don't use Outlook object model, I'll write down a more familiar scenario:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n# Let's say the REST method returns JSON, which gives the following properties:\r\n# FirstName, LastName, FullName,\r\n# Email1Address, Email2Address, Email3Adddress,\r\n# Email1DisplayName, Email2DisplayName, Email3DisplayName,\r\n# Birthday, Notes, SignificantOther, Company, Anniversary\r\n$result = Invoke-RestMethod <# parameters ignored #>;\r\n$result | Select-Object -Property *name*, *email* | Out-GridView;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat I would like to do is to inspect properties related to name and emails. Since `Email1DisplayName` matches both pattern, `Select-Object` tries to add it to the resulting object twice.\r\n\r\nIf you are talking about `select a, a` case, I would suggest the cmdlet not detect such case (ignore the error, too) because of logical simplicity and the possible scenario of merging two sets of properties to select. If we were to detect error (not taking list merging into consideration), we must keep track of each property, whether it is selected by the following possible combinations:\r\n\r\n- none;\r\n- non-wildcard once;\r\n- non-wildcard multiple times;\r\n- wildcard once;\r\n- wildcard multiple times;\r\n- non-wildcard once, wildcard multiple times;\r\n- non-wildcard multiple times, wildcard once;\r\n- non-wildcard multiple times, wildcard multiple times.\r\n\r\nAnd we must define which of these cases produce an error. It'll be cumbersome in the code and for people. Instead, I suggest we keep it simple by ignoring re-selection.\r\n\r\nP.S. What I meant by list merging is:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$mandatoryProps = @('a', 'b', 'c')\r\n$userProps = Get-PropertiesUserWantsToSee;\r\n$toSelect = $mandatoryProps + $userProps;\r\n$sourceObjects | Select-Object $toSelect | Out-GridView;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is possible to use `[System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[string]]` as a workaround, but you need to be careful -- construct the object with case-insensitive comparator or `.ToLowerInvariant()` when inserting the elements.\r\n\r\nIn reply to @mklement0 (3rd and 5th reply): Yes, your interpretation gets what I intended to convey.",
