You need to ship **one module** because the PowerShellGallery doesn't currently handle having multiple architecture-specific versions of assemblies.\n2. You need to load the right assembly at run time\n\n### Solution Ideas\n1. Fix it at **install time**: Fix the PowerShellGallery and the module to be able to publish multiple modules based on the PSEdition **and/or** PSVersion, and download the right version automatically, or the specified version on demand, or all versions.\n2. Fix it at **load time**: Decide on a convention (probably just use the same [convention](https://docs.nuget.org/create/enforced-package-conventions) that [NuGet uses](http://blog.nuget.org/20141014/in-the-platform.html) right?) and make `Add-Type -Assembly` and `RequiredAssemblies` _and also_ `RootModule` to load the right assembly automatically.\n",

I have the same issue as @richardszalay pointed out on how to publish the module to the psgallery so I would as well appreciate any suggestion.\n\nIf I can add to the conversation a secondary issue I experienced is that when I build the module (dll) in the dotnet core project, the nuget dependencies are not copied to the output folder. My understanding is that this is by dotnet core design, and there is no way around it. Dependencies are only copied to the output directory when publishing a command line executable. So, just for the sake of testing, I copied the dependencies manually. Some of the dependencies were actually not required (like all the System.\\* that are already loaded by the powershell assembly), so I also add to remove the redundant dependencies. This makes the task of packaging the resource quite painful.\nIt would be nice if somehow the dependencies could be installed directly from nuget when installing the package. Maybe adding the dependency list on the module manifest.\n",
