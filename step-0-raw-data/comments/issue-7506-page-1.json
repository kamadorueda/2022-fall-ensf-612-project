    "body": "I've been looking into this with @SeeminglyScience in terms of the possible methods of implementation, and we've found a couple possibilities -- but each seems to have their drawbacks.\r\n\r\n### First, in terms of implementing C#-style named method / constructor arguments:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Duplicate or inherit from `NamedAttributeArgumentAst`\r\nThis is somewhat problematic, as it would introduce a new AST class and thus break compatibility with PS Standard.\r\n\r\n#### 2. Re-use or re-name and repurpose `NamedAttributeArgumentAst` for more generic use cases\r\nAgain, kind of problematic for the above reason. I do think that this might end up being the most *tidy* method, however.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Special-case it in the parser\r\nThis would (probably) mean the tokenizer would need to *not* parse the name of the parameter as a generic/command token, and something like a `ReadOnlyCollection<Tuple<int, string>>` would need to be passed around with the `List<ExpressionAst>` for the regular method arguments.\r\n\r\nThis might have the least impact, but requires a fair bit of special casing and would be completely inconsistent with the nearest-comparable syntax PS has currently, i.e., named attribute arguments -- although these aren't really *method arguments* per se.\r\n\r\n### Second, regarding hashtable-casting syntax\r\n\r\nThis is also problematic. C# permits method signatures that differ simply by the *order* of the parameters. As a result, the hashtable construction would need to mimic `[PSCustomObject]`'s handling of retaining the order of parameters, and there are a good many edge cases that would require complex logic to implement.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it would almost certainly be impossible to set object properties as well, due to the fact that constructor argument names and actual object property names may collide or differ unexpectedly. If it *were* permitted to take constructor arguments it would have to be a solid either that _or_ setting properties as it does currently.\r\n\r\nSo, the latter is *probably* not the best idea to work with.\r\n\r\nI would appreciate any thoughts you guys have on this matter; I *think* these suggestions are all doable, to varying degrees of complexity, but I would appreciate your input on whether there is another possibility that I haven't come across as yet, and/or what the best approach may be here. 😄 ",

The parser would then treat that token as a unary operator, parsing it's child expression. This helpfully avoids touching the argument parsing code.\r\n\r\nI think what I've described above is straightforward.\r\n\r\nOnce you can parse - the fun begins. Updating the binders to support named arguments will require some pretty deep understanding of how dynamic binding works. I'm happy to mentor whoever takes this on - ping me on Gitter when you're ready.",
