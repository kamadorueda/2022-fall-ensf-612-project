    "body": "I've done some thinking on this, especially since it was a consideration around login profile support for PowerShell.\r\n\r\n(Our solution there is to run /bin/sh to execute the profile and then `exec` PowerShell from there.)\r\n\r\nPOSIX shells tend to call dot-sourcing just \"sourcing\" and the reason they do that is because there isn't a parent process involved, they just execute the source in the current scope. That means that more than just environment variables (which are defined with the `export` command and exported to *child* processes), sourced scripts also modify shell variables and function definitions in the calling scope. Clearly that's something PowerShell wouldn't be able to support.\r\n\r\nSo instead, as you suggest, we could slurp up the environment variables defined in the POSIX shell subprocess. [That's not a very natural thing, for a child process to communicate environment *upward* to a parent](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/372627/is-it-possible-to-pass-environment-variables-from-child-to-parent-in-user-space). We can't use output, since the shell script itself may output things and we won't reliably be able to sift intended output from our output. So we'd need a secure file or named pipe ACL'd to just these two processes, meaning complexity and a possible way to leak information. We'd need to dump the variables out in a way PowerShell could easily parse back in and set, so probably something like CSV or JSON.\r\n\r\nIn terms of invocation, the problem with automatic detection is:\r\n- Plenty of shell scripts don't have a reliable extension, or their intended interpreter isn't inferable from their extension\r\n- Shebangs are intended for invocation, not for parsing, and can contain arbitrary argument vectors ([since it's actually the OS that invokes it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)#Magic_number))\r\n\r\nSo I don't think automatic detection is a good idea. Instead, we should provide a more explicit mechanism for this. For example a cmdlet would be an easy and explicit way to specify a path to a script, an argument vector, and optionally parameterise the interpreter as well.\r\n\r\nWith all of this said, it's probably straightforward to write your own small version of a function like this in script. The components you'd need are:\r\n\r\n- PowerShell function with a parameter for the script path\r\n- A wrapper POSIX sh script that can invoke a given script with arguments and dump out the final env var settings to a file\r\n- A way to read that file in in PowerShell and then set the local environment accordingly",
