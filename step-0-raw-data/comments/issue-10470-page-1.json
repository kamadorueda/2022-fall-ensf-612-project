We defer to the Maintainers and Area Experts to review the technical and implementation aspects of the code. (And we expect that they'll mandate you include some tests in your PR as well :) )\r\n\r\nHaving looked over #10295, we'd prefer that you add your proposed commit to a separate PR. \r\n\r\nBut hey, thanks for the change. I always appreciate seeing improvements to syntax highlighting. ",
