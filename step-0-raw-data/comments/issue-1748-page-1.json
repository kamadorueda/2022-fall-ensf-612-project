    "body": "StorSimple team reported an issue over a year ago that they cannot create a process with `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` flag in a remote powershell session. It turns out the root cause is that when WinRM creates a powershell process for the remote session, it create a job without the 'JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK' limit and associate the powershell process with the job. Therefore, no child process can be created from a powershell remote session with the `CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB` flag.\r\n\r\nI know that `Start-Process -Wait` also creates a job and associate the child process with the job, so the same problem would happen to `Start-Process -Wait` too. However, I'm not aware of any scenario that is blocked by this issue.",

    "body": "I kind of remember this from WinRM days when we had reliability reports in this area...\r\nBasically, main point of a job is limiting resources (like memory) that can be used by a process/group of processes. So WinRM is restricting PS endpoints using jobs, so that remote PS endpoints would not exhaust machine's resources. (However, this also resulted that in heavy load situations, PS endpoints were getting errors because job's limits were reached)\r\nAnother good thing of a job is easy process lifetime management - regardless of how many child processes PS endpoint creates - WinRM can guarantee correct release of resources when endpoint is closed - when it closes the job - all job's processes will be closed.\r\n\r\nAs I see it - adding 'JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_BREAKAWAY_OK' flag will basically add a way to client PS code to avoid WinRM's resource and lifetime constraints for PS endpoints.",
