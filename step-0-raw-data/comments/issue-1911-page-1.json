As well as to allow deleting an old (may be buggy) driver before reinstalling.\r\n* Install - Installing a driver for e.g. an \"Unknown Device\", same as the \"select from list\" and \"select from file\" within device manager. Also to replace a currently installed driver with another one.\r\n* Set Properties - Update properties of drivers that have options in the driver's menu in the device manager (like Bluetooth, network, serial/parallel-port, ... drivers)\r\n* Handling of non-pnp drivers\r\n* Refresh - Scan for hardware change\r\n* Install non-pnp driver\r\n* Query data from the Events tab of a device driver\r\n* Power Management - Allow configuring the power management settings (e.g. \"Allow the computer to turn this device to save power\" on and off)\r\n* Set write-cache policies of disk drives\r\n",

    "body": "@PowerShell/wg-powershell-cmdlets reviewed this\r\n\r\nA comprehensive device management module would indeed be very useful for many users. The available module “PnPDevice” with its rather limited capabilities was added during the “Windows PowerShell” timeframe. It is no longer actively maintained. \r\nWith the advent of cross-platform “PowerShell”, the PowerShell team focuses on the core automation engine and general features that are platform-independent. Since device management is highly OS specific with no dependencies to the PowerShell engine, this would be a perfect example for the community to invest in a comprehensive modern device management module. \r\nFor the mentioned reasons, the PowerShell team is not able to evolve the PnPModule. Its status is “frozen”at the current feature level and exists primarily for backwards compatibility, similar to “Windows PowerShell”",
