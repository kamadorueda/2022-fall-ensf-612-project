    "body": "I updated the repro making it slightly simpler (cloning puppetlabs-powershell wasn't necessary, just needed to add `require 'timeout'` to the script and it runs just fine with just `ruby` installed.\n\nWhen I run the modified repro, it does hang when running the in-box `powershell.exe`, but exits correctly with my fix to #2090.\n\nThat said, the output is still missing. I verified that PowerShell is receiving the command and executing them, but the ruby script stopped reading from `stdout` before the commands ran. I increased the timeout and verified the output was received.\n\nSo I think this issue is the same as #2090, but it would be great if you can confirm.\n",
