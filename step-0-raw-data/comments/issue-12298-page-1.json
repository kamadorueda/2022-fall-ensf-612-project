So extension is not \"a chain of extensions\" in general.\r\nCommon convention is that extension is a part after last dot. .Net follows this and we follow .Net.\r\n\r\nUsers can easily get suffixes by split operator. Also users can use ETS to add suffixes property to Path type.\r\n\r\nI don’t think it’s worth adding to Engine.\r\n",
