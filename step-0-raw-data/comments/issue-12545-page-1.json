When attaching via Visual Studio, I can see that `Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces.dll` is already loaded twice, once by powershell base application (v5), and once by Az.Storage already (some odd v4 version). My cmdlet references the exact same Azure.Storage.Blob/Common/Queue versions as Az.Storage, but also references the v5 version of AsyncInterfaces which when I attempt to instantiate something from the Azure.Storage.Blob assembly inside my cmdlet, causes a TypeLoadException, seemingly because AsyncPageable type returned by Azure.Storage.Blob is implementing the v4 version of IAsyncEnumerable but my cmdlet is referencing the v5 version of it.\r\n\r\nAnyway thanks for the tip and I'll see if Az.Storage is being loaded by something else. Is it possible it is being loaded by some other Az.* module? Anyway to trace that?",
