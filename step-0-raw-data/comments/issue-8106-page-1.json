    "body": "So I've been working on the Validator Attribute. It seems to work okay in testing so far, but I haven't had a lot of time with it. I really like this as a solution as it *adds* functionality to PowerShell that users can apply to their scripts. Are you building a cmdlet and want a `-Scope` parameter, where validation is kind of important? This can definitely help with that. Just throw a `[ValidateScope()]` attribute on it and continue on. \r\n\r\nFor now, I use TabExpansionPlusPlus and this completer: \r\n\r\n``` powershell\r\n$ScopeCompleter = {\r\n    param ($commandName, $parameterName, $wordToComplete, $commandAst, $fakeBoundParameter)\r\n\r\n    \"Local\", \"Script\", \"Global\" | ForEach-Object { New-CompletionResult $_ }\r\n}\r\n$ScopeCompleterArgs = @{\r\n    CommandName = (Get-CommandWithParameter -ParameterName Scope)\r\n    ParameterName = \"Scope\"\r\n    ScriptBlock = $ScopeCompleter\r\n}\r\n\r\nRegister-ArgumentCompleter @ScopeCompleterArgs\r\n```\r\n\r\nValidated scope parameters, like on `Install-Module` do not get overwritten by this. \r\n\r\n_Update_\r\n\r\nI just realized the base TabExpansionPlusPlus _already_ includes the Scope parameter expansion (wicked smart, Jason). I never included Jason's original completers, which upon review, should be a 15 yard penalty. So just importing the full TabExpansionPlusPlus solves this problem, no need to include my completer. Use it though, if you don't want to add TabExpansionPlusPlus, just be sure to swap out the `New-CompletionResult` line with a proper `[System.Management.Automation.CompletionResult]` object. ",

    "body": "@romero126 \r\n\r\nThe numbered scopes isn't an issue for tab completion, and there is no easy way to determine _which_ of the number is a valid scope. I mean there is, if you dig through the call stack, but that just seems like a folly. So the tab completion comes down to **4** real choices, and as I mention above, Jason Shirk's [TabExpansionPlusPlus](https://github.com/lzybkr/TabExpansionPlusPlus) module adds completer for _every_ command that uses a `-Scope` parameter (see [here](https://github.com/lzybkr/TabExpansionPlusPlus/blob/master/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core.ArgumentCompleters.ps1) if you want to do it yourself for some reason). \r\n\r\nYour ValidateScript solution is _fine_ for a one-off script and for a _single user_. I'm talking about a _systematic_ ... issue? I still don't necessarily think it's an issue nor an oversight. At this point, I guess I'm talking about an additional feature. \r\n\r\nLike I mentioned above, A ValidateScope attribute just makes it easy for validating these scopes for anyone, PowerShell wide. \r\n\r\n[Here is a Gist](https://gist.github.com/endowdly/076ecad977e3270ea238f9da8f6201a1) of my ValidateScopeAttribute I've been toying with to see what I'm talking about.\r\n",
