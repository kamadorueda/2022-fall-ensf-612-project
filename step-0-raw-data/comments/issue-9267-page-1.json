Here's where it's handled:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/4005f50faaa5d7f37de431aeb9283ac4f144c088/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs#L7151-L7156\r\n\r\nPowerShell is creating a temporary variable to use byref so it can call `PSReference.set_Value` after the method invocation. That stops your example syntax from working as well, same result of `20`. A possible solution would be to use the same `ParameterExpression` for any arguments where `PSReference._value` is the same `PSVariable`.\r\n\r\nTbh I'm not really sure this is worth fixing, just wanted it documented somewhere (even if that's as an issue closed as `wontfix`)",
