User needs to explicitly set $DebugPreference/$VerbosePreference to \"Continue\" to leave message to the output and transcript. I have also verified it on powershell 2013 on windows 8.1pro (as attached) which has the same behavior.\r\n\r\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16246343/26632750/00311088-45c6-11e7-9e5f-a8145bbf2bae.PNG)\r\n",
