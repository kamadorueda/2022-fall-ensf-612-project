    "body": "> I'm unclear as to whether the 2.0.0 version is actually required or if that's just a minimum version. A quick test seems like it's just the latter but honestly I'm just starting to play around with it all so I don't fully understand the landscape.\r\n\r\nJust the minimum. SDK version doesn't matter as much anymore as *most* versions you'll see installed these days will work just fine (unless you're using newer C# language features, then you'll need a newer version).  The doc could use some updating for sure.\r\n\r\n> I'm also curious what happens when .NET 5.0 is released? How does that affect building binary modules that are meant to be compatible with pwsh 5 and newer?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really.  For example, I'm currently building netstandard2.0 libs with the `5.0.100-rc.2` version of the SDK without issue (for C# 9 features).\r\n",
