It just kills readability.\r\nModern IDEs with IntelliSense save us from typing long names. And modern best practice is to use self-descriptive names that can be long. So I'd consider the issue as \"by design and won't fix\". \r\nIt is worth noting that this design is very simple and straightforward. And it has a significant problem that we should really solve - _it cannot describe any complex set of parameters_. As a result, we are forced to use dynamic parameters or, more often, simply add logic to the code to say which parameters can be used together and which not (with lost tab completion).\r\nThere is another scenario that we cannot implement for this reason - tab completion for native commands.\r\nI suggest not to waste time on cosmetic aliasing but focus on creating a new design. (With new names, maybe short :-) )\r\n",

    "body": "> do you have concrete proposals for what such a new design would entail? Sounds interesting \r\n\r\nI do not know the solution and so far I only see difficulties with the current attributes.\r\n- Existing tools are very simple to create one-two level parameter sets. \r\n- Further complexity grows exponentially. We have to apply dynamic parameters, which can also be difficult and inconvenient. As well as perform special processing in the begin block.\r\n- It is also impossible (relatively speaking) to create a single set of parameters for several cmdlets like Path, LiteralPath, Encoding (that resembles interfaces).\r\n- This could work also for external commands so that we could implement tabcompletion for them.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this could be a single attribute (cmdlet/wrapper class) with definitions based on some notation and a parser. I guess it is not too difficult. The main difficulty will arise with the integration into the existing binding mechanism without regressions.",
