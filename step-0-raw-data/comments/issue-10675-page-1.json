    "body": "Resolving PSDrive-based paths to native filesystem paths on all platforms sounds like a nice enhancement.\r\n\r\nYes, on Unix quoting is already being used to distinguish between a (potential) filesystem path to be `~`-resolved _and globbed_ (unquoted) and a literal argument (quoted), a nod to POSIX-like shells.\r\n\r\nHowever, the automatic globbing is probably not a good idea on Windows, where it is up to the target command to expand globs (wildcard expressions).\r\n\r\nSo that gives us the following - is that what you had in mind?\r\n\r\n* All platforms:\r\n  * Expand _unquoted_ (token-initial) `~` (as before, only if followed by an unquoted path separator or nothing at all)\r\n       * As an aside: Currently, this feature isn't fully compatible with the POSIX-like shell feature it emulates: see   #11386\r\n\r\n  * Convert an _unquoted_ path that starts with a PS-only drive spec to a native filesystem path (if it's a _filesystem_ PS drive).\r\n\r\n* Unix-like platforms only:\r\n\r\n  * Perform globbing (expansion to individual filename arguments based on wildcard patterns) on _unquoted_ paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
