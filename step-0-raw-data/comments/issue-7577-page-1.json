    "body": "@lzybkr Just a bump that this is still an issue, tested all the way up to Windows Insider and latest pwsh preview. Workaround is to not use write-host at all in your prompt (which is where the slowness was most visible) but to use ANSI escape sequences only, which is more viable now with Windows 1809 than it was in the past.\r\n\r\nI have observed that it **does not** occur when running -version 2 parameter, I currently can't verify 3/4/5 to see if there's a point it was introduced, but it may be due to the new Write-Information and Write-Host layer that was added in 5\r\n",
