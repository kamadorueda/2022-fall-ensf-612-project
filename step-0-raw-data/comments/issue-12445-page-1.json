    "body": "Sooner or later. Well I think I started with PowerShell in 2006. I worked for Microsoft at the time, and met Jeffrey Snover at Tech-ed before I had any idea who he was. In 14 years - 4 of them still at Microsoft evangelizing PowerShell, through setting up some of the first user groups speaking  at more conferences than I can count. This is the first time someone has expressed any desire for this function. Now OK, I've spent those years talking people who get that it is both OK and expected to join Get-X  to Export-Csv, because there's no built in command for that. \r\n \r\nJust as an aside my prompt has looked something like this for at least 8 or 9 years\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/80283339-aa9e1480-870e-11ea-8056-0bebad673f48.png)\r\nThe number is the history number so I can do \\[\\#\\]540[tab] to get a line back, and long before it was in PSreadline it had persistent history so my history starts at 500. \r\n\r\nI have this in my profile which I blogged about in 2012\r\n```powershell \r\nImport-Csv -Path $logfile | Select-Object -last $truncateLogLines  | tee-object -variable history | Add-History -ErrorAction silentlyContinue\r\n$history | Export-Csv -path $logfile -encoding unicode -NoTypeInformation\r\nRemove-Item -Path variable:\\History\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd my prompt has this \r\n```Powershell\r\n$hid       = $myinvocation.HistoryId\r\nif    ($hid -gt 1 -and -not $debugging) {Get-History -Id ($hid -1 ) | ConvertTo-Csv | Select-Object -last 1 | Add-Content -Encoding ascii -Path $logfile}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo I have probably called Get-History | convertTo-CSV more times than anyone else alive!\r\nI must have called Add-history tens of thousands of times. So if someone says exporting history needs a special command. No, it does not. \r\n\r\nThey only way to add items to the History is with the Add command. And the only way to delete from the history is with the clear command. (Again if one is a purist removing one item by ID should really be remove-history)\r\nOut of four basic operations Create, read, update, Delete, we have 3 and update doesn't make sense, and then we have invoke you can't do `Get-History | invoke-Command `   (A purist would say Invoke-command is broken and needs fixing). And if you know the ID  \\[\\#\\] ID [tab] [enter] is two fewer keystrokes than [i][h][y][space]id[enter].  The only thing you'd want Invoke to do is run multiple items... \r\nIf you want to find something in the history there isn't a Select-History because you use get-history | where. And so on. \r\nSimilarly we don't have export-service , though often on a server we want a file with a list of services. Do we think the service family is missing a member it has get- new- remove- restart- set- start- stop- suspend- , why no export ? Because it doesn't need it. \r\nLocal user has enable- disable- get- net- remove- rename- set- but - oh, the horror - no export ? Seeing a pattern ? \r\nYou raised aliases , which might go back a  long way to people wanting to share aliases in PS V1 - but there is no Export-PSDrives, or export-Variables ? \r\nAnd if you do have an export-Thing command it's always going to be the wrong format. I do a lot of work on the export- part of the importExcel module. OK not everyone wants their stuff in .XLSx . But people want it in .CSV, XML, HTML, JSON and YAML.  Hence Get | Convertto-Format  or Get | export-Format. \r\n\r\nLike I say, fundamental stuff.  I like to quote this from Snover, and he was talking about what was wrong with piping in unix\r\n_You pipe A to B to C … because A doesn't do what you want it to do. [Why …?] Because A tightly couples three separate steps into one. A gets a set of objects, it processes those objects, it outputs the objects as text. So, when you say A doesn't do what you want it to do what you're really saying is “I didn't get the right objects”, “I didn't process them the way I wanted to” or “I didn't output them to text the way I wanted to”. So, then piping it to B and C is really the process of trying to take the text and reverse engineer your way back to the beginning of the pipeline to do one of the steps differently. And the heart of PowerShell was [to keep the pipeline model] and output text only when you need to._\r\n\r\nThe founding philosophy is not to do the tight coupling you're asking for. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",
