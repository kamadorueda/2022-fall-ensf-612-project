    "body": "@scriptingstudio \r\n> @jhoneill just a couple of doc examples \r\n\r\nYes I'd found Boe Prox's one which basically says \"this is not for scalars\", and Kirk's one says \", two new “magic” methods were introduced for collection types\"   So not scalars either. These are community experts explaining it, not information from the authors.\r\n> > I _thought_ `.foreach()` and `.where()` were for arrays only.\r\n> \r\n> Yes, but Count works for scalar and foreach()/where() too.\r\n\r\nYes, @iSazonov I've relied on that for years...  I use `.where()`  heavily and I'm now thinking  \"Do I only use it on what I know will be an array, or do I trust it to do the right thing with a scalar.\"  \r\n\r\nThe syntax Mike's using is in about_arrays (not About_foreach) and there is a note in about_Intrinsic_Members\r\n\r\nThere are  certainly some things that are not right ... \r\n```\r\nps > $s = \"one two three\"\r\nps > $s.where({$_.length -gt 10 } )\r\none two three\r\n\r\nps > $s.where({$_.length -gt 10 } ) += \"four\"\r\nInvalidArgument: Cannot convert value \"one two three\" to type \"System.Management.Automation.WhereOperatorSelectionMode\".  Error: \"Unable to match the identifier name one two three to a valid enumerator name. Specify one of the following enumerator names and try again:\r\nDefault, First, Last, SkipUntil, Until, Split\"\r\n\r\nps > > $s.where({$_.length -gt 10 } ) + \"four\"\r\none two three\r\nfour\r\n ```\r\nThe second has turned the scalar into an array. But the first one seems have turned the whole thing inside out. \r\n",
