The cmdlet is not actually throwing a terminating error, it just looks like it is. What actually happens is that when an error is encountered, the error is written and the cmdlet stops processing the specific directory it is currently processing.\r\n\r\nConsider the following directory tree:\r\n```\r\n tmp\r\n |-- alpha\r\n |   |-- file1\r\n |   |-- file2\r\n |   `-- file3\r\n |-- beta\r\n |   |-- file4\r\n |   `-- file5\r\n `-- gamma\r\n     `-- file6\r\n```\r\nwhere our current directory is `tmp.` When a \"flat\" `Get-ChildItem` is run and during processing the directory `beta` is renamed or deleted, the error is written and the cmdlet stops processing the `tmp` directory and it looks like a terminating error.\r\n\r\nIf instead we ran a deeper `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`, and while processing the `alpha` directory one of the files within that directory were renamed or deleted, an error would be written and the cmdlet would stop processing the `alpha` directory then return up to continue processing the `tmp` directory which would continue processing the `beta` and `gamma` directories.\r\n\r\nI've made a couple of changes that allow processing of a directory to continue if a condition like this occurs. I'm working now on what happens when while processing a directory, that directory itself is deleted.",

Now when I enumerate a directory on Ubuntu with inaccessible sub directories I get expected behavior ... a full enumeration with error on directories that couldn't be accessed.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this was fixed at some point.  But I wonder if this was just a case where an unexpected exception is thrown and not handled.  Do we catch specific exceptions during enumeration?  If so then that might account for the directory enumeration terminating abruptly under certain error conditions.\r\n\r\nRegarding enumerating directories that have changed.  It seems to me that this behavior is correct, to abandon that directory since it is in an inconsistent state.",

    "body": "@PaulHigin The function that walks directories does handle specific exceptions: `ArgumentException`, `IOException` and `UnauthorizedAccessException`. I'm going to be adding additional try/catch handlers for more specific IO exception types a little deeper in scope within the function.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking what we would want is if a single file or sub-directory within a directory triggers an error we should not abandon that directory, just write an error and move on to the next entry. If, however, the \"current\" directory *itself* goes away mid-process then we abandon that directory and go back up to the parent if present. Does that make sense?\r\n",
