    "body": "> It does not matter what you call it. It is still dramatic overkill.\r\n\r\nI would strongly disagree. Consider the purpose of an IDE - it is to help folks write, test, and release great code and the artifacts associated (eg readme.MD files, etc). The Windows PowerShell ISE was a great product for its day and was a tool I loved and used extensively.  But then along came VS Code. For me, the early versions were sub-optimal. As a _user_ of an IDE, having to hand-edit JSON to change fonts was a bit too much of an ask. But then, month by month it improved. And today, it is a great product and one I recommend for both users of Windows PowerShell and PowerShell 7. The various add-ins are all excellent and help me to write code.  I personally think that recommending VS Code is the right approach. The ISE is feature complete and is not going to be improved. \r\n\r\nI am curious., as someone who has used PowerShell for nearly 20 years, why you feel VS Code is overkill?",

It **works well** right out of the box.  It handles characters set used very well. Tab handling is excellent. I can write the code wih syntax help and then run with F5. And possibly save. It is ideal for the job.\r\n\r\nI'm thoroughly unimpressed with Visual Studio Code. I don't like editors which I have to program before they work sensibly. It does not handle characte sets or tabs in a sensible manner out of the box. It is a shitty product for my needs.\r\n\r\nI can live fine with 5.1 syntax checking in the IDE for the time being.",
