    "body": "There is no intentional correlation in ordering of parameters during tab completion and the position attribute.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the order is the order declared, but this is not guaranteed. For binary cmdlets, we rely on reflection, and the order returned by reflection is not guaranteed. It is often the order the parameters were defined in C#, but not necessarily.\r\n\r\nAlso note that hosts are free to reorder the completions, e.g. Intellisense may sort them alphabetically.\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear if honoring the position provides a good experience with all cmdlets - e.g. if we started mixing parameter sets to honor position, things could get more confusing.",
