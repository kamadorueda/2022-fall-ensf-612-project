    "body": "Some history/context:\r\n\r\n@mklement0  wrote:\r\n>  I'm not even sure if statement-terminating errors were ever meant to be\r\n\r\nThey are absolutely by design. Statement terminating exceptions are intended to mimic shell semantics. An error in a pipeline (optionally) writes a message then terminates the pipeline and sets `$?`. \r\n\r\nNow PowerShell error objects are much richer than traditional shell errors so one of the scenarios we had in mind was error recovery/remediation based on the contents of the error records. For example, if you're deleting a lot of files and there are some failures, the error records record which files were not deleted and why. This allows you to take additional actions in the script to delete those files. \r\n\r\nError disposition is also much richer in PowerShell through `-ErrorAction` and `$ErrorActionPreference`.  Unfortunately rich semantics also imply additional complexity. The more choices you can make implies more things to think about.\r\n\r\nPowerShell 1.0 also had `trap` (taken collectively from the Posix shell, Perl 6 and VB.) Trap has the interesting characteristic that it allows you to resume execution after an exception at the next statement in the current lexical context. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately `trap` was difficult to use when dealing with typical \"programmer\" scenarios so in PowerShell V2 we introduced `try/catch` . Now you have even more choices. This becomes especially tricky when you start to (inevitably) blend the various semantics.\r\n\r\nAnd one more dimension of complexity - expressions vs commands. For performance reasons, an expression is not evaluated in the context of the pipeline processor so it has slightly different error semantics.\r\n\r\nPhilosophically, our goal was such that if you wrote shell-style code, then you would get (enhanced) shell semantics and if you wrote programmer-style code (implied by the use of `try/catch`) then you would get (mostly) programmer semantics.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't mean that there aren't bugs (there are) or that we got the design totally right. However, tweaking the existing semantics without a total scenario review is unlikely to make things better, just different implying new confusion not less confusion. I do think it would be interesting to do the full scenario review and see if a new \"error mode\" makes sense. (Note: if we did an error mode it would have to be a compile-time switch i.e. `#requires` rather than yet another runtime preference variable.) \r\n\r\n> I've been calling \"script-terminating\" error for simplicity\r\n\r\nYes - this is the preferred terminology. 'Runspace terminating' is inaccurate as the error doesn't \"terminate\" the runspace, just the currently executing set of statements i.e. the script.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@BrucePay, there are multiple problematic aspects with PowerShell's current error handling, so why not take this opportunity to perform the full scenario review you propose:\r\n\r\n* The lack of proper documentation and official terminology, which https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/1583 addresses, but it's obviously no substitute for official documentation.\r\n\r\n* The lack of integration of native-executable calls into PowerShell's error handling.\r\n\r\n* The complexity stemming from multiple constructs, as you've discussed.\r\n\r\n* The surprising asymmetries around the _two types_ of _terminating_ errors that exist, which is what prompted creation of this issue:\r\n\r\n  * `-ErrorAction` only affects _non_-terminating errors, while `$ErrorActionPreference` also affects _statement_-terminating errors (promotes them to _script_-terminating ones).\r\n  * A binary cmdlet can _only_ throw a _statement_-terminating error.\r\n  * PowerShell code can _only_ throw a _script_-terminating error, with `throw` (unless you go out of your way - available in an advanced script/functions only - to call `$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError()`, which is both obscure and cumbersome).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs you state, a change in this area would inevitably be breaking and require an _opt-in_; a concern regarding a `#require` directive would again be to ensure _lexical_ scoping rater than the usual dynamic one that affects all descendant scopes - the same issue that just came up in the context of https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14747#issuecomment-784578379.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Statement terminating exceptions are intended to mimic shell semantics. \r\n\r\nIt is the _non_-terminating errors that mimic shell semantics, while offering additional features (log of errors in `$Error`, per-command error collection with `-ErrorVariable`).\r\n\r\n`cmd.exe` offers no terminating errors at all, whereas POSIX-compatible shells offer the equivalent of `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`, i.e. _script_-terminating errors via `set -e` (which is [often eschewed](http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashFAQ/105) in favor or per-call error handling with `|| exit`; we now offer something similar, but with more cumbersome syntax (`|| $(exit $LASTEXITCODE)` or, if `throw` is sufficient, `|| $(throw)`).\r\n\r\nThese shells themselves have no concept of _statement_-terminating errors (although individual executables can choose to abort pipeline processing by closing their end of the pipe prematurely).\r\n\r\nPowerShell's _statement_-terminating errors offer a way to abort a pipeline _instantly, as a whole_, in case an error condition so severe is encountered that _further pipeline processing makes no sense_. Statement-terminating errors also occur in expressions, such as when .NET methods throw an exception.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether it is helpful to _by default_ terminate _only_ the pipeline / statement being executed.\r\n\r\nTo me, it isn't: given that it indicates an error condition that is _severe_, the more sensible behavior is to terminate the _script_.\r\n\r\nThat is, we can make do without the concept of a _statement_-terminating error and only have _one_ type of terminating error: the _script_-terminating error:\r\n\r\n* This amounts to a substantial conceptual simplification that automatically makes the above-mentioned asymmetries go away.\r\n* Those who want a script-terminating error to be _in effect_ only statement(-block)-terminating can and should use `try` / `catch` (or `trap`, but my sense is that it is rarely used anymore).\r\n\r\nI believe that this, along with integrating external-executable calls (treat nonzero exit codes as _non_-terminating errors, but escalate to script-terminating with `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`, with the selective exceptions discussed in the [Native Command Error Handling RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/717787c26ff50d5e9130c34aadc5c4d5b9c86b64/1-Draft/RFC00XX-Native-Command-Error-Handling.md)), would go a long way toward solving the current problems.\r\n\r\n",

It would be confusing to use in documentation, but a pipeline is sort of the rawest measurement of a unit of execution in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nFor example, this code:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nPowerShell.Create().AddCommand(\"Get-ChildItem\").Invoke()\r\n\r\n// or more similar to what ConsoleHost does:\r\nusing var pipeline = runspace.CreatePipeline();\r\npipeline.Commands.Add(new Command(\"Get-ChildItem\", isScript: false));\r\npipeline.Invoke();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's no script there, it's just a pipeline processor that looks up the command info and creates a command processor.\r\n\r\nNone of this is to say that \"script-terminating\" isn't the right term to use for docs, I honestly don't know.  Just giving you the full picture.\r\n\r\n> Are you referring to the fact that in an _interactive_ session the underlying exception is _caught_, which thereby prevents termination?\r\n\r\nI would say that is generally a good way to look at it, and probably a good way to present it when not talking about implementation specifics.\r\n\r\nIf we were being the absolute strictest of nitpicky, the thread is only terminated when one of these happens:\r\n\r\n1. The `Runspace` is set to `PSThreadOptions.ReuseThread` and is GCed\r\n2. The `Runspace` is set to `PSThreadOptions.UseNewThread` and the current top level pipeline is completed (successfully or otherwise)\r\n3. The `Runspace` is set to `PSThreadOptions.UseCurrentThread` and an exception is not caught by the caller\r\n\r\n`ReuseThread` is what most hosts (including `ConsoleHost`) use.  Since execution is actually handled on a different thread controlled by the `Runspace` object, the actual thread itself won't really terminate.\r\n\r\n(P.S.
