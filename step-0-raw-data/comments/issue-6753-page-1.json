I coded the actual implementation based on that pretty much as ...\r\n\r\n - A way to give people a preview - a comparison base of what it might look like. Being able to touch the actual design, rather than having a dusty document is just more real for many people.\r\n - A way to figure out how this whole process works (given the complexity I was sure I would be getting it wrong the first time around, no matter what)\r\n\r\nSo yes, even if the initial reception was rather positive in general, I went ahead with the full knowledge that I might be wasting my time if the proposal got reject or large revisions - like those proposed by you - were decided upon.\r\n\r\nI'll be filing that RFC as soon as I can make the time to fully read that documentation and process and write it all up - might take a day or two alas :(\r\n\r\nIf you have any guidance to offer regarding the documentation question as well - whether for this or for future issues - that would be much appreciated.",

As far as the RFC goes, I imagine it should be pretty simple - fill in the section on  motivation and the specification part is the code, tests and the documentation - essentially this PR.  (note: If there was much code or if it was complex, I would expect a more detailed specification but it's not. The parameter specifications are longer than the method bodies) But the rest of the committee members will have to agree with that. ",
