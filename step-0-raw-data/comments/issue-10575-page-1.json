    "body": "> Could we remove references to *types.ps1xml entirely and just rely on the .cs files?\r\n\r\nNow types.ps1xml is only a key to reference predefined types (also there is still GetEvent.types.ps1xml) which we load in each runspace at first step. It is not perf critical and I believe we could refactor the code. At least the code could become more readable.\r\nMain problem is that we clone TypeTable per runspace creation and do this complex and relatively slow. I have still no ideas how improve this. Obvious idea is exclude cloning type table with predefined types and reuse it. I am not sure that it is simple to implement.",
