    "body": "[MarkdownEx](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MarkdownEx/0.0.6) was a project created just 9 hours ago and published today so we couldn't have known about it.\r\n\r\nI don't believe these cmdlets preclude use of other third party Markdown cmdlets.\r\n\r\nThe [Markdown Rendering RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/b276b9a6f29f52b52209feccb4e4b108779ad690/3-Experimental/RFC0025-Native-Markdown-Rendering.md) was first published last April so certainly sufficient time to get feedback.\r\n\r\nThe current cmdlets are on a path for [native markdown support for help content](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3954) and move away from MAML which requires the doc writers to convert from markdown to publish.  Additional work in 6.2 timeframe to have this work end-to-end.\r\n\r\nThe longer term plan is to [decouple all modules from PS Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1979).",
