I would use `Get` or `Import` (depending on the purpose) verb for anything you're considering using 'Download' for.\r\n2. I'm not really sure why sorting the JSON is important as typically the order of properties is not important. If it is, you could use a Get or perhaps ConvertTo verb there. That's a fairly uncommon edge case in my opinion. Typically Sort-Object is more than sufficient.",

    "body": "Well, I took Sort and Download as an example but the restriction that we feel is not limited to these two. So limiting the discussion to these two would be missing the point that users like to have the freedom to name their functions as they find most apt. \r\n\r\nIf the goal is to make discovering commands easier, maybe PowerShell team can come up with a smarter way to deal with this where users can have their freedom and PowerShell could still discover the commands?  I don't know you are the smart guys in this area. I am someone who is just a user and loves using it. \r\n\r\nP.S: To answer your points, sorting JSON becomes important if I have to create an automation suite where I have to validate an asynchronously created JSON output with an existing snapshot. If I don't sort them on a key, I will be validating apples with oranges. And although I am using Get/Import for Download but every time I do that neither I nor my partner is happy about it since we are wrapping our obvious intent under something more generic as get/set etc.   ",

    "body": "`New-Object` does not apply to `Object`, in spite of its name.\r\n`Select-Object` applies to objects but it does not select them, another misnomer. `Select-SubObject` would be a better name.\r\n(Aside: `Select-String` does not apply to strings, at least not in the default parameter set.)\r\n`Compare/Measure-Object` do not apply to objects, they apply to collections.  `Measure` is a particularly bad name for this action, it should be `Summarise`; `Measure` itself should be free to use.\r\nI agree that `Group` could be reserved together with `Sort`, since they are different aspects of the same concept.  However, `Group` can also mean `Partition`—and partitions may be fuzzy while sorting cannot.  You cannot make fuzzy groups of objects but you can make fuzzy classes of seeds.  It is a different action expressed with the same verb.  If we reserved `Group` and introduced `Classify` or `Partition`, it would resolve the ambig&uuml;ity.\r\nThere is, however, one use case for a specific `Sort`: when the data you need to sort do not fit into available memory, you need to sort them in place.  But then you probably would not use PowerShell to do it anyway 😁",
