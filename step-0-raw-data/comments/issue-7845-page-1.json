I am not aware of any real benefit of exposing the wrapping ExtendedTypeDefinition here, please let me know if I am overlooking something in that respect.\r\nThe Dynamic param set would be to enable simple addition of (or changes to) a view for a type. Only allow supplying a list of properties to display for any given viewtype. We create a FormatViewDefinition from those internally. I am not sure how we can set the order of those yet (if listview comes before tableview in a FormatViewDefinition, that view is the default view). Maybe we add a parameter -DefaultView [Table|List|Wide]?\r\n\r\nI have done a little POC with just the Type param set, but I am still a bit unsure which parts of the Path implementation need to stay and which parts can be left out. \r\nThe db holding the views is buried like four layers deep, making it a bit complicated to unravel. \r\n\r\nI would like to hear feadback on the basic view I layed out above, and am also open to suggestions and any insights in the intricacies of the db.",
