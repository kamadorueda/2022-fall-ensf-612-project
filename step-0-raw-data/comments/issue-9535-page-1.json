    "body": "@fMichaleczek Looking at Peachpie, it converts PHP to .NET IL.  My thinking is that we want to support other languages in their native environment and not require them to be compiled into .NET.  So there would be PowerShell bindings for various languages we'd want to support.  PHP isn't one that came to mind, but Python would probably be something we'd want to support.  So rather than trying to implement PSCmdlet as it is defined today, you would have something equivalent in whatever language you want to use.  We haven't looked at this in detail yet due to other priorities.",
