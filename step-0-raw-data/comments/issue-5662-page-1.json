Such a large amount of code was changed, I have to take your word that no logic was changed.  Can we break this up into smaller PRs to get this done?   The following are ideas on how to break it up:\r\n    - Perhaps merge the partial classes without sorting ( should be easy to review )\r\n    - Sort using statements (should be easy to review)\r\n    - Sort various element attempting to keep under a line limit (I would complete at least one file.)  The link [@iSazonov](https://smartbear.com/learn/code-review/best-practices-for-peer-code-review/) suggested says 400.\r\n    - Sometimes between coworkers, we use commits for breaking up reviews\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@TravisEz13 I actually haven't enabled stylecop. I tried but couldn't get it to work. I believe it would apply to the entire utility assembly which would make it very hard to track down just the web cmdlet code issues. This was all somewhat beyond me. So I resorted to sorting the code manually and using the stylecop rules as guidance. We can't use them all as, for example, our contributor guidelines say to group the private backing fields with public properties. that will make it hard to see what private field  and private-before-public sorting issues are actually issues.\r\n\r\nI can break it up, yes. I tried breaking up a large change into the multiple commits in a single PR before, but @iSazonov didn't like that. I don't care how the work is broken up, but I could use some guidance, clarity, and consistency. I can be told one thing in a PR/issue, follow that to the letter in a new PR, and then have reviewers telling me to redo it a different way. This pattern has repeated several times and results in a lot of wasted time for all involved.\r\n\r\nSo, should I break this out into separate PRs? Or should I do multiple commits in a single PR or should I group a few commits in a few PRs? Should I move the files first? start with the partial class merges? ",
