Enable-PSRemoting will either turn on and configure remoting or it will reset remoting back to its original state.\r\n\r\nYou could tweak the behavior of Install-PowerShellRemoting to support -Force if an endpoint already exists. It would technically be a breaking change, but that could be valuable as it would protect against accidental overwrite.\r\n\r\nSide Note:\r\nI originally wrote Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 because I/we had not yet ported Enable-PSRemoting & friends. The only reason we kept it around afterward was the \"Nano Server Scenario.\" We needed a way to register an endpoint for a different instance of PowerShell (not the version that was running). There is a separate issue ( #4528 ) to formalize that scenario into a real cmdlet, but it hasn't been implemented yet.",

I added call to Set-StrictMode Latest in both scripts: Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 and also CustomShellCommands where Enable-PSRemoting is defined as PowerShell script.\r\n2. In both scripts (the same as above) I added \"-ErrorAction Stop\" for command for which it seemed reasonable. \r\n3. It seems currently there is a check in Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 script for Administrator rights:\r\n`if (! ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal] [Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole] \"Administrator\"))\r\n{\r\n    Write-Error \"WinRM registration requires Administrator rights. To run this cmdlet, start PowerShell with the `\"Run as administrator`\" option.\"\r\n    return\r\n}`\r\n4. I added the ScriptAnalyzer against the scripts and addressed the issues that it indicated. I left Write-Host in Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 though and I am wondering if we should get rid of it as it informs user about steps performed.",
