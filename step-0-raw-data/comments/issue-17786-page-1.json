This allows you to adapt scripts to run in places like a session 0 service, where a user has no way to interact with it--if you make a mistake, and your script calls `Read-Host`, things won't hang--it will fail instead, which is the desired behavior here.",

Within that environment, you can debug a script, which will call `EnterNestedPrompt` to setup the debugging prompt (see the screenshot below).\r\n\r\nAs for why `pwsh -noninteractive` gives back an interactive shell, @JamesWTruher believes it was for debugging scripts that are supposed to run in `noninteractive` mode.\r\n\r\nThe [help content](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_powershell_exe?view=powershell-5.1#-noninteractive) for the `-NonInteractive` flag says: _Does not present an interactive prompt to the user._ It's not very accurate and should be updated.
