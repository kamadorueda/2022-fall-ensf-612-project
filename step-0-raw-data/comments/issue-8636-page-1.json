Byte order is meaningless in UTF-8, and [isn't even recommended](http://www.unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#bom5). In fact, if the OP was correct that _streams_ were getting a BOM, this would probably be an egregious error. For instance if `echo` (aka `Write-Output`) was adding a BOM, that would be very bad.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm pretty sure that's not the case.  Additionally PowerShell has been using utf-8 without a preamble (aka BOM) as the default `$OutputEncoding` since [the 6.0 release candidate](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v6.0.0-rc) [PR #5369](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/5369), so my guess is that @mcandre is dealing with Windows PowerShell 5.x or older.",

A lot of programs work just fine using heuristics to correctly identify unicode characters in UTF-8 strings, and UTF-8 is for the most part backwards-compatible with ANSI.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a lot of Windows programs mistakenly insert a BOM into UTF-8 text, Notepad included, and other Windows programs such as Command Prompt will actually fail to correctly parse UTF-8 strings because they'd try to parse a BOM as if it were normal text, thus breaking a command.\r\n\r\nPrograms that _rely_ on using a BOM as a \"magic number\" to identify UTF-8 text, to put it simply, are doing it wrong. It is a good thing to develop a program that can correctly identify a BOM inside of a UTF-8 string (and correctly identify a unicode string by the presence of a BOM), but for the most part, it is simply bad practice to rely on that alone, as opposed to going the extra mile and actually using heuristics to reliably detect UTF-8 encoding _with or without_ the presence of a BOM.\r\n\r\nP.S.: Please don't reference controversial political figures in here. Also, nobody here is saying that other languages shouldn't exist, so please don't go comparing removal of the UTF-8 BOM to \"English first\". That's bordering on hate speech.\r\nP.P.S.: The English army is from England, the term you'd be looking for is American army.",
