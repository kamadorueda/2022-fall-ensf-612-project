    "body": "Wouldn't a more appropriate expected behavior for this be a single entry in `$error` consisting of the `ErrorRecord` that identifies the error, with the `Exception` property referencing an `ActionPreferenceStopException` that has an `InnerException` of `ParameterBindingException`?\r\n\r\ni.e. Why are we generating two entries in `$error` for what an end user perceives as a single error?\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when you have a `ParseException`, why are we adding an exception of type `ParseException` that contains an `ErrorRecord` with an `Exception` property of type `ParentContainsErrorRecordException` to `$error`? Why don't we simply add an `ErrorRecord` that contains an exception of type `ParseException` instead?\r\n\r\nIn either case, these changes could possibly be breaking for anyone who had built tooling that processes `$error` or that performs error handling, so does it matter? I'm not asking that because I feel these changes should not be made -- the fact that raw exceptions are added to `$error` and they way they are added makes it more difficult to process errors since the contents of the collection are inconsistent -- but I do wonder if it's worth my time to go through and try to correct such issues (which I would do, because I'm spending a lot of time with the PowerShell parser and debugger right now). I suppose an RFC is in order to discuss the collection of issues and propose a fix that would be beneficial enough to implement.",
