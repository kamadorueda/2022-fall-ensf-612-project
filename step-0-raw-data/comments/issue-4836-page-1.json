Ultimately, this is the job of the package manager, but I get why we might need something like [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, at this point in the release cycle, it's a pretty high-risk change to bring in (and potentially get wrong), especially when you consider that there won't be any production scenarios for side-by-side 6.x's for at least a little while. \r\n\r\nWhen we do want to bring it in, we should have an RFC for it (and I think we should have some alternate designs that include a PS module that enumerates versions as well as whether it should be a native tool to support bootstrap scenarios).\r\n\r\n@iSazonov do you have a scenario today where this is critical? I think unpacking that is the first step to understanding the proper implementation here (and where having a `pwsh` alias for PS Core isn't enough). ",
