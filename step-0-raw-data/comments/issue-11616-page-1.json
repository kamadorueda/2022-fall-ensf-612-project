    "body": "There are many reason why WinRM should **always** default to \"microsoft.powershell\" regardless of the version of the PowerShell client:\r\n\r\n- This endpoint is installed and **enabled by default** on Windows Server -- including in Azure.\r\n- The default endpoint should always be the **unversioned** endpoint. Otherwise _you'd have to know what was available on each each remote_!\r\n- The version of PowerShell a client is running should not affect which endpoint you connect to,\r\n\r\nYou know, the other problem is that there's no other endpoint you **can** connect to:\r\n\r\n- New versions of PowerShell do not register endpoints by default. There's no point defaulting to connect to an endpoint that _won't exist by default_.\r\n- Organizations that do _switch_ to new versions of PowerShell are required to install it during initialization, and must configure the endpoints themselves, so they can configure whatever endpoints they want to use by default.\r\n\r\nFrankly, at this point, that doesn't seem _that_ likely, based on the conversations I've had. It's more likely that devs and admins are installing new client versions on their personal development and administration machines, but to do their jobs, they still connect to whatever comes pre-configured on their servers.\r\n\r\nBecause of that, I think that if we are ready to say a new version of PowerShell **should be the default**, we should update the default endpoint to point to it. Register the versioned endpoints for use by software that requires a particular version (and add a `PowerShell.5`) but update the default to point at the latest version of PowerShell, and turn on remoting by default (on servers). Or rather, check the remoting box it by default if remoting is already enabled on the OS, and add another checkbox (also checked) to take over the default endpoint.\r\n\r\n",

When remoting using unnamed endpoints, if the version of PowerShell we are remoting into is Less than the current version, we should get a warning \"entering downlevel/older version of Powershell - V X.X\".

    "body": "I disagree with @PaulHigin and @Essentialexch on this. \r\n\r\nThe behaviour of PowerShell 7 is not consistent with how Windows PowerShell works.  IIRC, in each version (well since V2) of PowerShell, if you Enter-PSSession to localhost, you'd get an endpoint consistent with the current version of PowerShell.  In Windows PowerShell 5.1, if I enter a session it is a session with the same version. I don't suddenly and without warning get a different version.  With PowerShell 7. by default I get a downlevel version.  Why add inconsistency when consistency CAN be maintained easily.\r\n\r\nAnd as to @Essentialexch's comment. I slightly disagree with both points. Anyone who is going to move to PowerShell 7, has to know that there are just some things that are not going to work without some changes and take the appropriate action. Have you tried running a script that uses  Best Pactics, or WSUS? This is a no-go with PowerShell 7.  Fortunately, that issue is now gone with the block list for import-module. \r\n\r\nTo say 'a lot of scripts' are going to be affected - this possibly a gross overstatement. I've been working on a book, and it is not the case that \"a lot\" of scripts break. I have only found three modules to be actually problematic. And the existing 5.1 scripts that do remoting actually work better than I expected - that is to say pretty much flawlessly. \r\n\r\nIf you are writing scripts using remoting, would you really NOT know about what an endpoint is and how it works? If you are writing production scripts that depend on remoting, then yes you really should understand remoting and what an endpoint is. All the more so if you are going to use JEA. One of the first things I teach students in the Remoting module is what an endpoint is. I draw it out and my students do understand it quite easily.  \r\n\r\nHere's what I feel should happen:\r\n\r\n1. PowerShell 7 should be installed with some default end-points, just like versions of Windows PowerShell did. One should not need to use Enable-PSRemoting to get these to exist. \r\n\r\n2. The output of Get-PSSessionConfiguration should be identical for both PowerShell 7 and 5.1. It currently is not. And it would be nice to have Get-PSSessonConfiguration did not need an elevated console to run.\r\n\r\n3. The help text needs to be improved - the help for enter-PSSession makes NO mention of suddenly being a different version.  The text has to make clear what is happening. Currently, it's not clear that a downlevel endpoint is being chosen and why that matters (and how to fix it).\r\n\r\n4. Ensure that if a downlevel endpoint IS to be used, then it should be visible with Get-PSSessionConfiguration. Try to do the following in PowerShell 7\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$hostname = hostname\r\nGet-PSSessionConfiguration\r\nEnter-PSSession -ComputerName $hostname\r\n$Psversiontable\r\n```\r\nIF you have not run Enable-PSRemoting, you see ZERO endpoints, but you do enter the session. If you have enabled remoting, you see THREE (PS7) endpoints, but when you enter the 'default' it's a _different_ endpoint. That is both inconsistent and illogical.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, if I do the same thing in PowerShell 5.1 I get different results. First, in 5.1 I see ALL the endpoints (Not just current version ones), secondly, by default, if I enter-PSSession I see an endpoint of the same version, not some other version. \r\n\r\nIn summary, I do not believe the current implementation presents a consistent and logical default installation for remoting. And given the added importance of remoting in PWSH, this needs to be resolved prior to RTM.\r\n\r\n",

Some thoughts:\r\n\r\n- `Get-PSSessionConfiguration` should be enhanced to be able to run remotely so you can discover configurations for remote endpoints.  This means that `Get-PSSessionConfiguration` should show everything so when used remotely, it doesn't matter if you connect to 5.1 or 7.\r\n- I think that for most customers, they expect to establish a connection to the same major version of the PowerShell they are using by default.\r\n- We should have some policy and/or setting to define the default endpoint a client connects to if not specified.\r\n- I'm of the opinion that for most customers, what they care about is establishing A connection and not a SPECIFIC connection, so a fallback strategy makes sense to me and output a Warning message if connecting to something other than a version that matches the client\r\n- @JamesWTruher proposed adding a note property that indicates the PSVersion for remote objects similar to how we add PSComputerName\r\n",

I assume in powershell.config.json. Is a group policy needed to set this for wider deployment?\r\n- Regarding the warning - well in a way that would be consistent with importing a module via PSCompat - you get a warning there too.\r\n- Note property - yes, please!\r\n\r\nI do have a small concern over what will go into 7.0. I believe this needs to be in 7.0.  My concern is that that means it won't get quite as wide testing as an RC (and I am the last person to want yet another RC!). I think these changes are fairly simple - but then what do I know about that!\r\n",

    "body": "Wanted to post some of my thoughts from last week, as we had a very long discussion regarding this one in the @PowerShell/powershell-committee, and we wanted to let this one churn a little. \r\n\r\nI should note that at this point there's no way this making 7.0, and would have to be something that's changed for 7.1. \r\n\r\nLeaving aside Windows PS 2.x for a second, in a pre-Core world, Windows PowerShell would always remote into the \"latest version\" on a box because there could only be one version on the box. This was one of the historical problems with Windows PowerShell and WMF: upgrading your OS or version of PowerShell was an operation that moved your entire machine forward. \r\n\r\nAs such, we did our best to maintain backwards compatibility in new versions so that users could take advantage of new features and bug fixes without breaking their existing scripts. This was a lot easier given the strong backwards compatibility of .NET Framework, but even with Core, we've invested heavily over the last couple years to achieve a high level of backwards compatibility with Windows PowerShell so that users can migrate more easily. \r\n\r\nBut of course, in neither case were we perfect. Our guidance was always that *admins who owned the servers* should validate their workloads with new versions of Windows Server and/or Windows PowerShell in a test or staging environment, so that they could be sure that updating wouldn't break them. \r\n\r\nThe key point here is that the server admin was making the conscious decision to change the runtime for the server: both in the local server case, as well as the server remoting endpoint case (because at that point in time they were the same thing). \r\n\r\nToday, the admin still has complete control over the server endpoint. They can:\r\n* turn on/off WinRM remoting completely for Windows PowerShell and/or PowerShell Core/7\r\n* set the default `microsoft.powershell` endpoint to any PowerShell they choose\r\n* create arbitrary WinRM endpoints that point to specific side-by-side versions\r\n* leverage SSH remoting for PowerShell 7\r\n\r\nTo that end, we're not talking about any kind of blocker. Given the proper configuration, all scenarios are possible (if this isn't accurate, my apologies, please call one out). \r\n\r\nAre some of these a complete pain to do today? Absolutely, especially considering that `Get-PSSessionConfiguration` is explicitly filtering out Windows PowerShell endpoints (a decision that I believe can be traced to very naive decision-making on my and others' part in an earlier version of Core). \r\n\r\n**We should fix that. As noted above, we should also fix `Get-PSSessionConfiguration` so that it works remotely and you can discover available server endpoints.**\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't think changing the default is prudent for a couple reasons:\r\n* The fallback logic is \"magic\" that will require admins who *are* updating their WinRM endpoints to understand additional complexity (e.g. if I want to force clients to default to entering via Windows PS on my server, but still leave remoting on for PS 7, I have to rename the PS 7 endpoints to anything other than the default name).\r\n* Backwards compatibility is still a top, top concern, and there are some scripts that will continue to not work when moved to 7. Given the historical pain of updating Windows PowerShell, we made a pretty strong guarantee that deploying Core/7 is a side-by-side operation, and will not impact your Windows PowerShell workloads. (You can find some of this language in [my 6.0 release blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-core-6-0-generally-available-ga-and-supported/), and something similar in the [6.0 release notes](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-core-60#support-for-side-by-side-installations), but this is something I've spoken to in presentations and with customers for years now.)\r\n\r\n**I also propose that we add a switch to the MSI to enable admins to easily \"set PowerShell 7 as the default endpoint.** This would allow admins to force Windows PowerShell clients to use PowerShell 7 as the default endpoint on the Server, something much more akin to the way that SSH remoting works, where the default shell can be set by the admin, irrespective of the shell in which the client is executing `ssh`. (Though it was also raised in our meeting that you can override the default shell as an SSH client, of course requiring that said shell exists on the remote side. While not perfect, this is somewhat of a parallel to the WinRM clients passing an endpoint configuration name.) As a piece of implementation detail, this checkbox should also probably rename the existing `microsoft.powershell` endpoint (if it exists) to something like `microsoft.powershell.5` or `microsoft.windows.powershell`. \r\n\r\nI know this seems frustrating to some that are living on the cutting edge, where they're able to move to PowerShell 7 across their entire client- and server-side environments. But the \"principle of least surprise\", as @essentialexch referred to it, is something that's very important to us. PS Core and 7 were created to be side-by-side because we wanted to enable admins and users to make separate parts of the journey upwards as they are ready. We really want to get away from this idea that upgrading is an all-or-nothing approach. Even if an endpoint fallback partially solves that issue, it's still something that will surprise any users who may have deployed PS 7 to their servers under the banner that it wouldn't affect whatever was working yesterday. \r\n\r\nAnd while **we have absolutely no plans to do this** (and as I know @SteveL-MSFT agrees, I would prefer to never do this), all of that leaves aside what the heck we would do if there ever future incompatible versions of PowerShell (like an 8.0). Introducing magic fallback logic just feels like we're painting ourselves into a corner. \r\n\r\nI should note that this isn't a definitive answer on this issue, and the @PowerShell/powershell-committee still wants to talk more about the proper solution. But I wanted to lay out my thoughts to provide a framework for others to provide their feedback. ",
