    "body": "After thorough debate, the cmdlet WG concluded: \r\nA platform-specific feature for which a native command exists generally is easily accessible from within PowerShell as-is. For example, it is trivial on a Windows system to use shutdown.exe in a PowerShell script. \r\nUsing native commands may not be easily discoverable, though: the PowerShell help system wouldn't suggest this native command or provide help. This part could indeed be solved by adding the functionality to a core cmdlet.\r\nOn the down side, this would decrease consistency and user experience on non-targeted systems though. \r\nSo for platform specific features, the cmdlet WG recommends to continue to directly use appropriate native commands provided by the particular platform on the platforms where it is available. If additional PowerShell-specific functionality like risk mitigation (-whatif) etc is needed - native commands can easily be wrapped inside a PowerShell function. \r\nFor these reasons, the issue was closed, and we hope our reasoning resonates with the community.",
