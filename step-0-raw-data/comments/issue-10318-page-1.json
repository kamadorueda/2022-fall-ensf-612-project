    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT The two Pester errors that occur on each platform happen because `Fabrikam-ServerScript` in `www.poshtestgallery.com` defines a workflow. Since workflow does not parse with this PR in place, and since PowerShellGet wasn't designed with deprecated features that generate parse errors in mind, there's a chicken-and-egg problem with these tests.\r\n\r\nSince I can use `Find-Script` in the same PowerShellGet module in a build with this PR to find the script and pull script metadata, which includes workflows that are in the script, we could update PowerShellGet to check for the presence of workflow as part of `Install-Script` (the information is obviously retrievable, and if workflow is found), and prevent the installation from continuing since it is not supported on 7.0+. We could then update the failing tests to verify that scenario fails properly, and to test that installing a different script that does not have workflow works. This will allow the Pester tests to pass.\r\n\r\nLonger term, we could also update PowerShellGet to recognize parser errors about deprecated keywords. The parser error that is being generated by the parser in this PR is very specific, and clearly identifies when a keyword is deprecated. The keyword token also has a flag indicating that it is deprecated. In the case where a deprecated keyword is found, PowerShellGet could simply ignore that error since it shouldn't care.\r\n\r\nYou can see both the descriptive error id and the keyword `Deprecated` flag in the output below:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS C:\\> $tokens = $null\r\n>> $errors = $null\r\n>> [System.Management.Automation.Language.Parser]::ParseInput(\r\n>>     'workflow foo {''bar''}; Get-Date',\r\n>>      [ref]$tokens,\r\n>>      [ref]$errors)\r\n\r\nAttributes         : {}\r\nUsingStatements    : {}\r\nParamBlock         :\r\nBeginBlock         :\r\nProcessBlock       :\r\nEndBlock           : workflow foo {'bar'}; Get-Date\r\nDynamicParamBlock  :\r\nScriptRequirements :\r\nExtent             : workflow foo {'bar'}; Get-Date\r\nParent             :\r\n\r\n\r\nPS C:\\> $errors | fl *\r\n\r\nExtent          : workflow\r\nErrorId         : DeprecatedKeywordNotAllowed\r\nMessage         : The 'workflow' keyword has been deprecated and is no longer supported.\r\nIncompleteInput : False\r\n\r\n\r\nPS C:\\> $tokens\r\n\r\nText       : workflow\r\nTokenFlags : Keyword, Deprecated\r\nKind       : Workflow\r\nHasError   : False\r\nExtent     : workflow\r\n\r\nText       : foo\r\nTokenFlags : CommandName\r\nKind       : Identifier\r\nHasError   : False\r\nExtent     : foo\r\n\r\nText       : {\r\nTokenFlags : ParseModeInvariant\r\nKind       : LCurly\r\nHasError   : False\r\nExtent     : {\r\n\r\nValue      : bar\r\nText       : 'bar'\r\nTokenFlags : ParseModeInvariant\r\nKind       : StringLiteral\r\nHasError   : False\r\nExtent     : 'bar'\r\n\r\nText       : }\r\nTokenFlags : ParseModeInvariant\r\nKind       : RCurly\r\nHasError   : False\r\nExtent     : }\r\n\r\nText       : ;\r\nTokenFlags : ParseModeInvariant\r\nKind       : Semi\r\nHasError   : False\r\nExtent     : ;\r\n\r\nValue      : Get-Date\r\nText       : Get-Date\r\nTokenFlags : CommandName\r\nKind       : Generic\r\nHasError   : False\r\nExtent     : Get-Date\r\n\r\nText       :\r\nTokenFlags : ParseModeInvariant\r\nKind       : EndOfInput\r\nHasError   : False\r\nExtent     :\r\n\r\n\r\nPS C:\\>\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease let me know how you would like to proceed.",

    "body": "If we do want these keywords deprecated, the simple solution for PowerShellGet is to check if a script/module has workflow in it _before_ installing it, and prevent that installation from happening if that is the case in PowerShell 7+. That's logical, necessary, and the right thing to do. Users can still save the script, which does not do any parsing checks, and that is the most they would want to do in a version of PowerShell that doesn't support workflow anyway. They shouldn't be able to install a script that is incompatible even with -Force (why would I be able to install something I can't use -- installers prevent such things, and rightly so). Since that change should probably happen regardless, and since that change fixes these issues, we could move forward with little effort with that change plus splitting the tests in question into two, so that they test for success and failure when it comes to workflow.",

This PR was dependent on another issue (issue [PowerShell/PowerShellGet#528](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/528)). That issue disappeared. I didn't delete it, so how do we find out what happened to that???\r\n1. Assuming that issue gets recovered (or relogged), this PR can't be finished until that issue is addressed (which obviously won't happen if the issue that was logged was deleted).\r\n\r\nThat is why this was marked WIP: because it is dependent on an issue that I just discovered is missing. I'd like to know what happened to that issue, because issues should not be deleted.",
