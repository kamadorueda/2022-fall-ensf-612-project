That's solved pretty easily with argument transformation, but it's more work.  Really there aren't many reasons to enumerate the values outside of help and tab completion so usually it's not worth the trouble.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAlso now it would be a breaking change as `HashCmdletBase` is publicly inheritable.",
