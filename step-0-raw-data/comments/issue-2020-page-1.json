The Travis CI infrastructure makes Ubuntu 14.04 available; not Ubuntu 16.04. \"Release\" packages for Ubuntu 16.04 are available under [releases](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases), and packages can be automatically created using [Docker](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/docker). \n\nUntil #2263 is resolved and more official containers are uploaded, if you _need_ immediate access to nightly Ubuntu 16.04 packages, you can try the tag [unstable-ubuntu16.04](https://hub.docker.com/r/andschwa/powershell/tags/) from my personal fork's automated builds (these are obviously provided as-is). This container has a nightly package installed, and moreover, the package file itself is left inside the container, available to be copied out.\n",
