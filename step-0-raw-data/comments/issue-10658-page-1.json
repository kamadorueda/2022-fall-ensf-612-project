Why you don't change the parameter name from \"-Encoding\" to \"-Encode\"? Because the reason is that PS 5 and older scripts want be work. \r\nSo please tell me the reason to change a running system to a system what brings so many issues for end users.

The general consensus is that it's not worth adding the BOM to UTF8 files.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, we're here now. And while I appreciate it might be an inconvenience to you to have to update your scripts, I don't think one person is a sufficient driving force to change the standard for all of PowerShell.\r\n\r\nIf it makes life difficult for you, you can easily set your own defaults for these parameters in a profile script or simply add one easy line to affected scripts to set the default for those scripts using my previous suggestion. 🙂 ",

It doesn't come up with the argument completer, it's not listed in the help.  So people are no longer told about \"Default\" And if people want the default Ansi code page they can put `1252` or `$ExecutionContext.Host.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ANSICodePage`\r\n\r\n**But** there is undocumented support for \"default\", which seems specifically so that old scripts don't break. Either that should go,  or it should keep those old scripts working in the way they used to work. Silently changing \"default\" mean what most people would expect is wrong. \r\n\r\nIt's one place. In EncodingUtils.cs there is this\r\n```\r\ninternal static Dictionary<string, Encoding> encodingMap = new Dictionary<string, Encoding>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)\r\n        {\r\n            { Ascii, System.Text.Encoding.ASCII },\r\n            { BigEndianUnicode, System.Text.Encoding.BigEndianUnicode },\r\n            { Default, ClrFacade.GetDefaultEncoding() },\r\n            { OEM, ClrFacade.GetOEMEncoding() },\r\n            { Unicode, System.Text.Encoding.Unicode },\r\n            { Utf7, System.Text.Encoding.UTF7 },\r\n            { Utf8, ClrFacade.GetDefaultEncoding() },\r\n            { Utf8Bom, System.Text.Encoding.UTF8 },\r\n            { Utf8NoBom, ClrFacade.GetDefaultEncoding() },\r\n            { Utf32, System.Text.Encoding.UTF32 },\r\n            { String, System.Text.Encoding.Unicode },\r\n            { Unknown, System.Text.Encoding.Unicode },\r\n        };\r\n     \r\n```\r\nEither delete the \"default\" entry and make people re-write to get the old behaviour or replace it with a suitable  `System.Text.Encoding.something`  which will give the old behaviour (without documenting it).  \r\n\r\n",

That would be a very good and especially and easy usability and on top, the end user can easy see on the name of the value what it means.\r\n\r\nOr can you add a value for ANSI like `ANSI` and implement it with the code from @jhoneil\r\n`{ ANSI, System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(Host.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ANSICodePage) },`\r\n\r\nThank you.",

At this point, no further changes are planned to be made.\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT \r\nThat means / you will say that \"to enable PowerShell Core for the broader community\" means you have to change the value \"default\" in the parameter \"_Encoding\" because to enable PS Core for a broader Community?!\r\nPlease read your own sentence again, that makes zero sence! Since WinPS there was a value \"UTF8\" for param \"-Encoding\" so it makes zero sence to change it with Core so that value \"default\" do exactly the same like \"UTF8\". \r\n\r\nAnd you would have reached the wider community if I had left the value \"Default\" on OS Encoding setting. Then you would reach even more in the community because it would be even more flexible as before and even more as it is now. Now there are 2 different values that the same do but no longer value to ANSI encoded. For all those who want to encode to ANSI it gets totally complicated starting with PS Core.\r\nThanks for opening PS Core to the broad community.\r\n\r\nSorry but you to a very big mistake on basic thinks! If this is how PS core gose to, than i have to tell all my customers to don't use PS Core because it is not longer a descendant of Powershell and not compatible to WinPS at all.\r\n\r\nThank you!",

It uses [`GetOEMCP`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winnls/nf-winnls-getoemcp) to get the current OEM code page identifier for the OS on windows platform.\r\n\r\nyes but it is still not compatible with WinPS 5.1 an older.\r\n\r\nIn this blog post [https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/the-next-release-of-powershell-powershell-7/](url) from @SteveL-MSFT he was written the follow:\r\n\r\n> This means that Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core users will be able to use the same version of PowerShell to automate across Windows, Linux, and macOS and on Windows, and PowerShell 7 users will have a very high level of compatibility with Windows PowerShell modules they rely on today.\r\n\r\nSo with the current situation, the statement of @SteveL-MSFT is wrong. \r\nI can run a script where i have `-Encoding default` inside with WinPS5.1 and PS Core but the result is totally different.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have run a script with `-Encoding default` for a long time in WinPS 5.1 and the file what was created via the script was encoded very well in ANSI. This file was hand over to a 3. party application (this application needs the data in ANSI) which imports the data.\r\n\r\nSince I have run the exact same script with PS Core, half of the 45000 employee data sets the 3. party application imported were destroyed and the employee can't work in this application. Thats because of this big bug / issue in PS Core. \r\n\r\nOnce again, don't think only as a developer, think more as end user who use this application maybe since PS 3.0 (in this version the -Encoding default was implemented).\r\n\r\nIn my case, more than 20000 employee base data in the shift planing system was destroyed and my client was very angry. Till i found the issue i takes 1,5 days. In this 1,5 days this more than 20000 employees can't book ther times or request absences and stuff like this.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, there must not be such changes in PS Core and these changes contradict the official statements that PS Core is compatible with WinPS.\r\n\r\nMaybe for the developers of Powershell Core it is not a big deal, to change some simple thinks like this, but for the people who use Powershell Core it is a big change and let break the scripts who use stuff like this.\r\n\r\nAnd the more crazy thing for me is why it is so hard for the dev team of PS Core and Microsoft to understand this and why theye can not admit that it was a mistake to make that change and say ok, we'll undo that change.",

    "body": "> @PowerShell/powershell-committee discussed this. Despite the pain of `Default` having different meanings on Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core, we made a deliberate decision to enable cross platform support of PowerShell Core for the broader community. At this point, no further changes are planned to be made.\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT could you clarify what you mean by \"a deliberate decision to enable cross platform support\".  \r\n\r\nNeither the on-line help nor intellisense suggest \"default\". _No one should ever use `-encoding default` in code written for PowerShell 6 or 7,_ so it isn't a cross platform issue, as far as I can see.   \r\n\r\nI get the feeling that @Skybeat  manages systems which aren't running in English, and \"default\" gets the right code page but \"ASCII\" does not, a problem someone working in English doesn't have.   \r\n\r\nThere is one line of code in PowerShell core which seems to be there to ensure that if a script author put ` -encoding \"default\"` in a scripts for PowerShell 3,4,5 it doesn't throw an error don't throw an error, on 6 & 7. But, it appears that the person who put that line in did not understand that \"default\" here didn't mean what it usually means. Form @Skybeat 's point of view that misunderstanding means **New PowerShell = Corrupt Output.** \r\n\r\nDeleting that one line would force anyone using \"default\" to get their national code page to make a change, and changing it as I outlined in a previous post would all @Skybeat  's produced the expected out put. Either this was not clear to committee when it was discussed, or if was the benefit of silently corrupting output if a legacy choice is selected needs a little more explanation.\r\n",

Now I have asked my colleagues who uses the code \"Set-Content -Encoding default\" in their scripts. Everyone uses it.\r\nNow imagine the scriptre with such erroneous behavior, e.g. be used in banking or social work.\r\nCould you as a developer really not look over the counter and think of any effects before you start discussing something that is not worth discussing as it has been rooted in Powershell way too long?\r\nHave you ever considered discussing it with end users and listening to it before you know better about making such significant changes?\r\n\r\nSorry if I say so directly but it's a shame how you deal with the end users. You leave them alone with the problem and mistakes that you know and which have been reported to you.\r\nYou come with more and more excuses just to not have to admit a mistake and as always the users have to be this discharge and stand straight for it.

As far as anyone here knows, you are the only person  impacted by this.  You say 25 people in your company use `set-content -encoding default.` If you ask them what it does , how many would say selecting a different code page ? Can any of them can give an example of something which will break if they put ASCII or UTF8 . \r\n When you talk \"about millions of data in thousands of companies\" (which assumes that those companies switch from Windows PowerShell to PowerShell core without testing their scripts first) _but_ no-one else has reported the problem, so it reads like the ranting of a crazy person and instead of helping you people ignore a crazy person. You took a dependency on an old mistake and the fix creates extra work for you (like testing), people should be sympathetic but again, ranting crazy people don't get sympathy. \r\n\r\nto the short post. Yes. you can over-ride it with a proxy function. If the version is >5 replace \"default\" with a code page. Done properly it will generate a warning when it does that so you get told where to check your scripts.\r\n",
