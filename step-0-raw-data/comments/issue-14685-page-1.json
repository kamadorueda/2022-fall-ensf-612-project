Jsut because the user maybe not interested in the parameter set name, its presence would not be deterimental to them, so in a way I don't understand the reticence. That issue has been opened a while now but not addressed or closed, so what' s gonna happen to it?\r\n\r\nParameter set resolution is difficult as it is and we need some way to help debug these issues.\r\n",

    "body": "As for the meta problem: It's always a good question as to what happens to old, seemingly abandoned proposals. Renewed interest, even via an accidental duplicate or near-duplicate may revive the discussion, but it's important to (a) link to old proposals and (b) agree on where the discussion should continue.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that the reticence is around two aspects:\r\n\r\n* Parameter-set names are considered an implementation detail, not public information - though I don't think it would be a problem to expose them, because they do carry useful information even for the end user, even though the need to show them may be more pressing for developers.\r\n\r\n   * As long as no one expects these names to be part of a public contract, I don't think showing them is problematic.\r\n\r\n* Syntax-diagram output would get longer by 1-2 lines _per parameter set_, which with `-?` could make them (partially) scroll off screen in smaller windows and even with `Get-Command -Syntax` may no longer fit on a single screen.\r\n\r\nEven if the parameter-set names were _not_ to be shown with `-?`, `Get-Help`, and only shown with `Get-Command -Syntax` and possibly also `Get-Help -Full`, what is unequivocally helpful to both end users and developers is to highlight the _unique_ parameters in each parameter set, as suggested @bpayette [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6856#issuecomment-388473915) (a comment that also makes the two points above).",
