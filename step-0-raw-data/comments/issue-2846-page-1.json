Now that we'll be creating \"cross-platform\" scripts, there must be a way to Windows PowerShell scripts in a PowerShell Open Source environment.\r\n\r\nIn the above image, in PowerShell v6.0.0.0-Alpha_13, I'm trying to execute an SMO Script that can only run in Windows PowerShell v5.x (so it has the \"#requires -version 5.0\".  The results is, PowerShell 6 ignores the '#requires -version' statement and try to run the SMO script.\r\n\r\nIn the other console, is Windows PowerShell but I just change the \"#requires -version\" from 5 to 6.  This was just the prevent the script to run.

The results is, PowerShell 6 ignores the '#requires -version' statement and try to run the SMO script.\r\n\r\nFirstly PSv6 doesn't \"ignore\" the requires statement at all due to the fact that it's not specifying that it will only run in the version specified but all versions beyond that one. So any and all scripts that have #Requires -version will work in versions of PowerShell beyond the version specified - therefore PowerShell v6.0.0.13 does respect this when you specify `#Requires -Version 5.0` as v6.0.0.13 is a higher version to v5. If you had specified `#Requires -Version 3.0` then that would means that the script will be able to run in PowerShell v3, v4, v5, v5.1 & v6 but it will not run in v1 or v2. To confirm this please check the about_requires help text.\r\n\r\nIf you have a script that you don't think will run in PowerShell v6 then I would suggest to adapt the below and place it at the top of the script so that it runs first and place the rest of the scripts logic within the else statement\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nif ($iscoreclr) \r\n{Write-Warning 'This script will only run on the FullCLR version of PowerShell which is only currently available on Windows, Please rerun this script in the Full Version of PowerShell.'; break}\r\nelse\r\n{'Full'}\r\n```\r\nThis added to a script will check for the iscoreclr variable and if its true (on all current versions of PSv6 regardless of the OS it runs on including Windows) will stop the script from processing and provide the user a sensible warning message.\r\n\r\nI do recall a discussion (however I cannot find it now) where it was put forward that it may be benefit in extending the requires statement to include a max version so that you could include something like this as your requires statement\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n#Requires -Version 5.0\r\n#Requires -MaxVersion 5.9\r\n```\r\nWhich of course would stop it running on PSv6 completely.\r\n\r\nI hope that has helped :-)",
