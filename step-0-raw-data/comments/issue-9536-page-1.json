Now there are mainly documentation issues. Since we are generating XML documentation, we should fix such issues as well. We could create something like \"continues documentations\" so that the XML documentation transparently flows into Docs repo. Therefore, I never wanted to turn off doc issues in CodeFactor. (Although if we turn this off we will have very few reported issues)\r\nOn the other hand, Codacy also sometimes looks very strange. There are sometimes false positives.\r\nTogether they (CodeFActor and Codacy) would be good.",
