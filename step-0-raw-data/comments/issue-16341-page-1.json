    "body": "Looks like when a variable value is `AutomationNull.Value`, as can happen in error cases, the `-notlike` and `-notmatch` operators don't evaluate at all, no value is returned:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\n$autoNull = [System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value\r\n$autoNull -notlike 'aaaa' # no output\r\n$autoNull -notmatch 'aaaa' # no output\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo as a result they register as \"false\" in an if statement, because nothing is returned from the expression. I can see why this might occur, but it's unclear what the \"correct\" behaviour would be here, to me.",
