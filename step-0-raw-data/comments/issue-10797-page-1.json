So some possibilities I can imagine possibilities are:\r\n\r\n- We forget about writing warnings, since it's a small addition externally but a big change to the code, is hard to test and doesn't work well with how the parser is designed\r\n- We turn them into runtime ~~errors~~ **warnings** by checking the `ScriptRequirements` property on the AST when it's run\r\n- We make it easier for the static parser instance to pick up the current runspace and write warnings to streams\r\n- We look into what the right test hook solution would be",
