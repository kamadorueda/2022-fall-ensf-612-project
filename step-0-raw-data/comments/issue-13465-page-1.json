E.g. \"The intent was to make AutomationNull as invisible to script users as possible\". Ok sure, but PS is returning an [AutomationNull] result to me, and I'm trying to confirm that, and the response is \"you're not meant to use that\"? So why return it then if I'm not meant to use it? Feels like the PS team is more than happy shifting the burden onto the end user as a 'fix' for this issue.",
