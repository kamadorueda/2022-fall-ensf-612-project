(which it was, just not at the machine I'm working on.) \r\n- If your module folder is big loading PowerShell can take a (very) long time because it will wait until OneDrive has pulled all the files to your machine.\r\n\r\nI think this change should happen... hopefully soon. I think storage for these modules should be in the `%userpfile%\\AppData\\Local` folder, this is the place for things that should not get synced with other machines.\r\n\r\nPS: I create PowerShell modules... I have a lot of them... and they are all on my OneDrive now. ðŸ˜’ ",

This should indeed go there too, but don't you think they will choose the location of the modules where they install them... based on whatever this teams says it should be?  (AFAIK there's no way to customize this with settings, but that's something for another day.)\r\n\r\nIf paths for _loading_ the modules is the primary function of `PSModulePath`, this issue can be solved quite easily:\r\n1. Designate a folder somewhere in `%LocalAppData%\\...` \r\n2. Tell others that installing modules in this folder is best practice.\r\n3. Put _both_ paths in `PSModulePath` (i.e. `%LocalAppData%\\..`  and `%userprofile%\\Documents\\...`)\r\n4. Ensure the new location is added to new installations in the PSModulePath environment variable.\r\n\r\nNo need to move stuff around, new things get installed in `%LocalAppData%\\..` and old modules that are still in the user's documents folder keep working. Maybe this doesn't even require a code change in PowerShell, just some changes in the installer.\r\n\r\nAnd now we're on this subject, in Windows installations, modules which are installed on the local machine are installed by default in the `Program files\\PowerShell\\Modules` folder. I think the correct place for this should be `%AllUsersProfile%\\...` (often called `C:\\ProgramData`) \r\n\r\nAFAIK the functionality of `PSModulePath` itself doesn't change with all of this, so this is technically not a breaking change.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.",

    "body": "So we reviewed this on the @PowerShell/powershell-committee today, but also this is something I've personally done some thinking on in the past.\r\n\r\nThe mangling on particular locations on the PSModulePath is something we've seen users impacted by repeatedly. For example: https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/2824#issuecomment-667355371.\r\n\r\nAnother important point is that the CurrentUser and AllUsers module paths are actually configurable in the powershell.config.json:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/e2c23fc5bd035251bed71413ad7c467c99dafd76/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/ModuleIntrinsics.cs#L1304-L1305\r\n\r\nSo there is a concept of both the *default* CurrentUser module path and the actual one.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's currently no way to communicate the actual one, so the default is the implicit contract between PowerShell's module system (`Import-Module`/`Get-Module`/command lookup) and PowerShellGet. I was hoping to improve that in #7082, but even without that the contact being implicit means there's room to get it wrong.\r\n\r\nToday it seems that both PowerShell 7 and PowerShellGet agree that the default CurrentUser module path lies under the `MyDocuments` path, but evidence suggests that this wasn't always the case.\r\n\r\nThe big issue now is that OneDrive configurations override the MyDocuments folder and cause this unexpected migration.\r\n\r\nBut additionally, the actual CurrentUsers module path could be overridden with a configuration. And this is something that things like the PowerShell Azure Functions worker would want to do given the radically different environment in which it operates. Except that there's no way for PowerShellGet to pick this up.\r\n\r\nIn terms of changing the default PSModulePath, there have been a lot of proposals to fix PSModulePath in various ways. Changing the CurrentUser path away from MyDocuments is going to break PowerShellGet, since it depends on the same location being used. However, the MyDocuments path clearly presents problems, and both the proposed alternatives (`$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\PowerShell\\Modules` and `$HOME\\PowerShell\\Modules`) make sense.\r\n\r\nSo in terms of recommendations:\r\n\r\n- The Engine Working Group has also been asked to review this, to go into a bit more technical depth.\r\n- An API of some kind that gives both the default and actual module path components is probably a good direction to go in.\r\n- In terms of backward compatibility, tooling can look for this API and fall back to the traditional defaults.\r\n- The committee didn't decide on whether or not the default path should be changed. We want a chance for the Engine WG to discuss this, and also want to talk to the OneDrive team to understand things a bit better here.",

The tool chain also needs to be able to query PS so the values are consistent.\r\n\r\nWe propose that an RFC is needed to define the behaviors, not only for PowerShell proper but for tools like PowerShellGet.\r\n\r\nWe think at least the following requirements need to be addressed in the RFC:\r\n- where is the default location for PSModulePath (system and/or user)\r\n- how may this default location be modified\r\n- how is the API used by PS and the other tools\r\n- how are misconfigurations handled (non-existing paths, multiple paths, etc)",

    "body": "> Would a dot folder work here possibly?\r\n\r\nAs @rkeithhill said, those dot folders pollute `$HOME`, and even though they're not displayed, they still need to be processed by programs that examine the Home directory, creating a sort of tragedy-of-the-commons problem where more and more applications putting their configurations and data in a directory based in the Home directory adds up to slower filesystem performance for unrelated tasks.\r\n\r\nPowerShell actually already conforms to the [XDG base directory specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) on *nix, which is a standard intended to solve this problem. PowerShell data files, including modules, are stored in `$env:XDG_DATA_HOME/powershell`, which defaults to `$HOME/.local/share/powershell`.\r\n\r\nThe issue then is that Windows doesn't really offer a clear answer here, because its philosophy is to separate users from configurers/application installers.\r\n\r\nWorth noting is that the XDG standard is configurable with a sensible default, and I imagine we want the same, we just need to weigh configurability against complexity (mainly for anyone developing against our decision) and performance.",

[This seems to work well for me](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/configuration-of-the-my-documents-folder-dfd9a90d-8f80-18d6-e7cc-f1566fc3b10b):\r\n\r\n1. Right-click My Documents (on the desktop), and then click Properties.\r\n2. In the Target box, type the new path to the My Documents folder, or click Move to browse to the folder and if needed, create a new My Documents folder. If the path you type does not exist, you are prompted to confirm that you want to create a new folder.\r\n3. Click ~Yes to move files from the old My Documents location to the new location, or~ click No if you do not want to move these files. Note that if you click No, the files in the old location are not deleted, but they are no longer visible from My Documents after the change. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6683266/147690043-76892c7e-82dc-48cb-9b33-7229a46c0abe.png)\r\n\r\nFigured I'd share this in case anyone needed it /shrug",

Our IT Apps department wants to start migrating things from legacy systems to newer PowerShell scripts, but they can't install the modules needed because Defender gets in the way, and they don't have admin access on their systems (only IT Operations have that).  I'd rather not blanket exclude powershell.exe / pwsh.exe from controlled folder access (which is what Microsoft Support told me I'd need to do), as that sounds like a Very Bad Idea (tm).  I suppose I could deploy scripts via Intune that would install modules in AllUser scope, but that'd then require me to manage their module updates as well, and ideally the user should be able to manage their own modules.",

The ideal solution is:\r\n\r\n1. expose a public API in SMA.dll for apps to discover the system, shared, and user module paths.  Even our own modules like PowerShellGet are currently hardcoded to Documents (on Windows anyways)\r\n2. ideally, $env:PSModulePath is JUST an env var and pwsh.exe doesn't manipulate it trying to infer user intentions (this was inherited behavior form powershell.exe), however, this would be a breaking change.  Basically, if certain system, shared, and user paths are not in the env var, PowerShell assumes this was a mistake and adds them except for some specific conditions\r\n3. the actual location would probably be AppData on Windows.  On non-Windows, it's already outside of Documents.  Do we need a migration story for users with PS7 already installed?  A clean install is easy, but an existing PS7 means modules are likely already in Documents.  Seems to me a cmdlet to explicitly migrate may be best solution to avoid any surprises to the user.\r\n\r\nOpen to ideas/thoughts on this.",

    "body": "Engine WG discussed this issue today\r\n\r\n### Points raised by the committee\r\n\r\nWe fully agree that SMA.dll should offer better insights into module path preferences through its public API surface - it's currently too opaque, and .\r\n\r\nWe also generally agree that PowerShell should, long-term, move towards `$env:LOCALAPPDATA` as the _preferred_ root for user-specific application data (modules included) on Windows, but certainly **not** as a breaking change. \r\nInstead, we recommend a \"slow march\" approach - establish and introduce a new path root, switch official host application logic defaults gradually, and continue supporting both paths for module discovery in parallel. \r\n\r\nGiven the scope and expected impact of introducing a change like this (however carefully), the proposal should indeed be published as an RFC, and evaluated in the larger context of the ecosystem around PowerShell (tooling with hardcoded module paths, etc.). We don't have capacity to commit to producing the initial draft, but welcome additional input from the community and the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n### `XDG_DATA_HOME`\r\n\r\nWe further discussed @Jaykul's suggestion to support `$env:XDG_DATA_HOME` for establishing a user-defined path root for PowerShell-specific user data. \r\n\r\nWe agree on its potential usefulness, but recommend **not** implementing support for `$env:XDG_DATA_HOME` in isolation. Instead, we would like to evaluate the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) holistically, and then give a more comprehensive recommendation on whether (and how) to support it consistently on Windows - please create a separate issue for this if that sounds valuable @Jaykul, we're happy to re-review it :) ",

OneDrive does not follow them, but they are transparent to most use cases.\r\n\r\nIIUC, if you do `New-Item -ItemType Junction ~\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules -Value ~\\SomeOtherFolder\\Modules`, you're good.\r\n\r\nWe are junctioning individual module folders within `Modules`, and that breaks PowerShellGet's update functionality in PSv5 due to `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` in PackageManagement\\Get-Package, because `gci` doesn't traverse junctions within the provided path with `-Recurse`. (PSv7 does.) To work around that, we copy the `PSGetModuleInfo.xml` files back. PackageManagement then finds the XML files and uses the `InstalledLocation` property, which is junction-agnostic.\r\n\r\nWe didn't use symbolic links because they require admin to create on Windows.",
