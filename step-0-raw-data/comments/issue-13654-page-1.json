    "body": "So I had a look into this and the code that is generating this error is not in PowerShell but the native WSMan API that PowerShell is calling. You can verify this by finding that exact same error message in `C:\\Windows\\System32\\en-US\\WsmRes.dll.mui`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/93659119-4d23af00-fa85-11ea-93c9-e8f889488f52.png)\r\n\r\nSo PowerShell is effectively calling https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/3effa204103460c996a8612aa70718fdf924047d/src/Microsoft.WSMan.Management/ConfigProvider.cs#L2689 and the exception from this is what you are seeing in the error message. PowerShell can't do much about this as the check is performed in a dll not owned by this team so @vexx32 suggestion is the next step https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13654#issuecomment-694944801.\r\n\r\nFor your actual issue, you shouldn't ever really set this config option to `True`. Unless you are using a 3rd party WinRM library that doesn't support message encryption over NTLM or Kerberos then your only real option is to use HTTPS as you've pointed out. By having to set this to `True` any data that is exchanged will be in plaintext which is really dangerous, considering how easy it is to set up a self signed cert then a HTTPS listener isn't really that harder to do. I would even consider finding a different WinRM client if possible as this should be something added from the get go.\r\n\r\nIf you really, really, really want to shoot yourself in the foot I believe you can set this policy through GPO which effectively means it's a registry key. Searching the registry for `AllowUnencrypted` might yield some extra info.",
