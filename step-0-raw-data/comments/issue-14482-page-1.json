    "body": "> Are they even symlinks?\r\n\r\nI have no idea what the issue is but a `.lnk` file is a shortcut file and not a symbolic link. This is why the `LinkType` is empty and it has no target. Technically a shortcut does have a target but PowerShell hasn't implemented support for getting the target. You would need to use COM to achieve that.\r\n\r\nThe simple way is\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$shell = New-Object -ComObject (\"WScript.Shell\")\r\n$shortcut = $shell.CreateShortcut('C:\\my\\shortcut.lnk')\r\n$shortcut.TargetPath\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this method does not support all shortcut targets. It will probably work in this case but there are times when `TargetPath` will be blank yet the shortcut does have a target path. To get the proper path you need some more complex C# code like what Ansible uses https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.windows/blob/main/plugins/modules/win_shortcut.ps1.\r\n\r\nYou could always just see the path by looking at the file properties in explorer though.",

It has something to do with the parsing of the console color properties within the terminal shortcut, and contained in the *metadata* property store data block. I managed to fix the broken shortcut, by editing the color definitions, resulting in about 4 different byte location changes. The byte [structure of a windows shortcut](https://github.com/libyal/liblnk/blob/main/documentation/Windows%20Shortcut%20File%20(LNK)%20format.asciidoc#6-extra-data) seem to be mostly unknown apart from that researched by some reverse engineering specialists. \r\n\r\nWhy editing the colors individually is breaking terminal ANSI character behavior, is still unknown. This is after all a powershell constructed `SymbolicLink`. \r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\n### The manual solution\r\n\r\n1. open the properties of the shortcut that is causing the problem\r\n2. open the properties of a shortcut that is **not** having the problem\r\n3. select the color tab and compare the color boxes **`[]`** of both. \r\n4. Then try to edit the colors of the broken shortcut. (You'll need to edit first the color codes for the box that is broken, then click on the color box that should be activated. These steps are shown in the pictures below. \r\n\r\n![pwsh_terminal_shortcut_issue1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52289379/102938751-971d9600-44b5-11eb-9f2f-ea8720b5de5b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n![pwsh_terminal_shortcut_issue_fix1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52289379/102938692-79e8c780-44b5-11eb-8b50-7169937a5a87.png)\r\n\r\n![pwsh_terminal_shortcut_issue_fix2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52289379/102938694-7b19f480-44b5-11eb-99c8-72894043310e.png)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe resulting binary diff can be shown to change 4 bytes at these locations of the shortcut. \r\n\r\n![pwsh_terminal_shortcut_issue_fix3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52289379/102937878-ca5f2580-44b3-11eb-82b4-8a1c6dff6b50.png)\r\n\r\nThese numbers turn out to coincide with the registry items as so:\r\n```bash\r\n# HKCU:\\Console\\<symlink_path>\r\n97      -->     17      - ScreenColors  : 23\r\n01      -->     00      - ColorTable01  : \"2nd color box from the left\"\r\n24 54   -->     00 ff   - ColorTable09  : \"10th color box from the left\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe console colors are probably part of this structure:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/libyal/liblnk/blob/main/documentation/Windows%20Shortcut%20File%20(LNK)%20format.asciidoc#621-console-color-flags\r\n\r\nThis bring up several questions. \r\n* Where exactly are these colors specified for default created windows *shortcuts* and *SymbolicLinks*?\r\n* How can we access and edit the console color fields when making links and shortcuts.\r\n* Is there a way to automatically fix all terminal shortcuts in one go?\r\n* Are there any registry items controlling these?\r\n* What are, and where are the official MS data structures for shortcuts and symbolic links?  \r\n(So we don't have to spend years and countless hours of hacking and reverse engineering to be able to figure out and solve these problems.)\r\n\r\n--- \r\n\r\nThis will hopefully resolve a large number of issues related to command line garbage.

    "body": "> Where exactly are these colors specified for default created windows shortcuts and SymbolicLinks?\r\n\r\nThe conhost settings are stored in a shortcut as you've seen. The format as you've seen is a binary file but it is definitely documented. You can see the structure of the conhost settings in a shortcut/.lnk at [MS-SHLINK 2.5.1 ConsoleDataBlock](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-shllink/e6b432b4-5a49-4826-9c25-e28695e8dd0c). When it comes to conhost settings there are 4 locations Windows uses:\r\n\r\n1. The defaults in conhost itself - you cannot touch these\r\n2. Your user account's specific settings in `HKCU:\\Console`\r\n3. A binary specific setting in `HKCU:\\Console\\<exe path>`\r\n4. Shortcut (.lnk) specific settings\r\n\r\nThe priority goes from lowest to highest, i.e conhost settings in a shortcut will trump anything else. When changing the settings the `Defaults` option sets option 2, and `Properties` sets option 4 if you opened it through a shortcut (.lnk) or 3 if it's just a normal path/symbolic link.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/102942101-28b1f580-4500-11eb-9a78-c869eab2fff3.png)\r\n\r\nSymbolic links have no special meaning here, they would just act like a different path so option 4 does not apply here. When testing that behaviour that's exactly what I see, any changes to the conhost properties are set under `HKCU:\\Console\\<symlink path>`.\r\n\r\n> How can we access and edit the console color fields when making links and shortcuts.\r\n\r\nThe official way is to open up the application using the shortcut and make the changes through the normal conhost properties. Any changes you make there will be set on the shortcut itself. There's probably third party tools out there that can do this for you and you could even create your own parser yourself if you really wanted to but dealing with binary data in PowerShell isn't the easiest thing to do.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned above symbolic links are treated the same as a normal path, that is any settings are stored in the registry (option 3) and not in the symbolic link itself.\r\n\r\n> Is there a way to automatically fix all terminal shortcuts in one go?\r\n\r\nYou can clear out any settings under `HKCU:\\Console\\` so it always uses your default profile's settings. You would still need to deal with shortcut files yourself in another way. Changing the binary data would be quite cumbersome to my recommendation would be to delete and recreate the shortcut yourself (or just not use them at all).\r\n\r\n> Are there any registry items controlling these?\r\n\r\nYes, as mentioned above `HKCU:\\Console` controls your user's default settings, and `HKCU:\\Console\\<path>` controls a path specific one.\r\n\r\n> What are, and where are the official MS data structures for shortcuts and symbolic links?\r\n\r\nShortcut files are documented under the [MS-SHLLINK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-shllink/e6b432b4-5a49-4826-9c25-e28695e8dd0c) protocol. They are a shell implementation and sit at a higher layer than where PowerShell sits. There's probably boundless documentation on this format ranging from basic end user setup details all the way to the format of the file.\r\n\r\nSymbolic links don't matter at all in this case. They are treated as just another path to the executable and based on the conhost settings they can have their own custom configuration if you so desire. In this case you should not treat symbolic links are any different from a normal path.\r\n\r\nNow going forward conhost is considered a legacy product. The replacement from Microsoft is Windows Terminal which has been massively improved from conhost and handles things like Unicode characters and colours whereas conhost is quite limited. When using Windows Terminal then these conhost settings do not apply at all as it has it's own configuration settings.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to learn more about conhost settings https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/understanding-windows-console-host-settings/ is a great guide which goes further in depth to what I've mentioned here.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2019/02/properties-520x600.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2019/03/cropped-CommandLineIcon-1-192x192.png\" height=\"14\"> Windows Command Line</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/understanding-windows-console-host-settings/\">Understanding Windows Console Host Settings | Windows Command Line</a></strong></div><div>Welcome to the first of several posts that describe some of the inner workings of the Windows Console.

    "body": "Speaking as the owner of both conhost and the Windows Terminal (both of which are [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal)), I'd like to clear up a few misconceptions.\r\n\r\n> conhost ... [legacy] ... [not supported]\r\n\r\nWe're avoiding the term \"legacy\" for the console host. It is an important and foundational part of Windows, and it is not becoming unsupported. It underpins all console applications, _even inside Windows Terminal._\r\n\r\nThe product here that is unsupported is Windows 8.1. It predates almost all of our conhost changes, from VT support to word wrap to all of the allocation and memory and performance improvements. _That_ version of Windows will not be receiving any further conhost _or Terminal_ updates¹.\r\n\r\n> Symbolic links don't matter at all in this case.\r\n\r\nThere is a bug in Windows that results in an application launched from a symbolic link being _told_ that it was launched from a shell link (!) whose path _is the symbolic link (!)_ ². This may confuse some applications. This [confuses conhost](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/7650) in a way that causes it to treat \"L\" or \"F\" as a hotkey (globally!) that will give the launched console window focus.\r\n\r\n> [some stuff about colors]\r\n\r\nWindows PowerShell made a [what should arguably be considered significant] mistake when it shipped and permanently redefined colors 5 and 6, as well as the default foreground/background colors, using its in-box lnk file. This is not normal, and should not be relied on. The color indices are fairly unyielding, and using the \"powershell default\" colors will cause you trouble literally everywhere else.\r\n\r\nOpen-source PowerShell fixed this. \r\n\r\n> ConsoleDataBlock ... undocumented\r\n\r\n[Here's the source](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/main/src/propslib/ShortcutSerialization.cpp) for the part of conhost that reads the shell link and pulls properties out of it. Our source is our documentation in many regards.\r\n\r\n> Escape character garbage ... [hex editing my shortcut file]\r\n\r\n> I doubt it would ever be fixed as it's a fundamental problem with how conhost deals with console output.\r\n\r\n**Nothing stored in the shortcut file will ever change the VT parsing behavior on Windows 8.1.** That functionality _does not exist_ in conhost.exe as of Windows 8.1. An application such as powershell emitting VT sequences to a console host that doesn't support it is an application bug.\r\n\r\n(@jborean93) This is not a \"fundamental problem,\" it is a feature that was implemented in the _seven years_ since Windows 8.1 shipped.\r\n\r\n> Where exactly are these colors specified for default created windows shortcuts and SymbolicLinks?\r\n\r\nDefault settings are all [here](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/683f4e28d3628a6a9a696fbd7cb6f23f036cb61f/src/host/settings.cpp#L99-L131). The campbell color table is [here](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/blob/683f4e28d3628a6a9a696fbd7cb6f23f036cb61f/src/types/colorTable.cpp#L11-L28).\r\n\r\nShell links by default have _no_ color information. If your shell link doesn't have a console block, settings are loaded in the order @jborean93 described.\r\n\r\n¹ Rumor has it that a build of conhost from our open-source repository (OpenConsole, \"Host.EXE\") _will run on Windows 8.1._ YMMV. NO WARRANTY, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. If it runs, it will support all modern console features from Windows 10.\r\n\r\n² This will result in the application opening an executable _as a lnk file_ and attempting to parse it. Not awesome.",
