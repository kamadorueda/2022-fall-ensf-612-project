    "body": "See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/15762. Using `foreach` like this (as part of a pipeline) is just an alias for `ForEach-Object` which isn't an actual loop in PowerShell. When you use `break/continue` it will continue to unwind the stack until it finds the language level loop which in this case is the whole stack causing it to act like return.\r\n\r\nWhile using `return` in a `ForEach-Object` block is similar to `continue` there's no real equivalent to `break` here. The closest is to have a check at the start and just return when it's true like so:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$break = $false\r\n1..5 | ForEach-Object -Process {\r\n    if ($break) { return }\r\n\r\n    if ($_ -eq 3) {\r\n        $break = $true\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    $_\r\n}\r\n```",
