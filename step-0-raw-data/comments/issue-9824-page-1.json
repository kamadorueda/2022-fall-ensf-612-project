How can the debugger no longer be needed when I'm in the debugger stepping through code?\r\n\r\nIf we want this logic needs to be kept, then the condition needs to change so that the debugger is not disabled the last breakpoint is removed and if you are currently in the debugger. I'm not sure what flag/setting tells me that, but there must be one. I'll have a look to see.",
