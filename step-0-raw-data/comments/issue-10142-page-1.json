Basically, in @lukepuplett's example, `n-argp` would expand to `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment`.  It specifically works against the upper case letters so doesn't fuzzy match additional characters.  What @lukepuplett is suggesting is a bit different and more of an expanded version of the abbreviation expansion",

My suggested behaviour was proposed simply because I'm used to Visual Studio's.\r\n\r\nI must point out that the problems for me - and I'm assuming other people, too - are\r\n\r\n1. Typing long commands.\r\n1. Remembering the name of all the commands.\r\n\r\nBeing able to enter some of the tokens I do remember and tab-cycling them would help.\r\n\r\nMatching on the initials would solve 1 but doesn't sound like it would help at all with 2.",
