My initial (very unoptimized) PR is [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/17680), you can go to my PR, click \"start codespaces\" if you're in the beta or open the branch in a devcontainer on vscode, and after initial setup you should just be able to hit ctrl-shift-b (`Run Default Build Task`) and get a working build with no other setup required.\r\n\r\n\r\nWould you consider that a satisfaction of your issue?

They started supporting that later and I contributed the first working version for both VS-Code and VS) in #10114\r\nI kept updating them initially but their shape has changed into a not so desirable direction for external contributors quite a bit since. I don't know why but the base image was changed from `dotnet/sdk` to `powershell/test-deps` for example. I'd agree as well that we should bring back a working version of it for external contributors that just want quick building/testing.",
