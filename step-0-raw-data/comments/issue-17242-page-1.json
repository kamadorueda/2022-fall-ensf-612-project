    "body": "@griesi007  How would you implement execution policy on Linux ? \r\n\r\nBecause it is possible to have multiple side by side installs for PowerShell core it is also possible that a setup demands signed for the default (on-the-path) version and has something different for testing older / pre-release versions. So a file in the the same directory as the executable is a simple way of getting that. \r\n\r\n64 bit and 32 bit Windows PowerShell put these setting in different parts of the registry so execution policy needs to be changed twice to cover both. So there is a precedent for saying two side by side versions do not interfere with each other. \r\n\r\nYou're right that there is an argument that on Windows the settings should go under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\6` or  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\7` but there is an equal and opposite argument different platforms should avoid special behaviours.  That is the argument which minimizes the amount of work for implementation and testing :-)  If the policies work correctly the storage mechanism isn't important. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

As the msi package is platform agnostic this could easily be configured there. Also I understand your argument for other use cases. But shouldn´t this be an optional configuration option? Can PowerShell 7 currently be configured to write into the registry similar as PowerShell 5 does? At least the documentation of PowerShell 7 should mention this different behaviour clearly. I assume most people are not aware of the fact that PowerShell 7 does not write to the registry, so all cmdlets which modify the registry in PowerShell 5 are pretty useless if one uses PowerShell 7 as a replacement for 5.",

    "body": "> @jhoneill\r\n> \r\n> 1. I am modifying a policy to have any effect. Storing it in JSON files does not have any effect. So this is pretty useless\r\n\r\n**PowerShell 7 reads the JSON and Group Policy Settings**. As you have shown:\r\n\r\n-  When you run Set-ExecutionPolicy in 64 bit PowerShell 5 it sets the policy for 64 bit PowerShell 5, but not for 32 bit PowerShell 5 or Powershell 6 and later.  \r\n- When you run Set-ExecutionPolicy in 32 bit PowerShell 5 it sets the policy for 32 bit PowerShell 5, but not for 64 bit PowerShell 5 or Powershell 6 and later.  \r\n- When you run Set-ExecutionPolicy in PowerShell 6 or 7 it sets the policy for that installation of PowerShell 6/7 (there may be more than one). \r\n\r\nAt no time has Set-ExecutionPolicy been a global setting for all different versions of PowerShell. \r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 5 normal users have read-only access to the Registry key holding the machine setting.    \r\nIn PowerShell 6/7 Normal users have read-only access to the JSON file holding the machine setting. \r\n\r\nAs the image below shows running Set-Execution policy changes the json. Changing the JSON causes an issue with an untrusted file in PSReadline, and won't load my unsigned profile. **Clearly the policy IS effective.**  \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/166689845-6b387e58-03ab-406d-a1cd-fa4e30f40c23.png)\r\n\r\nHere's a second screen shot showing that if you edit the JSON the policy changes - and this is PowerShell 6 \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/166692508-3acfe148-991d-499f-a824-2a4fd431920a.png)\r\n\r\nNote that this is not supported. The text in the JSON might change, the location of the file might change. In version 8 it could be YAML or XML format, or back in the registry.  The only supported way to read or write the policy is with cmdlet for that version of PowerShell. \r\n\r\n> 2. That´s not true. All official MS Documentation refers to the powershell for configuring the ExecutionPolicy, which implies that this modifies the appropriate registry settings and that this is supported. Otherwise it would not have any effect\r\n\r\nAll official documentation  that I am aware of **refers to the `set-ExcutionPolicy` cmdlet.** Which sets the policy (via json) for 6/7 and via registry for 5 and earlier. I'm pretty sure there is no official advice to use `reg.exe  <something>` to set set a policy by merging in a .REG file, nor to run `regedit` and navigate to `HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShell\\ExecutionPolicy`,     \r\nnor to use `Get-ItemProperty hklm:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShell -name ExecutionPolicy`  \r\nbut if you know different please share. \r\n\r\nThere **is** an error in the on-line help which still says the policy is stored in the registry, but does not give a path or recommend accessing the registry directly. \r\n\r\n> 3. Could you please advise what needs to be configured so PowerShell 7 ExecutionPolicy cmdlet modifies the appropriate registry settings\r\n\r\n**PowerShell 7 doesn't get its execution policy from the registry but from a JSON file.**  there is no \"appropriate registry setting\" for execution policy in PS 7.   If the cmdlet changed a registry setting pwsh.exe would still look at the JSON not the registry.  You can hack the registry for the PowerShell 5 policy setting from PowerShell 7 (e.g. with` Set-ItemProperty`)  I don't know how many different ways I can put that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
