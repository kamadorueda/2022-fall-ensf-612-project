Parallelizing running scriptblocks involves creating runspaces and executing script on separate threads, subject to a throttle limit (default is 5 simultaneous threads).  Doing this to simply access an object property is a tremendous waste of resources and takes up a lot of time as you discovered.  ForEach -Parallel only makes sense when running scriptblocks performs long computations or long waits for results from asynchronous operations, where the resource overhead is used effectively.\r\n\r\nAlso writing to the console, as your example does, re-serializes each parallel operation, negating any positive effects.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> (measure-command { dir -dir | % -parallel { $results = dir -r $_.FullName 2>$null } }).Seconds\r\n16\r\n\r\nPS C:\\> (measure-command { dir -dir | % { $results = dir -r $_.FullName 2>$null } }).Seconds\r\n25\r\n```",

    "body": "@KurtDeGreeff Indeed [we discussed this in the RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/174#discussion_r284863147). There was discussion that the parallel syntax should indicate that it's faster than a `foreach () { }` loop but making such a claim is an oversimplification.\r\n\r\nParallelisation is not automagically faster; there is considerable overhead involved. This is true not just in PowerShell, but in .NET and everywhere else.\r\n\r\nYou need to be judicious in the application of a performance tune like parallelisation. Is the time taken to run each task considerably longer than the overhead of job management? Is the operation you're running parallelisable or will it degenerate to some kind of serial execution (with the added overhead of thread contention and job management)? Is the operation *safe* to parallelise? Is the platform/hardware you're running on going to give you some benefit from running things in parallel (e.g. not on a single-core VM)?\r\n\r\nThe addition of the `-Parallel` switch is a powerful tool, but needs to be used wisely. It's easy to test whether you will get a performance benefit from it though; if the operation inside the `ForEach-Object` is likely to be long running, do some comparative performance tests with `Measure-Command` and pick the faster invocation.",

    "body": "I should also have mentioned that parallelizing high computation tasks only makes sense when multiple cores are available.  If you have only one core (like a single core VM) then all threads have to run be scheduled sequentially anyway, and parallelism provides no benefit unless each parallel task is waiting for a result (say from a remote call).\r\n\r\nI'll work on creating a blog that I hope will help make clear when using foreach -parallel is beneficial.",
