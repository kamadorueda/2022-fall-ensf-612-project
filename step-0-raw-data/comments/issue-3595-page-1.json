As for `Get-Service` cmdlet I add the alias in `InitialSessionState.cs` and remove from .psd1 files. After that I start PowerShell, ipmo .\\Build.psm1 and get error \"AllScope option cannot be removed from the alias 'gin'\". CI tests is failed too as you see. Then I remove `[Alias(\"gin\")]` from `GetComputerInfoCommand.cs` - now all work well.\r\n\r\n1. So my question is what is right way? Move aliases to `InitialSessionState.cs` or add Alias attribute to cmdlets and exclude them on unsupported platform? Or Alias attribute is for third-party cmdlets only and we should remove it from `Get-ComputerInfo`?\r\n\r\n2. How `Get-ComputerInfo` is excluded from compiling code on Unix?\r\n\r\n3. Why we only init exported aliases in `InitialSessionState.cs` but not cmdlets?",

    "body": "> So my question is what is right way?\r\n\r\nWhat I would do is:\r\n1. For cmdlets that are not supposed to work on Unix, like `Get-ComputerInfo`, exclude the source code from unix build, by enclosing the code with in `#if !UNIX` and `#endif`. Please take `TimeZoneCommands.cs` as an example.\r\n2. For aliases that declared in `InitialSessionState.cs`, move the declarations to the `#if !UNIX/endif` section. You will find the section in the part of code that declares all `SessionStateAliasEntry` instances.\r\n\r\nFor cmdlets like `*-Clipboard`, they have already been excluded from the build in powershell core. You can take a look at the .csproj file of the corresponding project.\r\n\r\nBasically, there are also 4 aliases that are currently exposed on unix plats by mistake.

Both options work equally. So it looks safe if we move the cmdlet aliases in cmdlets and exclude the files (or the aliases) with #if !UNIX  and  #endif if we need. The only public change will be (not breaking change) that we will remove aliases that should not be there (aliases for not ported cmdlets or aliases unwanted on Unix) and add the ones we want to appear. So users get right thinks with ` [initialsessionstate]::CreateDefault()`.",

I don't see any patterns in that - why not all aliases readonly? Ex.: `Connect-PSSession` - read only but `New-PSSession` - no?\r\nI could agree that some core aliases should be read only but not all.\r\n\r\n2.

    "body": "@iSazonov sorry for coming back so late.\r\nThe scope options, yes, thanks for bringing it up --\r\n- `AllScope` indicates the alias is copied to any new scopes that are created\r\n- `ReadOnly` indicates the alias cannot be changed\r\n\r\n> I don't see any patterns in that - why not all aliases readonly? Ex.: Connect-PSSession - read only but New-PSSession - no?\r\nI could agree that some core aliases should be read only but not all.\r\n\r\nI agree the alias option settings there seem a bit messed up, for example, aliases for `*-PSSession` cmdlets should be consistent in my opinion.\r\nHowever, some of the aliases are made `AllScope` only for a good reason -- so that user can make them point to customized function/utility as they want. An example [here](https://serverfault.com/questions/452430/how-to-override-the-default-dir-alias-in-powershell) that override the `dir` alias.\r\n\r\n> Also from [Alias()] an attribute is added with ScopedItemOptions.None. Why no 'ScopedItemOptions.AllScope'? Why no ScopedItemOptions.ReadOnly?\r\n\r\nYep, `AliasAttribute` now doesn't set any options to an alias, which seems by design to me, because we don't want the module author to decide if their alias definition should be copied to all scopes or can never be changed by the user. For a module cmdlet, a user should be the one to make that decision. PowerShell defines some alias as 'AllScope' or 'ReadOnly' because they are core cmdlets and probably shouldn't be randomly altered by the user.\r\n\r\n> There is exclusion for sls and Select-String - where did it come from?\r\n\r\nThis can be explained by the same `dir` example I gave above. It sounds like very common for people to set `sls` to point to a different function/utility. With `AllScope`, you have to write `Set-Alias ... -Option AllScope` to make it work, which is annoying. I think that's why it was made `None` option.\r\n\r\nIt turns out there are good reasons to keep alias declarations in InitialSessionState.cs. I suggest we go back to the proposal I made in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3595#issuecomment-295951577\r\n\r\n",
