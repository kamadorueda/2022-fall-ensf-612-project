    "body": "I... appreciate the reasoning, but I'd be _super_ wary of trying to add data to a primitive like that. Most primitives don't go so well with things like that. We already have a few issues around primitives with noteproperties thanks to Add-Member selectively supporting it.\r\n\r\nIt's also starkly different to what currently is provided as output from any other cmdlet whatsoever and would set a very odd precedence and preference to decorate output data rather than changing it at all, which (in my opinion) is liable to discourage changes to any existing cmdlet's output, period, regardless of how much utility it may provide.\r\n\r\nFinally, as @iSazonov mentioned, the `Test-Connection` cmdlet was that was shipped in 6.x.x was always going to be subject to change, and should still be considered such. Yes, improvements have been made -- awesome! As Ilya noted, though, we're still effectively at the whim of the .NET Core team here on this one and the network APIs they're providing. Until those APIs are more complete, I don't think we should be assuming this cmdlet will always behave as is.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, I think trying to cram all that data onto a _primitive_ as the output type is a bad idea. Now, perhaps the _default_ behaviour should still be to return a primitive to maintain compatibility for now (I'd recommend at **least** an experimental feature to opt-in to entirely new output here though) but when explicitly asking for additional results, it should switch to a different output type.\r\n\r\nAdding additional data **to a primitive** _in some cases_ is almost certainly guaranteed to end up being a huge pitfall in some case or another, and we really don't need to be confusing users here. üôÇ ",

    "body": "Last I checked, PS7 isn't _technically_ released yet. üòâ \r\n\r\nI did a cursory search, but the only issues I can find at the moment are these two:\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11169\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11171\r\n\r\nI know I've seen others... but I'm probably not searching quite the right terms to get them at the moment. I'll have to think on it some more.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts are... thus:\r\n\r\n1. The current state of the cmdlet has always been in flux ever since the work to port it in 6.x. If this was ever planned to change... I don't think that was ever communicated.\r\n2. The APIs backing this cmdlet up are, not to put too fine a point on it, completely unfinished. Giving users the expectation that the cmdlet will be stable and usable on all platforms even most of the time is unrealistic, and we'll just end up with a slew of issues raised that we literally won't be able to solve unless we want to write .NET's networking APIs from scratch in a hotfix at some point and patch it in.\r\n3. _If_ the choice here is to leave the less usable behaviour here, I would probably advise we not go the route of adding noteproperties to Boolean values. Every complex type in PS current casts to `$true` if you do something like `if ($output) { ... }` -- these would be the only exception. It breaks the long-held assumption by many that if there's data in it, it's truthy. And the way we're framing this suggestion seems to indicate that there won't be a whole lot of indicators to clue users in until a script doesn't work as intended.\r\n    - Note also that it is by design impossible to change how any comparison / cast treats Boolean values directly. It's built into the engine as a number of explicit exceptions so that no amount of PSTypeConverters or meticulously-written Equals() overloads can change how casts and comparisons to Boolean behave, so users can't interact with this kind of output other than by checking PSTypeNames and property values directly.\r\n\r\nIf we _must_ keep the boolean output here, I think we're all far better off tucking these features away behind an experimental feature flag completely, so that users who _do_ want it can go ahead and use it, without having to worry about nonsensical behaviour when using the data much like any other cmdlets' output.\r\n\r\n(also, semi-related: it might be a better option at some point to move most / all of this cmdlet's functionality into one with a more appropriate verb name; `Get-ConnectionInfo` might be a decent-ish idea. Then we can confine the true/false output to this cmdlet, where it belongs with the `Test` verb.)",

PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detetcted.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiamFja2RjYXNleSIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xMTQ1MiIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic1VwIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiamFja2RjYXNleSIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xMTQ1MiIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6Ik5ldXRyYWwifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiamFja2RjYXNleSIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xMTQ1MiIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic0Rvd24ifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",
