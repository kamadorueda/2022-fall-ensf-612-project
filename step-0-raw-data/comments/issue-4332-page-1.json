Unless you're going to make interfaces public so that sort of host interception logging would be possible _in every host_ without using private methods, I don't need a cmdlet version of redirection, and I don't want weird new syntax for capturing without redirecting (that is, passthrough capturing)\r\n\r\nP.S.

    "body": "@Jaykul \r\n\r\nAgreed re `Tee-Object` cmdlet.\r\n\r\n> Unless you're going to make interfaces public so that sort of host interception logging\r\n\r\nI don't think we should think of this in terms of _hosts_ - the fact that external-program output is sent directly to the host by default should be considered an implementation detail. Instead, we want to be able to target _streams_:\r\n\r\nThe `>` operator already allows you to selectively redirect stderr output (which would by default go to the host, and with the proposal at hand we would now also support variables as targets (potentially among others).\r\n\r\nThe suggestion to enable optional _pass-through_ functionality stems from a gap in functionality with respect to external programs and their stderr output, specifically.\r\n\r\nFor _PowerShell_ commands you can use the `-*Variable` common parameters (e.g., `-ErrorVariable`), optionally via an aux. `Invoke-Command` call, to capture stream output _with pass-through logic_; that is, capturing stream output this way passes through _by default_, and you need to explicitly silence the target stream to suppress that.\r\n\r\nThis ability is currently lacking for _external-program calls_ - you only have the choice between passing through to the host only, or redirecting and thereby _invariably_ silencing the stream.\r\n\r\nIt is conceivable that you want to _both_ see stderr output - and doing so _in context_, interleaved with stdout output is especially important when calling external programs - _and_ capture it.\r\n\r\nYou can actually _somewhat_ emulate this with `Invoke-Command` at the moment though it's both highly obscure and has major side effects, notably polluting the success output stream and changing the output sequencing:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# $e captures stderr output, while still passing it through - albeit invariably\r\n# via the *success* output stream, and out of sequence\r\nInvoke-Command { ls / nosuch 2>&1 } -ErrorVariable e\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, if `-ErrorVariable` were able to capture stderr output _as-is_, then we arguably do _not_ need a new syntax (I cannot speak to the technical feasibility):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING:\r\n# Pass stderr output through, in output order, *and* capture it in variable $e\r\n# (Currently, this records nothing in $e.)\r\nInvoke-Command { ls / nosuch } -ErrorVariable e\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> P.S. Alias: is a content drive and works just as well as ENV: for holding strings..\r\n\r\nIndeed; to spell it out: the proposal is to allow targeting drives of all those PS providers that implement the `IContentCmdletProvider` interface, which _technically_ means the following standard providers:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> (Get-PSProvider | Where-Object { \r\n      $_.ImplementingType.GetInterfaces() -contains [System.Management.Automation.Provider.IContentCmdletProvider] \r\n    }).Name\r\n\r\nAlias\r\nEnvironment\r\nFileSystem\r\nFunction\r\nVariable\r\n",
