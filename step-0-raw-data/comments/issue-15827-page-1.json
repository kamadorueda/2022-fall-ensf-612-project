I run following code https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/hosting/creating-remote-runspaces?view=powershell-7.1 that is run in continuous loop with rate 1 command per sec. After 1.5hour of working memory get leaked to 2 gigabytes level. I took memory dump and managed memory heap + loaded dlls (analyzed thru using sos) is fine up to 50 megabyte so I believe, that  leak is appearing in unmanaged code. \r\n\r\nCan some one look on this issue ?\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63739355/130230628-361d2fc7-ce0b-4552-8c78-b623d4b155e4.png)\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo-powershell-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/hosting/creating-remote-runspaces\">Creating remote runspaces - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>Creating remote runspaces</div></blockquote>",
