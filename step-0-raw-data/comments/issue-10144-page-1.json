What other projects are you referring to? At the end of the day, these were examples (not exhaustive list) of things folks need to be thinking of when they make changes.\r\n\r\n> I believe that these projects should themselves track changes in the engine at the preview stage and write feedback.\r\n\r\nThis _sounds_ good, in a world where resources are steady for these projects. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. In a lot of these projects, resources (aka people) flow in and out and changes in PowerShell that need to also be applied to tooling can be easily missed (see examples in PR description).\r\n\r\nThat’s what this PR is for. To bring tooling into the light to enumerate concerns that could exist in these other projects owned by the PowerShell team and at least start the discussion/awareness in the event that active parties are not watching.\r\n\r\nThere’s no expectation at this time that tooling needs to be updated _with the PR to PowerShell_ but down the road, *PowerShell team members* may move to a model like this where you own a feature end to end:\r\n\r\n* PR in PowerShell\r\n* PR in PowerShell docs\r\n* PR in needed tooling\r\n\r\nThis is because pretty much all tooling is now under @SteveL-MSFT - vscode extension, PSSA, even PowerShellGet now. (I didn’t think PowerShellGet was worth mentioning here as it’s mostly API calls, and will be more abstracted out if/when PSGet 3 comes around).\r\n",
