    "body": "TLDR:\r\n* Mixing and matching objects, strings, and write-host with transcription is _really_ tricky.\r\n \r\nI’m not sure this is a bug, per se, but a subtle interaction between the script and how transcription works with our pipelines. I will agree that it is in no way intuitive.\r\n \r\nOne of the things that happen when you emit objects is that the formatting of those objects gets handled by out-default, but after the script has completed and since transcription has stopped, that output doesn’t get transcribed. Strings are handled differently, they’re sometimes short-circuited through formatting (but sometimes not). The combination of write-host (which makes an immediate write), write-object <string> (which may get short-circuited through formatting), and output of a <complexObject> makes this pretty hard to reason about what’s going to happen. However, there may be a way that you may want to try (See “A POSSIBLE WAY” below).\r\n \r\nEven more details:\r\n \r\nHere are a couple of variations on the theme:\r\n \r\nVariation 1 – your scenario, with the output of a structured object at the end of all of the other operations.\r\n\r\n```powershell \r\nPS> cat s2.ps1\r\nremove-item s2 -ea ignore\r\nstart-transcript s2 -usemin\r\nwrite-host \"1\"\r\nwrite-output \"2\"\r\nget-location\r\nwrite-host \"4\"\r\nwrite-output \"5\"\r\nstop-transcript\r\n \r\nPS> ./s2.ps1\r\nTranscript started, output file is s2\r\n1\r\n2\r\n \r\n4\r\nPath\r\n----\r\n/Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript\r\n5\r\nTranscript stopped, output file is /Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript/s2\r\n ```\r\n \r\nThis one is really confusing, but explainable (but perhaps not satisfying). ‘Write-Host 4’ is visible before `get-location` because Write-Host is hot-rodded directly into the host and emitted (there’s code in transcription which essentially tees the output to the transcript file and the console). Then we have the regular output of `get-location` and `write-output 5` sent as output of the script.\r\n\r\nSince transcription is turned off before the script exits, it’s not rendered in the transcript, because the objects were sent to the next consumer in the pipeline (in this case, it’s out-default which is what the engine does automatically). The tricky bit is that strings are also somewhat hot-rodded in our formatting, so the first `write-output 2` gets emitted and captured by the transcript, but the insertion of the `get-location` object causes it to be pushed into the stack of things that need actual formatting, which sets a bit of state for any remaining objects which may need formatting (which is why the second `write-output 5` doesn’t get transcripted.\r\n \r\n ```powershell\r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript start\r\nStart time: 20191106114858\r\n**********************\r\nTranscript started, output file is s2\r\n1\r\n2\r\n \r\n4\r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript end\r\nEnd time: 20191106114858\r\n**********************\r\n ```\r\n\r\nVariation 2 – move the object emission to the beginning\r\n\r\n```powershell \r\nstart-transcript s3 -usemin\r\nget-location\r\nwrite-host \"1\"\r\nwrite-output \"2\"\r\nwrite-host \"4\"\r\nwrite-output \"5\"\r\nstop-transcript\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that the `write-host` happen before anything, and then the objects start to come out. The string output essentially forces the object to be rendered to the screen, but you’ll notice that the transcript contains only the output of Write-Host. That’s because those were piped to the formatting after the script turned off transcription.\r\n \r\n```powershell \r\nPS> ./s3.ps1\r\nTranscript started, output file is s3\r\n \r\n1\r\n4\r\nPath\r\n----\r\n/Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript\r\n2\r\n5\r\nTranscript stopped, output file is /Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript/s3\r\n \r\n  \r\nPS> cat s3\r\n \r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript start\r\nStart time: 20191106115142\r\n**********************\r\nTranscript started, output file is s3\r\n \r\n1\r\n4\r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript end\r\nEnd time: 20191106115142\r\n**********************\r\n```\r\n\r\nVariation 3 – object emission at the end:\r\nWe can see that everything but the object is now in the transcript\r\n \r\n```powershell\r\nPS> cat s4.ps1\r\nstart-transcript s4 -usemin\r\nwrite-host \"1\"\r\nwrite-output \"2\"\r\nwrite-host \"4\"\r\nwrite-output \"5\"\r\nget-location\r\nstop-transcript\r\n```\r\n \r\nHere’s the execution flow\r\n\r\n```powershell \r\nPS> ./s4.ps1\r\nTranscript started, output file is s4\r\n1\r\n2\r\n4\r\n5\r\n \r\nPath\r\n----\r\n/Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript\r\nTranscript stopped, output file is /Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript/s4\r\n```\r\n \r\nAnd the content of the transcript\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript start\r\nStart time: 20191106115255\r\n**********************\r\nTranscript started, output file is s4\r\n1\r\n2\r\n4\r\n5\r\n \r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript end\r\nEnd time: 20191106115255\r\n**********************\r\n```\r\n \r\n## A Possible Way\r\n\r\nLastly, here’s a slight variation on the original, but now everything will be in the transcript. I’ve taken the code of interest and am calling the formatter forcefully via out-default. You’ll notice that the last Write-Host call is still out of order, that’s because of the short-circuiting of write-host which is a direct call into the host and does not go into the output stream.\r\n\r\n```powershell \r\nstart-transcript s5 -usemin\r\n.{\r\n    write-host \"1\"\r\n    write-output \"2\"\r\n    get-location\r\n    write-host \"4\"\r\n    write-output \"5\"\r\n} | out-default\r\nstop-transcript\r\n```\r\n \r\nHere’s the execution, followed by the transcript\r\n \r\n```powershell\r\nPS> ./s5.ps1\r\nTranscript started, output file is s5\r\n1\r\n2\r\n \r\n4\r\nPath\r\n----\r\n/Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript\r\n5\r\n \r\nTranscript stopped, output file is /Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript/s5\r\n  \r\n \r\nPS> cat s5\r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript start\r\nStart time: 20191106115701\r\n**********************\r\nTranscript started, output file is s5\r\n1\r\n2\r\n \r\n4\r\nPath\r\n----\r\n/Users/jimtru/src/projects/transcript\r\n5\r\n \r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript end\r\nEnd time: 20191106115701\r\n**********************\r\n```",

    "body": "I hope people understand that if this was easy to fix, we would have done it.  The transcription code is more than 10 years old and its design has limitations not easily addressed.  The robocopy example above is an example where the NativeCommandProcessor has an optimization where if a native command is at the end of the pipeline, then it doesn't read the stdout pipe and instead just has the exe send the output directly to the console.  In this case, transcription is not aware (since PowerShell is not aware) of any output.  Piping to a cmdlet works around this optimization.\r\n\r\nIt would actually be easier to create a `script`-like executable (perhaps called `transcript.exe` that does what `script` does which is start a new instance of the shell that ran it and read stdout/stderr/stdin and write that to a file while also passing it through to the shell.  Doing it within the shell is problematic due to output being \"leaky\".\r\n\r\n",
