Yes, it sucks, because it feels like every desired state configuration tool (Chef, Puppet, SaltStack) has some ugly usability issues tied to the programming environment (e.g., for years Chef used a version of Ruby that did not ship with any easy way to output logs to standard out...).  As much has been said about DevOps, little gets done, especially on Windows, which is why Hashicorp TerraForm became so popular, because it actually works, unlike stuff Microsoft started and then abandoned.",
