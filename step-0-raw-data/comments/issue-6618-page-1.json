    "body": "@markekraus I like the suggestion in the RFC you mentioned, but in my opinion what you are suggesting there is something like a download utility similar to `wget` or a download manager (e.g. something like CloudBerry, Cyberduck or others).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion the WebCmdlets are about handling Web Requests and their responses. The response to a POST, PUT, GET or DELETE request can contain content and the `Content-Disposition` header is adding information about the content such as a filename which should be used to save the content. A download utility, as you suggested in the RFC, should be targeted at downloading files (e.g. via a HTTP GET request) and not handling responses of POST, PUT, GET or DELETE requests, which may contain files in their responses.\r\n\r\n[As the WebCmdlets already include functionality to save the content to a file via the `-OutFile` parameter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-webrequest?view=powershell-6), I don't think we are overloading any functionality here.\r\n\r\nI noted that `-OutFile` accepts String as input, and only the documentation states that the parameter should either be path plus filename or only filename (and then `$PWD` will be used as path).\r\n\r\nTherefore my suggestion is, to extend the current behaviour and documentation:\r\n\r\n- Allow the `-OutFile` parameter to contain either a path OR a path and a filename OR only a filename\r\n- In case the string specified is a directory, the filename will be extracted from the `Content-Disposition` header if available. If not available, the filename will be the last part of the URL without query parameters (e.g. for https://example.org/path/to/file.txt it would be `file.txt`)\r\n\r\nThis would bring the WebCmdlets closer to the `curl` behavior and would meet what several users are expecting from the WebCmdlets when using the `-OutFile` parameter (see discussions [on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25125818/powershell-invoke-webrequest-how-to-automatically-use-original-file-name), [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/30d8uu/downloading_a_file_from_a_redirected_link_using/).\r\n\r\nThis is an example how curl handles the filename of the `Content-Disposition` header (parameter `-O` is required to save to file and `-J` to use extract the filename from the `Content-Disposition` header instead from the URL:\r\n\r\n        curl http://test.greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/attwithasciifilename35.asis -O -J -v\r\n      % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current\r\n                                     Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed\r\n      0     0    0     0    0     0      0      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--     0*   Trying 217.91.35.233...\r\n    * TCP_NODELAY set\r\n    * Connected to test.greenbytes.de (217.91.35.233) port 80 (#0)\r\n    > GET /tech/tc2231/attwithasciifilename35.asis HTTP/1.1\r\n    > Host: test.greenbytes.de\r\n    > User-Agent: curl/7.54.0\r\n    > Accept: */*\r\n    > \r\n    < HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n    < Date: Thu, 12 Apr 2018 21:31:00 GMT\r\n    < Server: Apache/2.4.33 (Ubuntu)\r\n    < Cache-Control: no-cache\r\n    < Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"00000000001111111111222222222233333\"\r\n    < Upgrade: h2\r\n    < Connection: Upgrade\r\n    < Cache-Control: max-age=3600\r\n    < Expires: Thu, 12 Apr 2018 22:31:00 GMT\r\n    < Vary: Accept-Encoding\r\n    < Content-Length: 527\r\n    < Content-Type: text/html; charset=\"ISO-8859-1\"\r\n    < \r\n    { [527 bytes data]\r\n    100   527  100   527    0     0  10075      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:-- 10134\r\n    * Connection #0 to host test.greenbytes.de left intact\r\n    curl: Saved to filename '00000000001111111111222222222233333'\r\n\r\n[This page has several examples for testing the `Content-Disposition` header](http://test.greenbytes.de/tech/tc2231/).",

    "body": "@markekraus I don't understand why you insist that handling attachments is something which needs to be done in a different Cmdlet. This issue is not about downloading a file. It is about extracting the filename for the response content from the `Content-Disposition` header, which is considerably different. A user may need to issue a complex Web Request with HTTP Header, Body and a Method different than GET (most often POST, but also PUT or DELETE) and where the response happens to contain an attachment which should be saved locally. As `-OutFile` already exists as a parameter, this issue is only about allowing to use the filename provided in the response instead of specifying it upfront. **This issue is not about adding download functionality to WebCmdlets**.\r\n\r\nThe Cmdlet you proposed in the RFC is about downloading (e.g. retrieving) a file. I agree, that functionality specific to downloading files could (and probably should) be handled in a different Cmdlet and that also includes extracting the filename from the `Content-Disposition` header. There are some features which would really bloat the existing WebCmdlets like multipart downloads (e.g. via multiple parallel HTTP Range Requests), Async IO for saving files, resumable downloads, protocols other than HTTP and probably several more features. Saving an attachment in resposne to a complex Web Request is not something which requires a different Cmdlet in my opinion, as it would bloat the Download Cmdlet and require it to allow specifying HTTP Header, Body and different HTTP Methods which are what the existing WebCmdlets seem to be designed for. The Download Cmdlet could reuse the existing WebCmdlets and enhance them with additional features for downloading files.\r\n\r\nThere is a good reason, that both `wget` and `curl` exist and are both used in different uses cases. `wget` handles downloading of files, similar to what you suggest. `curl` handles Web Requests and their responses.\r\n\r\nI'd be glad if others would add their view here. It may also be a good idea to exactly specify what the community (and the [PowerShell Committee](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/community/governance.md#powershell-committee)) want to achieve with the existing WebCmdlets and what they do not want to achieve with them, maybe even through dedicated RFCs for the WebCmdlets.",

    "body": ">  I don't understand why you insist that handling attachments is something which needs to be done in a different Cmdlet.\r\n\r\nI know I sound like a broken record, but: All of the value of the web cmdlets derives from their ability process web content. That is to say, doing meaningful things with HTML, XML, JSON, and plain-text. Their code is geared towards it. Adding features to support downloads or \"attachments\" or any other way you want to paint them is a completely different functionality. That is why. \r\n\r\nYou can already rename the file after the fact by inspecting the content disposition header on the response. So this lack of convenience is non-blocking. But, adding this feature is a non-trivial amount of work that requires limiting the cmdlets' flexibility to extend and improve features relevant to their core functionality.\r\n\r\nIf you think you may need POST functionality in order to retrieve remote files, please comment on the RFC.",
