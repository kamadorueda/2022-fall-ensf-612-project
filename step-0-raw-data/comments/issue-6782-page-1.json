I do know that It takes me a few seconds to figure out that the code you provided is just wrapping a string in quotes.\r\n\r\nThis is not obviously for code reviewer. My first impression was that it evidently. Then there were questions. Why we use formatting if we need quoting? Why we use `InvariantCulture` in `ConvertTo` and `CurrentCulture` in `$\"\"`? What's the trick? Should we worry about allocations? - we just had a discussion that PowerShell sometimes consumes too much resources and we should be more thrifty. As a result, we received a good exchange of views. It was useful for me to know your point of view.\r\n\r\nSumming up this discussion I think `String.Concat()` will be the best pattern here.\r\n",
