This is relatively small, so we don't feel like kicking it out to the RFC process, but we'd all feel a lot more comfortable if it had some bake time for feedback. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, it would be great if folks have written a lot of argument completers to provide their feedback. Off the top of my head, @lzybkr knows a ton here (not least of which because of PSReadline), and I know both @dahlbyk and @LeoColomb work on posh-git. Probably @rkeithhill has some experience in this space as well? It'd be great to hear from you all to make sure  we get the details right here. ",

I mentioned it earlier, but `--` handling is just one of a handful of complicating factors for posh-git:\r\n\r\n- Nearly all (but not all - shout out to `git filter-branch`) commands treat anything after ` -- ` as a file path\r\n- Git aliases need to be parsed to determined which command we're actually doing expansion for\r\n- Expanding a remote name (e.g. `origin`) might be just the origin name, or it might be part of a branch reference (e.g. `origin/master`) depending on context\r\n- When completing file paths, we sometimes give preference to paths relevant to the command (e.g. `git add <tab>` expands paths that have been modified)\r\n- I'm not sure how PowerShell completers handle command arguments aliases (`--patch` / `-p`)",
