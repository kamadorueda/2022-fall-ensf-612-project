    "body": "Depends on quite a bit, I'm afraid. PS boxes value types implicitly in pretty much every operation, so trying to address things by reference like you're doing here when they're a value type aren't guaranteed to work. C# is able to get a pointer to the struct in-memory, so it's able to modify it. PowerShell, though, loses that reference by boxing the value type (since to box it, it has to copy it and now has a different reference, since it can't box the reference itself).\r\n\r\nSo by the time you get to setting a value, the struct you set the value on is actually not the same one as in the array.\r\n\r\nShould it work? I guess so, probably, depends on what your goal is really. For a quick workaround, I think you can do a simple cast to `[object[]]` after creating the array and modify the structs within that array instead, since they're already boxed and the reference will remain intact through indexing operations.\r\n\r\nCan it be made to work without breaking a significant portion of PS's functionality is a completely different question, though.\r\n\r\nThis is a few shades out of my usual depth, but that's my present understanding of the problem, as it were. ðŸ™‚ ",

    "body": "Not sure if the rest of this post should be it's own issue, or if it even belongs in this repo since it isn't really actionable, but I'mma put it here.\r\n\r\nSo I've mentioned that a large part of why this happens and in general why mutable structs are sort of wonky is because PowerShell doesn't and can't support `ref`.  It does have `PSReference` (aka `[ref]`), which sort of emulates `ref` but only really for variables. \r\n\r\nWell I do have an idea for how the concept of `ref` could be implemented in PowerShell safely.  It should however be stressed that:\r\n\r\n_**No one should work on this**_\r\n\r\nUntil a compelling enough reason is demonstrated.  The scope of these changes are too large to currently justify the benefit, not just in implementation time but also maintenance.\r\n\r\nIf there comes a time when `ref` becomes super important to PowerShell, maybe this will help the poor soul taking on that implementation.\r\n\r\n## `PSDeferredReference`\r\n\r\nThe problem with `ref` when it comes to PowerShell is that you can't store a `ref` on the heap. You can however, store all the information needed to create one. This is sort of like what `[ref]` does,\r\nbut it's a bit unwieldy. \r\n\r\n1. It only works with `PSVariable` as it's source\r\n2. It requires you to manipulate it through it's `Value` property\r\n\r\nTo solve these problems, `ref` should be implemented as a new type of dynamic meta object similar to `PSObject`. Given the example of an array reference, the meta object would contain a reference to the whole array and the index requested.\r\n\r\nEvery binder would need to be updated to account for this.\r\n\r\n### `PSInvokeMemberBinder` (and similar)\r\n\r\n If passed as an argument, use for the following\r\n\r\n- Strictly typed `ref` arguments (maybe requiring `[ref]` or a new keyword/type accelerator)\r\n- Loosely typed by value arguments (e.g. allow type conversion as usual)\r\n- Most importantly, the actual meta object should *never* be passed as is. C# code shouldn't have\r\n  to know what it is\r\n\r\nIf used as the instance\r\n\r\n- If reference type or immutable value type use the value as the instance\r\n- If mutable value type use the reference as the instance\r\n\r\n### `PSVariableAssignmentBinder`, `PSPipeWriterBinder` and `PSToArrayBinder`\r\n\r\n**Always** process by *value*. Never save or write the meta object somewhere accessible.\r\n\r\n*Maybe* allow saving to a variable with `[ref]` syntax to mirror C#, but never let the user really see it. For example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$array = [int[]](0..10)\r\n[ref] $value = [ref] $array[0]\r\n\r\n[string]$value.GetType()\r\n# int\r\n\r\n[object]$value\r\n# 0\r\n\r\n$value = 30\r\n$array[0]\r\n# 30\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe most important requirement for the meta object imo is that it must be as invisible as a managed pointer (`ref`) in C#.\r\n\r\n### PSGetIndexBinder\r\n\r\nWhen the `[ref]` syntax is used and a `ref` return is supported by the indexer, return a deferred reference. This should include at least arrays and ideally also `Memory<T>`.\r\n\r\n### PSGetMemberBinder\r\n\r\nWhen the `[ref]` syntax is used with a mutable field access or (maybe) `ref` property, return a deferred reference.\r\n\r\n### All other binders\r\n\r\nAll others need to be aware of the meta object and operate on the value directly.\r\n\r\n### `ref` parameters in PowerShell class methods\r\n\r\nThis could also be used to add support for `ref`/`out`/`in` parameters in PowerShell class methods. Since class methods are implemented by a generated method calling a scriptblock, the generated method could look something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nclass MyRefTest {\r\n    static [void] Test([int] $byValueArg, [ref] [int] $byRefArg) {\r\n        $byRefArg = 10\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class MyRefTest\r\n{\r\n    public static unsafe void Test(int byValueArg, ref int byRefArg)\r\n    {\r\n        fixed (void* pByRefArg = &byRefArg)\r\n        {\r\n            using var mpByRefArg = new PSManagedPointer((IntPtr)pByRefArg);\r\n            MyRefTest_<staticHelpers>.<Test_1_1>.InvokeHelper(\r\n                instance: null,\r\n                sessionStateInternal: null,\r\n                new object[] { byValueArg, mpByRefArg });\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\ninternal class PSManagedPointer : PSDeferredReference, IDisposable\r\n{\r\n    private readonly IntPtr _managedPointer;\r\n\r\n    private bool _isDisposed;\r\n\r\n    public PSManagedPointer(IntPtr managedPointer) => _managedPointer = managedPointer;\r\n\r\n    // Unsure if this would be an abstract method on `PSDeferredReference` or just part of\r\n    // some kind of new `PSGetReference` binder.\r\n    public unsafe ref T GetRef<T>()\r\n    {\r\n        // Use this as the runtime equivalent to Roslyn's stackalloc escape analysis.\r\n        if (_isDisposed) throw new ObjectDisposedException(this);\r\n        return ref Unsafe.AsRef((void*)_managedPointer);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could remain safe because you can ensure that the managed pointer would only be used for the lifetime of the method invocation.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\nSince this meta object would need to perform an action every time the deferred reference is used, there are some notable problems.\r\n\r\n1. `ref` return methods would still not be possible to support. Every access would require another method invocation\r\n2. Performance would be worse than actual managed pointers. Though probably still not *measurably* worse than current behavior in most contexts\r\n3. The binder would need to be less forgiving with out of range and/or null handling. Or require some trickery with `Unsafe.AsRef<T>((void*)null)` and `Unsafe.IsNull<T>(ref T)`\r\n4. Binder code would likely double, maybe triple. Note that `Binders.cs` is currently 7,762 lines\r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Added how it could be used to add support for `ref` parameters in PowerShell classes as well.",
