    "body": "+1, but I wouldn't frame the issue in terms of `$null`, but in terms of (possibly implicit) _to-Boolean conversion_.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Explicit\r\nPS> [bool] [DbNull]::Value\r\nTrue # !! Should be $false\r\n\r\n# Implicit\r\nPS> if ([DbNull]::Value) { 'have value' }\r\nhave value # !! conditional was unexpectedly $true\r\n```\r\n\r\nSecondarily, the question is how _direct comparison with `$null`_ should be handled.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> $null -eq [DbNull]::Value\r\nFalse   # !! Should probably be true.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, there is only _one_ RHS value other than `$null` itself that yields `$true` with `-eq`, and that is `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value`, the \"array-valued null\" that commands that do not produce output technically return.\r\n\r\nYou could argue that `[DbNull]::Value` should similarly be considered a \"subspecies\" of `$null`, in which case the above should yield `$true` also.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
