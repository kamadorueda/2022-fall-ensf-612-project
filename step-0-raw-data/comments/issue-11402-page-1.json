If you're loading an assembly\r\n# from the GAC in core then you need to manually import all dependencies. A easier\r\n# route would be using something like nuget to manage and distribute the assemblies\r\n# with the script.\r\nAdd-Type -Path (Get-GACAssemblyPath -AssemblyName office)\r\nAdd-Type -Path (Get-GACAssemblyPath -AssemblyName Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook)\r\n\r\n# This will be properly typed and still functional\r\n$outlook = [Microsoft.Office.Interop.Outlook.ApplicationClass]::new()\r\n$mapi = $outlook.GetNamespace('MAPI')\r\n\r\nRegister-ObjectEvent -InputObject $outlook -EventName AdvancedSearchComplete -ErrorAction Stop\r\n```",
