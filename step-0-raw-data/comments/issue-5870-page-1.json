    "body": "@Jaykul Thanks for the short and clear thought. I totally agree that the time has come and we have to complete this story that lasts two years.\r\n\r\nRelated #214 #3610 \r\n\r\nBased on previous discussions we know that some users want all the Windows aliases, some ones only part, some ones do not want them at all. We have also come to the conclusion that aliases only make sense in an interactive session and should (must) be excluded from scripts.\r\n\r\nSo I see a simple solution that we can implement in steps:\r\nStep 1. Create compatibility modules (I suggest use `Compatibility-` name prefix for them):\r\n- The first only aliases without conflicts (current list which we use now) (`Compatibility-Aliases-DefaultSet`)\r\n- The second includes all aliases from previous module and curently excluded Windows PowerShell aliases (`Compatibility-Aliases-ShortWindowsSet`).\r\n- The third includes all Windows PowerShell aliases (`Compatibility-Aliases-FullWindowsSet`). \r\n\r\nStep 2. Import these modules only in the interactive session. We could add a new setting `InteractiveOnly = $true` to a module manifest. This feature will be useful for all compatibility modules and PSReadline. (Related #3956)\r\n\r\nStep 3. Enable an user to choose which compatibility module to download or not to download at all using a configuration file (we already have `powershell.config.json`) and GPO. Until we implement the option users can load selected compatibility module using their profile file.\r\n\r\nStep 4. Add an option to disable/enable aliases in scripts - enhance strict mode (run time) or/and `using language aliases allow=$false` statement (parse time). Add global option (to a configuration file  `powershell.config.json` and GPO) to enable/disable aliases in scripts.",
