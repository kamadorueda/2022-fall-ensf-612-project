    "body": "The problem is that `GetBufferContents()` doesn't understand ANSI.  It only works for `[ConsoleColor]` really.  Internally, it's calling `GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo()` which returns a `CONSOLE_SCREEN_BUFFER_INFO` which is limited to certain [attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-screen-buffers#character-attributes).\r\n\r\nThe win32 API would need to change to give the full set of attributes supported by ANSI.  Best bet would be to ask the https://github.com/Microsoft/Terminal folks (which also owns conhost) to support this.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/100060912/dc77b180-764a-11e9-9e12-aace7d0ecd7d\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/terminal\">GitHub - microsoft/terminal: The new Windows Terminal and the original Windows console host, all in the same place!</a></strong></div><div>The new Windows Terminal and the original Windows console host, all in the same place! - GitHub - microsoft/terminal: The new Windows Terminal and the original Windows console host, all in the same...</div></blockquote>",
