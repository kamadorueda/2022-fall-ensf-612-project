Right-click to paste also got the order right, but omitted the newline (which I believe is a known limitation in that form of paste).\r\n\r\nSome followup questions:\r\n\r\n- How are you copying?\r\n- How are you pasting?\r\n- Are you running normal pwsh.exe in the conhost (as in my screenshot), or are you running it in another terminal emulator (like Windows terminal or Hyper)?\r\n- ~~Does this also occur with powershell.exe?~~ See that this is the case\r\n- Does this also occur with the current PowerShell preview (7.1.0-preview.2)?\r\n- Does this occur for you on any other machines?\r\n- Does this occur with any other Electron applications, like VSCode or Slack, or possibly Chrome?",
