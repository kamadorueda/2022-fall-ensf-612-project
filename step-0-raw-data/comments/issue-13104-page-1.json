    "body": "In terms of terminology, @kilasuit, I recommend talking about _dictionaries_ or _hash tables_, not _simple objects_, because we want to distinguish objects whose _properties_ (from a .NET type perspective) to operate on from dictionary-like types that happen to use .NET properties to store a collection of _key-value pair_ entries. I also suggest removing the reference to `Get-Process` from the title, and to close the effective  duplicate, #13103, now that we've established that the behavior applies to the parameter binder in general, not to specific cmdlets.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, it makes sense to treat objects with bona fide _properties_ and _dictionaries_ (hash tables) _interchangeably_, as is already the case in many contexts; e.g., we've implemented that recently for `Select-Object`; similarly, `ConvertTo-Json` supports hash-table input, and #10999 suggests adding such support to `Export-Csv` / `ConvertTo-Csv`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@SeeminglyScience, while with your specific code the behavior would indeed change, note that `$Hashtable` would still _also_ be bound, and - as seems more likely - if you put the two parameters into _separate parameter sets_ and use `$PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName`, things will work as before, because the type-as-a-whole `ValueFromPipeline` binding (sensibly) takes precedence:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nclass Foo {\r\n  [string] $Name = 'Property'\r\n  [string] ToString() { return 'Whole object' }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Test-Function {\r\n  [CmdletBinding()]\r\n  param(\r\n      [Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName, ParameterSetName='Property')]\r\n      # [Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]\r\n      [string] $Name,\r\n\r\n      [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline, ParameterSetName='WholeObj')]\r\n      # [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline)]\r\n      [Foo] $WholeObj\r\n  )\r\n  process {\r\n      \"Parameter set: $($PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName)\"\r\n      if ($PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey('Name')) {\r\n          $Name.ToString()\r\n      }\r\n      if ($PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey('WholeObj')) {\r\n        $WholeObj.ToString()\r\n      }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Foo]::new() | Test-Function\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above yields:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nParameter set: WholeObj\r\nWhole object\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you _don't_ use distinct parameters sets (use the commented-out `[Parameter(...)]` lines instead), you'll see that _both_ parameters are bound:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nParameter set: __AllParameterSets\r\nProperty\r\nWhole object\r\n```\r\n\r\nTrue, the proposed change would then also bind `$Name` in cases where it didn't before, but, overall, I think this proposal is worth considering, and the technically breaking change strikes me as falling into [Bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

My Bad.\r\n\r\nIn terms of education around terminology @mklement0 we need to be mindful of those coming to PowerShell at all ages & skill sets, because, for example, I fully intend to teach my ten year old son all about PowerShell & will look forward to the day where he teaches me about it instead of me teaching him. \r\n\r\nEven so, this is starting to feel very much like it may actually have been an unfortunate design flaw in the cmdlet that may possibly even date back to v1 days ",
