The changes outlined here cut memory usage to 1/4 of what it was previously if the root element is an array and ~75% of what it was if it's an object.\r\n\r\nThe high memory usage of Powershell with API use-cases was the primary reason we moved most of our projects to C#. I've talked with a lot of people who have moved to C# or Python due to the overhead related to parsing JSON. Instead of complaining I figured i'd take a stab at it and get some experience working with the codebase.\r\n\r\nIf you guys don't want to merge the changes that's totally fine!",
