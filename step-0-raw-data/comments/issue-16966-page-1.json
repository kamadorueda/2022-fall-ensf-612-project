The same mechanism for looking up a command in `PATH` is the same on Linux as it is on Windows. The only notable difference is that Linux uses `:` as a separator whereas Windows uses `;`. You can use `[IO.Path]::PathSeparator` to get that in a platform independent way.\r\n\r\nFor example I created my own executable in `/tmp/test_bin/my_bin` and you can see that it was referenced as soon as I updated `$env:PATH`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/157023185-fd228d3f-14d1-4e82-ad41-f71c0183fa36.png)\r\n\r\nIn your case if you've added `/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin` to `$env:PATH` then either that path doesn't actually exist or the file `brew` in the directory is not executable.\r\n\r\nOne last thing to keep in mind is that this is set per process, if you close and reopen PowerShell the changes are no persisted. You need to either set it in your `profile.ps1` https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/understanding-the-six-powershell-profiles/ or whatever is spawning PowerShell.",
