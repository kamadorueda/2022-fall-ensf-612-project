It would have to be tested but I believe if you add a process to a job after it has started to a job then only processes it subsequently spawns (and not ones it has already) will be part of that job and thus will be waiting on. There's also the difficulty when dealing with processes that are already part of an existing job. There are 3 concerning behaviours that would need to be considered:\r\n\r\n* On older OS' (pre Win8/Server 2012) you cannot have nested jobs\r\n  * If the process is already part of a job (WinRM session is one of those) then it will fail\r\n* If the process is already part of a job then the job we assign needs to be a nested job\r\n  * I'm not even sure how you can create a nested job\r\n  * There's also a limitation if the existing job has UI limits placed upon the job\r\n* There's a run condition where the process exists when `Wait-Process` starts but exists when creating the job\r\n  * This is probably more just something to keep in mind if it's implemented as we can ignore the failure\r\n  * `Start-Process` doesn't suffer from this because the process is created as a suspended process and isn't resumed until after it's added to the job\r\n\r\nI feel that there are enough edge cases here to consider keeping the behaviour as is. The alternative is to have `Wait-Process` try and wait for all the child processes but revert back to the original behaviour sometimes and those sometimes will be hard for the caller to really determine.",

As well as being a most undesirable BC breaking surprise, it'd just be confusing, and I'm not sure it'd be possible to do in a race-free manner for arbitrary process IDs anyway.\r\n\r\nI was extremely confused by all this for some time, because I couldn't understand how `Start-Process -Wait` continued to block if the child process actually exited immediately, as it seemed to. It took reading the sources to finally understand what was going on. It took a lot of time and test test case writing to work it out.\r\n\r\nA possible solution might be to return a wrapper or subclass of `System.Diagnostics.Process` from `Start-Process -PassThru` that tracks the child processes like [`ProcessCollection`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/088eb6d0396fb78565cc9af91a2ddd40d80438c9/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/Process.cs#L2616) does. Then a new `WaitProcess -WaitForChildren` would require an object of that type as its input, refusing to try to wait for an arbitrary `System.Diagnostics.Process`'s children.\r\n\r\nIt'd be *better* if `Wait-Process` could assemble a child process graph when it starts waiting, and maintain it even once the target exits, but that'd suffer from obvious race conditions when the target process exits before `Wait-Process` has finished enumerating its children. So it might be better not to allow that, or to provide a separate cmdlet to `Get-ProcessTree` for a process.\r\n\r\n(I wrote some stuff about runas, trustlevel, etc here, but I'll actually raise a separate issue for it.)",

    "body": "@jborean93 I'm reporting a defect and inconsistency. I don't have a strong opinion on the \"right\" fix.\r\n\r\nTo understand the full picture in which this fits, take a look at the attached horror script I concocted to run a child process without admin privileges, stream its stdout to the current window, and kill the process tree if the powershell script is terminated. File ext is `.txt` because github is fussy. I've only been using Powershell for a week or two, so there are probably lots of things in there that are not done the optimal way, but it should give you the idea. Compare the \"is admin\" vs \"not admin\" branches...\r\n[trustlevel.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/6635702/trustlevel.txt)\r\n\r\nA doc fix is *definitely* needed. But beyond that, when it comes to behaviour I see a few options.\r\n\r\n* Give `Start-Process` a new `-NoWaitForChildren` flag or something, document that it behaves like `Wait-Process`, document that `-Start` has special child process tracking behaviour, and document in `Wait-Process` that child procs are not waited for; or\r\n* Teach `Start-Process -PassThru` to return a subclass or wrapper for `System.Diagnostics.Process` that tracks child processes. Add a new `Wait-Process -WaitForChildren` that requires the extended Process object as an InputObject, so it cannot work on an arbitrary process obtained from `Get-Process`. Document this special case.\r\n\r\nEssentially I want consistency and predictability of behaviour, and the behaviour clearly reflected in the docs.\r\n\r\n@vexx32 \r\n\r\n>I do think the asymmetry here is concerning, and doesn't make a lot of sense though; folks will use Start-Process -Wait and then be very confused when they try to do similar with Wait-Process for processes they haven't directly started themselves, and something may break because they behave differently.\r\n\r\nOr in my case, a process I did start myself, as a lower trustlevel, where I wanted to read and echo its output while it was running. You'd think that'd be easy, but you'd be wrong. `runas.exe` exits immediately and offers no way to connect a child process's stdio (or get its exit code).\r\n\r\n@rkeithhill  Yeah, I'll submit an issue. I've spent a couple of days on this already so I can't presently update the docs, but I will try to get to it once the work delayed by working around this is done.",
