And can we have the error in the event log be more actionable? Just popping an error message seems less than desirable. \r\n\r\nif this POLICY can not actually be used to configure a console endpoint for a given user, then the documentation should say so. It currently does not, and it does not say which endpoint should be in the policy - the name or the URI.\r\n\r\nA particular use case here is for JEA sessions. If user JerryG logs into a DC, his PowerShell session should be a JEA-based session, or possibly a session that has had a start up script defined. I want to set, by policy, that the user does not use the normal endpoint. \r\n\r\nIf this policy can not be used to configure a default console for non-elevated cases, I am not entirely sure what the purpose of this GPO policy is?",

    "body": "Honestly I'm not sure, I wouldn't have thought using WSMan would be necessary at all but the whole configuration endpoint/JEA is highly tied into the WSMan stack so I'm also not surprised it is using it. When you look at the default options you can see the following groups have been allowed to access the endpoint\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/106346639-3aa76500-6304-11eb-8699-00b3183beb61.png)\r\n\r\n* Administrators\r\n* Remote Management Users\r\n* INTERACTIVE\r\n\r\nObviously your account does not have the `Administrators` group as it isn't an admin. Typically a WSMan logon will result in a `NETWORK` logon but after testing it does look like PowerShell is passing down the [WSMAN_OPTION_USE_INTERACTIVE_TOKEN ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/2784add414393b0ecab798055cfbac0d363c1c1e/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/fanin/WSManNativeAPI.cs#L521) that tells WSMan to use the current interactive token when it spawns the shell.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/106346764-0b452800-6305-11eb-9b89-2c554e598078.png)\r\n\r\nSo going by this logic than a non-admin should have access to that endpoint as it will be spawned by an interactive logon but this is where I think WSMan has changed recently. It seems like it no longer allows a loopback logon if the caller is not an admin. You can even see it in action when you try and connect back to localhost with `Invoke-Command`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/106347424-0c2c8880-630a-11eb-89c3-01122e928f9b.png)\r\n\r\nIt does seem like `-EnableNetworkAccess` can get past this so I don't now why `WSMAN_OPTION_USE_INTERACTIVE_TOKEN ` isn't also applied for this use case, someone more knowledable in the setup will probably have to answer that.\r\n\r\nAs for why the policy exists I think it may be a historical policy and recent changes make it less useful. The actual change occurred only in 2019 https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/windows-security-change-affecting-powershell/.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2018/09/Powershell_256.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2019/02/Powershell_2561.png\" height=\"14\"> PowerShell</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/windows-security-change-affecting-powershell/\">Windows Security change affecting PowerShell | PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>Windows Security change affecting PowerShell January 9, 2019 The recent (1/8/2019) Windows security patch CVE-2019-0543, has introduced a breaking change for a PowerShell remoting scenario.
