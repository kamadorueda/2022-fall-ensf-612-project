LiteralPath is not the default parameter set.

However using PathType Any is totally useless as it's the default behaviour without specifying the PathType param at all!",

I'll take to cmdlet working group, because I can see that people expect that if e.g. \r\n`Get-ChildItem -Directory *`   returned items `Test-Path -container *` returns true , but I can't see anyone relying on the behaviour relying on the order of creation.
