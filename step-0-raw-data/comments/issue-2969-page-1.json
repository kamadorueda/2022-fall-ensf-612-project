It calls `ShellExecuteEx` directly in MTA thread instead of from STA thread as suggested in [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762154(v=vs.85).aspx). Therefore, the current solution may not work for some shell extensions that require COM.\r\n\r\nIn .NET Core, managed threads are all eagerly initialized with MTA mode, so to call `ShellExecuteEx` from a STA thread, we need to create a native thread using `CreateThread` function and initialize COM with STA on that thread. In #3281, we are calling `ShellExecuteEx` directly on MTA thread, and it works for things like opening a folder in File Explorer, opening a file with the application that is associated with its extension in shell, opening URL in web browser and etc, but it's not guaranteed to work in all ShellExecution scenarios.\r\n\r\nI will keep this issue open even after merging that PR to track the \"invoke-on-STA-thread\" work.",
