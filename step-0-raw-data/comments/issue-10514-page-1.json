It might be a long time before I got it working. I am solid (many years) on C, ok on C++, and newbie to C#. What would I face? I only have Visual Studio community edition. Can it be done with that? I also have Linux machines. What toolset is needed on Linux?\r\n\r\nI think my first step is to gather the infrastructure and configuration and see if I can build something that works without making any change.",

I only use VS 2019.\r\n\r\nOne tip I'll share that works very well for me: I use VS 2019 only for editing files, because I like VS as an editor. I use PowerShell and the `./build.psm1` module for building PowerShell. Using PowerShell for the build process allows you to leverage all of the command-line work that has already been done.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to get going IMHO is to fork the repo, clone it, create a new branch for whatever changes you want to work on, import the `build.psm1` module, invoke `Start-PSBootstrap` from your PowerShell folder, then invoke `Start-PSBuild` from that folder. Once you have it built at least once, _only then_ do I open the solution in Visual Studio for file editing.",
