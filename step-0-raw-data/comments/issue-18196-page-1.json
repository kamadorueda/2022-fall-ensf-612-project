    "body": "> @dkaszews, only Windows PowerShell does; the linked comment summarizes the non-plain-text parameters supported in Windows PowerShell that PS Core no longer supports. The question is if there's a willingness to bring non-plain-text support back, and to what degree it can be implemented in a platform-agnostic fashion - having platform-specific parameters is generally undesirable.\r\n\r\nAs one guiding principle, platform specific parameters ARE undesirable    \r\nAs a second principle, PowerShell 7 on Windows should have parity with Windows PowerShell 5.    \r\nAnd when these principles come into conflict they need to be dealt with on a case by case basis. \r\n\r\nI have an open issue with Import-Excel where we do something which relies on the Windows PowerShell functionality, and it is a lot of trouble for a rarely used feature (a command to get a picture from an Excel workbook and save it) to work around it, So I would prefer \"Parity with Windows PowerShell\" to win. Other preferences are available, and valid :-) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Or is Microsoft just a name, and the project has nothing to do with the corporation?\r\n\r\nThere are two primary reasons (a) The code is something which cannot be open sourced, for whatever reason and (b) for some reason it was supported in .NET Framework but is not longer available in current .NET (and WHY? is a valid question there). Clipboard support went away in V6 for .NET related reasons, and came back in V7; I think in V7 it may be different code, or possibly just the subset of code which works cross platform . Sometimes teams in Microsoft do re-invent the wheel rather than using something from another group, but I don't think is what is happening here. \r\n\r\n",
