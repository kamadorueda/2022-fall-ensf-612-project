Instead, it has to use `Import-Module` about 50 times to load specific versions of each of it's dependencies. \r\n\r\nBecause, you know, if they used RequiredModules they would run into this bug.\r\n\r\n## And they are *NEVER* going to be able to stop doing that.\r\n\r\nNot only do I not have any metadata about the dependencies of AzureRM (which is, basically, the **entire reason** for the existence of this module), but the Azure team is actually having to *bypass* the PowerShellGet module to publish to the gallery every time: they're adding the dependency information to the NuGet package even though it's not in the module.\r\n\r\nAs a PowerShell scripter, there's no way for me to figure out that _AzureRm.profile_ **3.4** is what shipped as part of _AzureRm_ **4.4**, and that _AzureRm.profile_ **4.0** wasn't included until _AzureRm_ version **5.0.0** -- except to query the **gallery** metadata\r\n\r\nAs a PowerShell module author, I'm going to have to duplicate their hack to build metamodule nuspec files that don't reflect my module manifest...",
