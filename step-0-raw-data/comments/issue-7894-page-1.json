    "body": "Thanks for link to Win32 ConPTY. \r\nA problem is that the API is only on latest Windows preview builds and PowerShell Core should works from Windows 7 version. We could use winpty and then migrate to ConPTY. Although it looks too difficult to support. On the other hand, it could be an independent project in which an alternative conhost will be implemented (as well as a GUI). All this is said for the local console.\r\nAnd again, as for remote console, current PowerShell remoting is engine-engine object oriented. Although we use implicitly pty on Unix if transport is SSH there can not be two foreground applications by design. So we'll need to switch between foreground and background on local and remote systems synchronously. This means that we will need to completely remake our conhost, which will require several ported APIs that are not yet available (not only ConPTY).",
