    "body": "> I _very_ wonder why we mask BUGs which are revealed by the tests?\r\n\r\nThis is not hiding bugs, but to fix our test script. Blindly running all xUnit tests in parallel is just wrong. Please take a look at the original script in `Start-PSxUnit` before your changes in #8356, the tests are categorized into `PSTests.Sequential` and `PSTests.Parallel` namespaces and the original script ran the `PSTests.Sequential` tests sequentially, and run `PSTests.Parallel` tests in parallel.\r\n\r\nThe categorization was for a reason -- config files get created and deleted in `test_PSConfiguration.cs`, and that will definitely cause unusually frequent race conditions with tests in `test_Runspace.cs`. That's why they are categorized into `PSTests.Sequential` namespace. **Using default values when failed to access the file as you suggested won't help here, because that will still make the setting values unpredictable and cause the tests to fail randomly -- a test might expect a specific value of a setting but it gets a default value because of the race condition.**\r\n\r\nI could make the test script behave like before -- running `PSTests.Sequential` namespace tests in sequence and `PSTests.Parallel` namespace tests in parallel, but I chose to not do that because:\r\n1. we have to use the xunit config file to disable parallel, which make it cumbersome to run part of the tests sequentially and other part in parallel.\r\n2. it makes writing xunit test harder by requiring the author to know which namespace to use for his/her tests.\r\n\r\n**Be noted that, fixing the test script doesn't mean we don't want to fix the race condition issue regard to processing the config file.**\r\n\r\n> Are we going to release 6.2 version that is subject to DoS attack by unprivileged user?\r\n\r\n@TravisEz13 and I chatted about this offline and we believe this is not a release blocker because it's already an existing issue.\r\n\r\n> Are we going to release 6.2 version in which hosting applications will fall unpredictably in 9% of cases?\r\n\r\nThe 9% failure was because of the frequent creation/deletion of the config files within `test_PSConfiguration.cs`, which would be really really rare to happen in real scenarios.",
