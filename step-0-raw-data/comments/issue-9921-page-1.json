Or is there some competing interest that favors a single process-wide PSModulePath?\r\n\r\nThat's a very good question, and one I think needs more design thought.\r\n\r\nMy thinking is:\r\n- The PSModulePath has always been an env var and in PS 6+ can be configured in the powershell.config.json file. The first is process-wide, the second is PowerShell-install-wide (i.e. even wider, since all PowerShell processes started from that pwsh.exe will have that PSModulePath)\r\n- Changing that would be a pretty big breaking change, so undesirable\r\n- But as an env var, different runspaces shouldn't reset it -- it should be initialized once, possibly by the default runspace\r\n- Runspace pool implementors should only mutate PSModulePath with care, and ideally just load modules directly anyway",

Note that at least the Runspace, RunspacePool, and PowerShell classes can lead to opening a runspace, so it can be a bit of an undertaking to root out all such calls.\r\n* Immediately overwrite PSModulePath with startingPSModulePath each time a runspace is opened.\r\n* There will still be a (usually short) period when PSModulePath is in the reset state while the runspace is being opened, but before the overwrite has a chance to occur.\r\n* If a call to Import-Module (or a second call to Runspace.Open() for that matter) coincides with that period then module importing can fail.\r\n* The failed module importing manifests intermittently because it depends on the coincidental timing of opening runspaces and importing modules.\r\n* This dramatically reduces the occurrence of failed module imports in multiple runspace scenarios which means development on such projects can continue.  But such failures are still a statistical certainty with a likelihood that is probably higher than what most organizations can tolerate for production.\r\n\r\n",

Currently `$ENV:PSModulePath` is mutable, so any user code could mutate it.  I've certainly encountered such code.  It will be very easy to unknowingly invoke such code in a multi-threaded runspace scenario.  But I suppose that's a different issue from this one. :relaxed: ",

If a user sets the module path in their prompt, we have no way to guarantee that that gets used anywhere before it's tampered with by PowerShell.\r\n\r\nBasically having something that constructs a new ModuleInstrinsics object makes PSModulePath unpredictable. On first startup it makes sense that we set the module path, but when a create a new runspace, I don't see any upsides to mutating the module path again. I also feel that we ought to not do it using a complex series of methods in a parameterless constructor.",
