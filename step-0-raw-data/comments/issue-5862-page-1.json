We can put it back for 6.1.0.  But if we left it, after GA the bar for breaking changes is significantly higher and it would effectively be there forever.\r\n\r\nI think the principal of least astonishment applies and in this case using `sc start winrm` appears to have worked as no error is reported, but instead created a file called `start` containing `winrm` because it was aliased to `Set-Content`.\r\n\r\nIt's unfortunate that the other examples you bring up were not discussed along with `sc`.  However, in those cases the usage would have returned an error making it clear that you used the alias and not the native tool which is different from the `sc.exe` case.",

    "body": "Just for the record, and to vent, regarding this particular change:\r\n\r\nWhen someone suggests that the \"principle of least astonishment\" argues for _removal_ of an existing alias, it feels a bit like an insult. That person doesn't seem to care about me, nor about my friends and co-workers. They are ignoring the user base of people who've been using, learning, and promoting PowerShell for years, and ignoring our code-base of existing code.  There are a lot of us, and a lot of  our code. **That's a lot of astonishment.**\r\n\r\nAdditionally, in this particular case, if \"we\" accidentally change a service because we called `sc.exe` inadvertently, that's going to be a lot more painful than if a new user accidentally creates a file called \"config\" or \"start\" because they called `Set-Content` without realizing it...\r\n\r\nWhen someone says \"you shouldn't use aliases in your scripts\" it feels patronizing and misguided. It's the wrong argument at the wrong time. The *only* reason we have said in the past that you shouldn't use aliases in scripts is for _readability_. It was never about breaking changes, because the built-in aliases have always been (until Core) dependable:\r\n\r\n1. They are always defined in a clean environment, even before any modules are imported\r\n2. The backward compatibility commitment from Microsoft meant they _would always_ be there --as they have been, for over a decade.\r\n\r\nIn fact, because they are hard-coded and ReadOnly, it has always been **harder** for a user to _change_ a built-in alias than to overwrite a command with a function from a module or with an alias! Built-in aliases are therefore as safe and dependable as any PowerShell code can be, and so the use of them was down to readability. \r\n\r\nI've made this argument frequently: _in many cases, aliases are more readable than the full command_, especially years ago when Windows Powershell was new, and we were a group of people familiar with the old cmd and bash utilities. An alias like `dir` or `ls` was so much clearer than the new `Get-ChildItem` command. Not just easier to type, but readable to a much broader range of people.\r\n\r\nAnyway. Having vented all of that, we don't need to debate this particular alias. What's done is done. It's shipped. It's broken, and it can't be unbroken.\r\n\r\n## The question is: \r\n\r\nDoes the PowerShell Team intend to follow their own guidelines, and live up to the commitment to avoid breaking changes, or is that just, as Ilya says, too much work?\r\n\r\nIf you're not going to do it, it would be prudent to rewrite your documents to say what you're willing to actually do -- better to anger a people over lowered expectations and a documentation change than over broken promises.",

    "body": "Thanks for being so frank, everyone. This is clearly a controversial issue, and I appreciate everyone for providing your input and being level-headed. \r\n\r\nI wholeheartedly agree that we screwed up here from a governance and timing perspective. While @iSazonov is right that we don't require RFCs for smaller changes like this (smaller in the sense that the change doesn't require a design, not in the sense of the *scope* of the impact), it doesn't excuse the fact that we violated the *spirit* of our governance model. And I certainly agree that we should update our governance documentation to codify the reality of the RFC vs. small change process. \r\n\r\n@Jaykul is also right in that we didn't plan on sneaking this in, and that it came up at the 11th hour. I'm very sorry that I missed the initial conversation on `sc` from way back when (or maybe I just don't remember), but I promise you that this was a case of \"oh, crap, we missed something\" rather than a sneaky move.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, we did have a long discussion on the implications of this, and even with the community input, I still would've personally made the same decision. While controversial, [our stance on aliases has been pretty clear over the last few years](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/214): namely, that they're almost purely for interactive usage, that they shouldn't and can't be used to provide truly deterministic behavior in scripts/modules shared outside of your personal usage, and that you should add aliases as appropriate to your profiles or within module scope if you want them. \r\n\r\nFor example, @JamesWTruher uses all of the POSIX-y aliases like `ls` and `cp` on his Mac, and he put them back in his profile the day we took them out. We *encourage* this. And as the [WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityPack](https://github.com/PowerShell/WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityPack) gets developed, there'll be mechanisms to make it easier to put them back where you want it.\r\n\r\nAnd while I know that your inclination is to say \"well just take them all out!\" (I'm looking at #5870), aliases are *way* more egregious when they collide with native executables. It's how we ended up with the curl/wget problem and it's why we removed the POSIX-y aliases on macOS/Linux. I understand that many of you have worked around it, built your muscle memory, and understand what's going on, but @SteveL-MSFT is right in that the lack of an error message from Set-Content makes this really hard to figure out.\r\n\r\nSo in summary: I'm very sorry that we about removing `sc` like this, and I completely understand the frustration coming from all of you, as this issue is definitely not cut-and-dry. We had to make hard decisions on breaking some stuff, and weighing that against back compat and potential adoption. I hope you also understand, though, that we truly didn't make this one lightly (even if that's how it appeared). ",

    "body": "For what it's worth, @SteveL-MSFT -- if you look at [that thread](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/214) closely, you'll see that the reason that thread is there is that someone wrote a PSScriptAnalyzer rule saying that aliases are bad -- and the community feedback (of which I was, obviously, a loud voice) was that this is not true, and that many aliases improve readability of code.  The issue you linked to is actually the response to our frustration: an attempt to keep the rule but create a white-list of aliases that we think are better than writing the full command name. You'll also notice the _**complete** lack of action_ on that THREE YEAR OLD issue -- which is why my default mode when it comes to aliases is frustration.\r\n\r\nMy argument at this point is that if you're not committed to _stop changing them_, you should _completely remove them_, instead of changing them randomly when someone points out a collision with something they care about. Your commitment to remove everything that _anyone notices_ collides is breaking your commitment to keep my old code working, and it's very frustrating.",

Any scripts that depend on aliases should not be considered a breaking change. In the Shell, I see the benefit to shorten a multi liner command with aliases. But in a script, it is better to be verbose and use the full Cmdlet name, than to save characters.\r\n\r\nI think this example should be a wake up call to that effect.",
