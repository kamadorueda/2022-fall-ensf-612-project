    "body": "That's the expected behavior --regardless of whether the command in the module is a function, cmdlet, or alias-- a module will only be autoloaded to satisfy the command if the command cannot be found at all without loading the module. If you think about it, you'll realize it couldn't be any other way, or we'd never be able to safely write modules that overwrite existing commands.\r\n\r\nFor example, in Windows PowerShell `glg` is an alias for `Get-LocalGroup` -- try making a glg.cmd file in your path:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\nNew-Item .\\Scripts -Type Directory -Force\r\n$Env:Path += \";\" + (resolve-path .\\Scripts\\).Path\r\nSet-Content .\\Scripts\\glg.cmd \"@echo Hello World\"\r\nGet-Command glg*\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see that glg shows up as an alias _without a definition_, and also as an Application: glg.cmd\r\n\r\nIt will look like the alias comes first in the output of Get-Command, which would mean that it would be what's executed -- but that's only because we triggered Get-Command's _search_ mode by using a wildcard, try this:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\nGet-Command glg\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd you'll see that the alias _does not show up_.  In the first output, the fact that the alias had no definition (i.e., it shows an arrow -> with nothing on the right) should have been our clue. If you run `glg` you'll get the batch file ... _unless_ you first import the module:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\nImport-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts\r\nGet-Command glg*\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow you'll see the alias has a definition, so it's going to _actually_ win when we run it --which we can tell by running:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\nGet-Command glg\r\n```",
