    "body": "Note that with example one, that behavior happens whenever there is a parameter type that cannot be resolved.  That can be because an assembly that is loaded at runtime is not yet loaded, a type definition that hasn't been invoked, or even just a typo.\r\n\r\nMy guess is that type resolution throws an exception that isn't handled gracefully until a few more levels up the callstack than would be ideal for completion.\r\n\r\nI don't think example two is an unexpected limitation.  It's decidedly more difficult to implement that based purely on AST.  Once the function is already loaded into the session it becomes a lot easier.\r\n\r\nIt's a great feature request though.  I don't know exactly how feasible it is without changing a significant chunk of code, but `ArgumentCompleterAttribute` feels really inconsistent to a lot of folks.  It's very difficult to understand why it appears to only work *sometimes*.",
