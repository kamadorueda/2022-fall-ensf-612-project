But practically, a message saying \"use -force to delete hidden files\" would be more useful. Alternately we could simply remove the restriction so no message is required.",

    "body": "I'd like to second OP's sentiment that the current behavior feels unintuitive.\r\n\r\nThe semantics and usage of hidden files are fundamentally different between Windows and non-Windows. On Windows, \"hidden\" is a first-class file system attribute that shields the file from various operations at the OS level. In contrast, on Unix-y systems hidden files are just an agreed-upon convention that some applications (chiefly `ls`) observe, but most choose safely ignore; from the OS perspective they are identical to any other file.\r\n\r\nAlso, I would argue that from a certain perspective, this behavior is _not_ consistent within PowerShell - at least for those concerned with writing cross-platform scripts. For example, the following sequence of commands works on Windows but produces an error on Linux:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"hello\" > ./.foo.txt\r\nRemove-Item ./.foo.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nObviously this is a simple example, but there are a number of real-world cases where scripts I have written worked on Windows but were broken on Linux.\r\n\r\nI don't want to get in the habit of defensively adding `-Force` every time I type `Remove-Item`, because I generally appreciate being protected from doing stupid things.",
