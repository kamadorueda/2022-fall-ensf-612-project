    "body": "> In this particular case, how would you even know that any of this involves bits, and why would you care? \r\n\r\nWhen it's an enum with flags (an enum with multiple values) then it will use bits. While I know `Attributes` itself is an enum this because I've dealt with it before you can determine this dynamically\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> Get-Item $pwd.Path | Get-Member -Name Attributes\r\n\r\n   TypeName: System.IO.DirectoryInfo\r\n\r\nName       MemberType Definition\r\n----       ---------- ----------\r\nAttributes Property   System.IO.FileAttributes Attributes {get;set;}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can see it's not a string and by deduction based on the purpose I can usually come to the conclusion it's an enum. When in doubt a quick check online on [System.IO.FileAttributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.fileattributes?view=net-5.0) type or doing `$obj.Attributes -is [Enum]` tells me definitively.\r\n\r\n> And since there is no modifying operator for -bor, the \"correct\" way to do this would be something like this:\r\n\r\nIn your particular use case you need to pass it by type rather than just the string\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$file = Get-Item -Path foo -Force\r\n$file.Attributes = $file.Attributes -bor [IO.FileAttributes]\"Hidden\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because bitwise operations work on numerical values and the operator doesn't know how to cast the string to the possible enum on the LHS. I say possible here because it's perfectly valid to had both the LHS and RHS as just integer fields and not an enum.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I find that sucks is that you need to do `$obj.Attributes = $obj.Attributes -bor` rather than the equivalent to `+=` (in bitwise terms other languages use `|=` to bitwise OR and set at the same time. For example in C# you can do the following to replicate adding and removing a flag (what `-bor` and `-band -bnot` does) to an existing value:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nfile.Attributes |= FileAttributes.Hidden\r\nfile.Attributes &= ~FileAttributes.Hidden\r\n```\r\nBut in PowerShell this isn't possible today which can be annoying.\r\n\r\n> Also I have to say that I'm probably not the only person offended by the quick marking of everything in this project as a \"question\" even when the answer is far from adequate.\r\n\r\nLet me preface the following by saying I am no way affiliated with Microsoft or the PowerShell team and am just a community user of PowerShell who tries to help out where I can.\r\n\r\nFirst off I am sorry that this your experience and can totally understand how closing issue reports quickly can bring across a negative experience. On the flip side you have to understand that this repository is very large with a lot of issues being reported and thus is is very important to try and filter out what are bugs and what might just be misunderstandings or general questions. \r\n\r\nNow this comes to the tricky question of what constitutes a bug and while you may think it is a bug because it doesn't do what you expect the truth of the matter is this is the expected behaviour based on the code shared and there is a proper method to achieve what you want. Personally I would think this is a feature request but even then I am doubtful it would be implemented as this could break existing code that might rely on the current `+=` and `-=` behaviour. PowerShell as a whole is mostly adverse to making breaking changes (5 -> 6 jump being abnormal). An alternative is having 2 methods `AddFlag` and `RemoveFlag` that could do this but you still need the assignment on the LHS so you only really gain a slightly simpler interface.\r\n\r\nI apologise for being blunt but in the end this repo has 3000+ issues and I think getting an actual reponse, even if it's a no or working as intended, is better than receiving nothing at all or having it just left to stagnate over time with no action at all.",

I also think it's pretty unlikely that anyone is relying on the current behavior for `FileAttributes` and maybe for flag enums in general—probably [Bucket 3](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area).  I'm going to look into the possibility/palatability of overloading the `+` and `-` operators for `FileAttributes`, which would implicitly overload `+=` and `-=`.  If that turns out not to be an option (technically or otherwise), I'm going to submit a PR to add `AddAttribute` and `RemoveAttribute` script methods to `FileInfo` to provide a somewhat more apparent way to idempotently modify `FileInfo.Attributes`.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2020/10/dr_scripto.jpg\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2018/10/Microsoft-Favicon.png\" height=\"14\"> Scripting Blog</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/use-a-powershell-cmdlet-to-work-with-file-attributes/\">Use a PowerShell Cmdlet to Work with File Attributes</a></strong></div><div>  Summary: Learn how to use the Windows PowerShell cmdlet Set-ItemProperty to work with file attributes.

Both of those sources discuss performing bitwise operations.\r\n\r\nLet me explain my motivation and reasoning here.\r\n\r\nI am not an advanced PowerShell user, I never read a book and just learned from experimentation and looking up bits of info on the internet.\r\n\r\nSo I googled \"powershell make file hidden\" and the result that came up was:\r\n\r\nhttps://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/33665b03-d383-41ed-a836-fd83c217b3f1/making-files-hidden-with-powershell?forum=ITCG\r\n\r\nwhich gave me this syntax.\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, I tried using this syntax on an already hidden file and noticed the behavior I reported.\r\n\r\nNow, consider this from the perspective of a C++ programmer. I do some C++ although I'm by no means very good at it.\r\n\r\nThe operation:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$attributes += 'attribute'\r\n```\r\n\r\nis **ALREADY** overloaded to take a string. No reasonable person would expect such an operation with a string on the RHS to be arithmetic addition to a bitmask. If only numeric values were allowed, this would be far more obvious.\r\n\r\nSo while it's no surprise that the code on an internet forum was wrong, it looked completely fine to me.\r\n\r\nI'm glad you see my perspective here.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://i1.social.s-msft.com/Forums/GlobalResources/images/Technet/favicon.ico\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/33665b03-d383-41ed-a836-fd83c217b3f1/making-files-hidden-with-powershell?forum=ITCG\">Making files hidden with powershell</a></strong></div></blockquote>",

    "body": "> @237dmitry the issue here is that string values are allowed and they do not exhibit the behavior a user would expect.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell there is an expectation that for a binary expression, the RHS is converted implicitly to the same type as the LHS.  There's also an expectation that conversion paths are a lot more forgiving, for example an implicit conversion my call a static `Parse` method if it exists (like in the case of an enum).\r\n\r\nI can definitely agree that adding two bit flag enum values together can be very unintuitive if you don't know that's what it is doing. That said, being able to use string values as short hand for enum values is a feature that is heavily depended on. This is one of the very few instances where it's slightly problematic.",
