I plan to finish it before PS7 release, but I have not had a lot of time to work on it recently. I'll see if I can get the kinks ironed out by this weekend, and then start getting the necessary PRs in, one at a time. ðŸ™‚ \r\n\r\nAlso, the additional output in 6.2.2 is actually not output. It's data sent to the Information stream with a PSHOST tag to force it to display (much like how `Write-Host` works). It will only display in the console, not actually affecting the output of your script if you capture it into variables or pipe to Out-Null.\r\n\r\nYou can suppress the information stream data in a few ways, but you'll need to work with the redirection operator to do so. One way might be:\r\n\r\n```ps\r\n$( $Result = Test-Connection 1.1.1.1 -Quiet ) 6> $null\r\n```",

    "body": "That makes sense.  I only posted after testing it out when one of the functions in a custom module for work was returning the result from Test-Connection that is piped to Out-Null in the script.  It does not output any results in PS v5.1, but in PS 6.2 it does.  I'll rewrite one of the functions and add something similar to your example above and test it out.  This should suffice until your work is complete.\r\n\r\nThanks @vexx32! ",
