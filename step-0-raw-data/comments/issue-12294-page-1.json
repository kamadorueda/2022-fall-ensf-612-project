The function exists solely to normalize case within a path --- it should NEVER be returning a path to a different file.",

    "body": "> @TravisEz13 Sorry, the day job has distracted me from following through on this and one other PR. I honestly thought the \"location of the code change\" comment was sort of meant to be rhetorical. The bug itself can be scoped to that helper function: In what scenario would I possibly pass a literal, existing directory path to GetCorrectCasedPath() and it would be acceptable to get back a reference to an existing different directory? The function exists solely to normalize case within a path --- it should NEVER be returning a path to a different file.\r\n\r\nHere is the direct call:\r\nhttps://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:powershell/powershell+GetCorrectCasedPath&patternType=literal\r\n\r\nThen, `NormalizePath` is used in these places:\r\nhttps://sourcegraph.com/search?q=repo:powershell/powershell+content:%22Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands%22+content:%22NormalizePath%28%22+lang:c%23++-file:%22src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/RegistryProvider.cs%22&patternType=literal#1\r\n\r\nWe need to make sure we didn't break any of these calls.",

    "body": "@TravisEz13 All of the non-file system paths you reference end up calling a base class version or provider-specific version of NormalizePath() so this change luckily does not affect them.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov I think that might be splitting hairs to some degree.  When somebody does a Set-Location to a specific path, do you want the resultant path at the prompt to be case-accurate or not?  I think it might be hard to address all the \"what if\" sort of cases.  Regardless, this PR was authored to address the \"bug\" within GetCorrectCasedPath() itself so I was hoping not to boil the ocean to get this committed. :-)",
