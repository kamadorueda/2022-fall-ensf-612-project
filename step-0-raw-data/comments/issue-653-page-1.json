Ideally a weekly or biweekly interval I would think.\n\n> Should we release on powershell gallery?\n\nHow would we release Linux packages there?\n\n> we should align our build versioning with tags in app-veyor\n\nI disagree. The AppVeyor versions are entirely arbitrary; they do not correspond to anything in the repository or the Linux builds. We should continue with annotated Git tags following semantic versioning. Can we align AppVeyor versions with our Git tags?\n",
