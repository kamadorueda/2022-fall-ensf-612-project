    "body": "yeah, the architecture of these commands is wrong.\r\n\r\nI would expect that if I say to convert markdown `-AsVT100EncodedString` that I should get *just* the vt encoded string out. I should not need Show-Markdown at that point.  Alternatively, Show-Markdown shouldn't need ConvertFrom-Markdown, and ConvertFrom-Markdown doesn't need that other output.\r\n\r\nI still want the HTML option for ConvertFrom-Markdown -- but this is just confusing.",
