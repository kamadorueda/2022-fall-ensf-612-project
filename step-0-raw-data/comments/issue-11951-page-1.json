Maybe add a mention that it's expected `g` should not be found and is (or seems to be) there for comparison's sake.\r\n\r\nBut what you seem to be saying is that the function `b` should not be able to find the function  `f` and should error out... but the error is missing (though the lack of output indicates it still can't find it).\r\n\r\nThe additional error from 5.1 looks like another bug that has since been fixed, I think.\r\n\r\nInteresting... makes me wonder how defining a module with `New-Module` is _supposed_ to work -- i.e., what are the actual design expectations of the cmdlet in terms of how it handles a module that tries to reference things that aren't available from the global session state. It seems more logical to me that it simply can't see them, since it is after all a module, but it looks like the fact that `f` is both defined and then called from the same scope (albeit via the module, which _should_ only see the global scope) is definitely an edge case that's not been accounted for properly.",

It's not clear to me whether that is the design intent.\r\n\r\nYes - it is definitely the design intent. The goal was that the dynamic environment of the calling function should not interfere with the module command being called. That said, modules are coupled to the global session state because to do otherwise would be prohibitively expensive. Every module would have to include it's own private copy of the cmdlet table, etc.\r\n\r\nWRT the example output, I get:\r\n```powershell\r\ne\r\nf:\r\nLine |\r\n   6 |         function b { f }\r\n     |                      ^ The term 'f' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\ng:\r\nLine |\r\n   7 |         function c { g }\r\n     |                      ^ The term 'g' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n```\r\nSo - a is executed and emits 'e' as expected, and b (f) and c (g) result in errors because they are not in scope for the module functions.
