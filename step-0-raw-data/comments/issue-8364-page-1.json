The current `ToLower` operation is fine for the malicious code scan purpose since we are dealing with a set of English strings. But here, we need to work with different `cultureinfo` because the `$pshome` could contain any characters. So I will have to change the current `ToLower` method to use `char.ToLower` or `char.ToLowerInvariant`, not sure which is the right one.",
