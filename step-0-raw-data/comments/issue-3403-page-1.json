Upgrade your components to match our build requirements.\r\n * Install [VS 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/productinfo/vs2015-sysrequirements-vs) on your Win 7 system. The community edition is free.\r\n * Install an updated version of CMake\r\n2. Try manually modifying the $cmakeGenerator string in Start-PSBuild to a value supported by your existing version of VS and see what happens. I've never done this before so I don't know if it will work or if there are other dependencies.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: we don't officially support Win 7 as a build environment, but you are welcome to experiment with it and see what happens.",
