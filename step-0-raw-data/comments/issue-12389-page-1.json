    "body": "@Conan1989 deserialization of objects is expected behaviour. When you export data to a file, you're _always_ losing some of the data, this isn't avoidable. .NET objects have a lot of metadata in their live state that can't be restored directly.\r\n\r\nWhen constructing a .NET object, we're entirely limited to what their design allows us to provide in terms of data. If we were to try re-creating a live object from every deserialized object, we'd need a pretty complex algorithm to attempt to recreate the object using its available constructors and settable properties, and even then it would most likely fail to be a faithful recreation a majority of the time.\r\n\r\nWhen you load an object that has been serialised like that, it's pulled back in as (effectively) a PSCustomObject with a typename referencing the original type. There aren't really many or any effective ways around that. If you want to try recreating the original object with the available data from the deserialised object, you are more than welcome to try. Typically the results are fairly lacklustre, but it may be enough for your specific use case. ðŸ™‚ ",
