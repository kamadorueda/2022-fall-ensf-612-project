Playing with `$PSStyle.Formatting` a bit more and I found that the color decorations for the warning stream is missed when redirecting the stream to a file, even if `$PSStyle.OutputRendering` is set to be `Ansi`. It's probably the same for the debug and verbose streams as well, but didn't check them myself.",
