Since the decoration is user configurable, users can turn it off completely or adjust\r\n\r\nGiven all the things I'm record saying about the application of colours, you won't be surprised that I want to advise caution on this point. \r\nIn particular: the choice of colours and file extensions they are applied to up to this point seems arbitrary (IIRC ZIPs were formatted as error / danger). Possibly there has been consultation that I'm not aware of, but it feels like choices based on personal tastes rather than usability research.   \r\nIf the _ability to format_ were turned on but the default was not to apply any, users who want specific colours can still apply them. My guess is that making it opt-in would see quite a low take-up, opt-out will see it used by people who find the colours unhelpful, but neither find out how to turn them off, nor complain. \r\n",

This introduced ability to set color of `FileInfo` based on its properties, I can imagine for example ability to color `MatchInfo`s consequitive groups (and not just the entire match) useful, let's say first is blue, second is green, etc. I know there is some way to do it via xml, but this API looks nicer.

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT  well, \"already used\" might mean the \"explosion in a paint factory\"  that is `ls` on linux - a paradigm case of runaway UI changes by people with great expertise in C, but little in usability, resulting in bad experience.  \r\nMy ubuntu/wsl OOB config applies 18 different combinations of colours to 130 file types. What proportion of Linux users know all 18?  As someone who doesn't live in bash, I have no idea why some directories are blue text on black, and others are have a green background, nor what yellow background, or cyan-text on a red background are meant to convey.  Extra information is put front of me but I can't decode it.\r\n\r\nI don't think Windows explorer is unusual keeping all files in one colour, I _think_ most GUI file managers do the same (ready to be corrected). In VS Code colour is used for source control status, not type. And AIUI `ls` uses colour because it defaults to showing many names per line:  _without_ `-l`  colour is the only clue what you can or can't run, or cd into.     \r\nBut DIR going all the way back to the 1980s has marked directories (even in wide mode) and file extensions told you what you could run, so had no need of colour.  \r\n\r\n> we should absolutely not treat \"we should be like bash\" as the ultimate goal\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I also think we should feel able to say that bash introduced something for a reason that doesn't apply here, and it grew into a monster (18 colour combos and 130 file types) that we want to avoid.  Shells _should_ learn from each other, and that includes the mistakes of others.\r\n\r\nExecutables and directories are being coloured not because it is needed, but because that's what people coming to pwsh with a  linux background have grown used to. I can see them complaining that displaying directories in inverse is \"stupid\" and wanting to know \"why can't they be in blue\" (which I see running  `ls  /usr` in bash on wsl - accessibility not being something linux spend much time on :-) )  But special colours for files with a PowerShell extension like ps1xml or psd1? That's just colour for colour's sake.  \r\n\r\nI've tried to explain my accessibility problem and I don't know if the picture below helps to show what it is going on in my brain when this is in front of me.\r\n<img width=\"615\" alt=\"Untitled\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/186730740-aa25192e-6eaa-459d-ac2d-ebf932a45d38.png\">\r\n\r\nI can't _just read_ the stuff I want to read, with the visual hubbub of all those colours it takes extra concentration and in some cases I need to put my hand over the screen to stop my eye being dragged where I don't want it to be.  Possibly that disqualifies me from commenting, as the answer I seem to get is \"we like colours, you can turn yours off\".  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

It works when people are curious. You or I look at it and say \"Neat you _can_ apply formatting, and the formatting I want is... _none_, I'll set that.\" I don't have the same curiosity when I use bash on wsl. I only found how it set the 18 colour combos for 130 file types in replying above. I _could_ make a bash look a bit more what I expect  but I _don't_: I sit their scowling at it for the the defaults that I can't be bothered to change (even the three colour bash prompt). I don't want people who are dragging their feet about moving off Windows PowerShell feeling about pwsh 7.3 the way I feel about bash. \r\n\r\nSet against that, I don't want people who currently use bash feeling that getting the look they want is a battle. Pwsh doing different things on Windows and Linux is one answer to that, but I think that has as many negatives as positives.  \r\nAnd I do understand the desire _not_ to keep formatting secret after introducing it. But look at what I said above `ls` defaults to wide view, only shows names, and needs colours so you what is a directory. In CMD dir /w puts [] around a directory so you can see pick directories out, so the new colours might not be needed in normal view but they going to help wide view right ? \r\n\r\n<img width=\"716\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/187030003-c981e70c-2713-467b-a335-a62083f7abeb.png\">\r\n\r\nNo, actually **the place where colour _would_ benefit pwsh, doesn't use it** (list format doesn't use it either)\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT  I did experiment with better defaults\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/187029178-7812462e-4e0a-4416-8475-913b5692cc0e.png)\r\n\r\n1. This is Windows terminal with its interpretation  of the different colours and PWSH 7 on Windows has a dark blue background for me PowerShell 5 has traditional blue, Pwsh 6,  cmd and anything linux is black \r\n2. I think the group header block should be same format as the TableHeader \r\n3. I have tried bright white and bold but it is only 242/255  compared with the bright gray for normal being 204/255 which isn't really enough contrast. \r\n4. I tried directories in Normal colour and italic. It gets a \"maybe\" from me it removes the look-at-me look-at-me look-at-me  of having them in inverse, and it does say something is going on.\r\n5. PS1 files formatted as executables makes more more sense to me than all kinds of PowerShell files having a common format. \r\n6. Executables in green but not **BOLD GREEN** turns the attention grabbing down a notch. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 4 things which make me ask if you are **sure** this is ready.\r\n\r\n1. The default colours feeling a bit random. Once they become the norm, changing them will be harder. \r\n2. Not setting the colour of the grouping custom control to match the table headers\r\n3. Using new properties, LengthString and LastWriteTimeString,  but not providing a way to format them (e.g. I would like thousand separators , or might like KB, MB, GB, TB etc), unix-die-hards might want dates to change format depending age as they are used to, \r\n4. Only using the new NameString, LengthString and LastWriteString in table formats. In a perfect world I want formatting OFF for table view and ON for wide view. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@jhoneill the additional asks you have are separate from this feature and something I have planned for the future but separate here means not using the same code as coloring as it's doing different things.  As for the default colors, for directories, if you want italics, you figured out how to customize it for yourself.  The question is what should the defaults be to aid quickly understanding information and also help with discovery of this feature.  `.ps1` and `.bat` (which would also include `.cmd`, `.js.`, .`vbs` as \"executable\") can certainly have the same default color as actual executables and would make sense rather than having PS specific files with a certain color.  That one I can understand.",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT   I don't really think saying apply what you do to names in Table views should also apply to wide views **IS** additional. I think when the ps1xml files were updated - it looks like some is in  `src\\System.Management.Automation\\engine\\TypeTable_Types_Ps1Xml.cs` and some is in `src\\System.Management.Automation\\FormatAndOutput\\DefaultFormatters\\FileSystem_format_ps1xml`  - whoever made the changes was only thinking about the default / table view and didn't finish the job.\r\n\r\nThe  `LengthString` and `LastWriteTimeString`  hidden code properties have been added and they are used in the formatting. If you're saying that having them dormant and adding stuff to PSStyle to light them up is something that needs to come later in order to ship something worthwhile soon, it's a compromise I can live with, provide the intent to do it is there.   \r\n\r\nHeader groups, don't belong to the file experimental feature. It's not clear to me if that should a distinct another setting in PSStyle (my hunch is it should even if the default value matches column headings) and then I think whatever applies formatting to the column headings should apply it.  Probably the smart thing to do on this is to open an issue or a discussion for this one. \r\n\r\nI'm trying to help with the selection of good defaults, but I'm very aware that the way my brain reacts to a printed page or a screen is unusual. I don't want rail too much about how bad directories in inverse text is **for me** if it is helpful to almost everyone else, especially as I can change it. I think we've got to agreement on pwsh files /executables. (I'd use all the extensions in %pathext% + .ps1). \r\n\r\nWhether formatting compressed files adds anything is debatable. One of the things a preview is for is to get feedback on proposed changes to the default experience, so I think at some point you do have to say, \"yes we are sure now.\". That will get more data on how it's received, and how well it works for people. \r\n ",
