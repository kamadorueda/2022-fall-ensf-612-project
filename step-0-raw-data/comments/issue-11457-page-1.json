PowerShell doesn't _create_ a drive named \"E\", it recognizes \"E\" as a system drive.  If you connect Z: to \\\\localhost\\c$  outside PowerShell, it shows up as a PS drive.

Because there isn't a new file system root there is no drive to add. You can make a Windows style drive (so in WSL I can create a PS drive 'C' for /mnt/c ) or one can make a short name for a mounted USB.

The Term \"Drive\" is inherited from  windows as analogous to \"root-of-a-[pseudo]-file-system\" \r\nYour filesystems on those disks are mounted into part of the / \"drive\",  they aren't roots in their own right as they would normally be on Windows.     \r\n\r\nYou **can** create new drives for places in the /  tree   for example\r\n`New-PSDrive -Name C -PSProvider FileSystem -Root /mnt/c`  \r\nWould present a C: drive on pwsh if that is a more convenient way to work.
