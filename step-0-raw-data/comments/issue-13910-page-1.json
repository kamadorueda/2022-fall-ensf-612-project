    "body": "@iSazonov I think that's what you had in mind. I didn't remove the GetEncoding method from Utils because I thought it was still cleaner to have that code outside of the FlushContentToDisk method, but it's greatly simplified. \r\n\r\nI've removed the Encoding property and simply call the GetEncoding method at the start of the FlushContentToDisk, I don't think that should have an impact on performances and I think it's a bit cleaner than opening a file in the setter of a property.\r\n\r\nI decided to open a separate PR from the #13899 because I thought this, while related, is maybe a bit more open for discussion, hope that's OK for you.",
