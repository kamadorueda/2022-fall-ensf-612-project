    "body": "I don't happy with current implementation because (1) it is very perf expensive, (2) it is very limited. \r\n\r\n$PSStyle could not be a const and be _evaluated_ based on host implementation - as result we have no need to filter out escapes because $PSStyle would return $null if user turns off coloring or terminal does not support escapes and so on.\r\n\r\nThis approach has several advantages. First, it doesnâ€™t force users to use escape sequences directly (what would be the worst thing we can imagine), which makes PowerShell very smart. \r\nSecond, it excludes very expensive string operations like filtering.\r\nThirdly, with current implementation PowerShell Engine issues escapes _without testing target terminal capabilities_. In Unix this is resolved with Terminfo database. Our solution should benefit from this too if we do not want to receive an endless number of complaints about poor display on terminals.\r\n\r\nAlso in the PR a consoleless scenario was also mentioned (Windows GUI application). This says that in any case PowerShell Engine _know_ about console and should support any console(less) scenarios. We could consider full decouple from console as a design solution. But then we have to talk about separating PowerShell Formatting System from the engine. We always expect many features from the formatting system itself and they cannot be implemented without integration with the target console / terminal based on some abstraction or virtualization.\r\n\r\nSo I find this approach more flexible and power than static constants and dumb filtering.\r\n",
