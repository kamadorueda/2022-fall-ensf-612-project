    "body": "@malhovic if you look at the Az PowerShell repo, you'll see that they are in progress of having a single `Az` module that works for both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core.  The current AzureRM module only works with Windows PowerShell and similarly, the AzureRM.NetCore module only works with PowerShell Core.  The new `Az` module will resolve this issue.  As suggested by @kilasuit you should follow up in their repo as this is not a PowerShell Core problem we can fix.",
