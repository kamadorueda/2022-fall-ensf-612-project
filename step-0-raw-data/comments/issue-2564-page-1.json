The dependency you're having problems with belongs to .NET Core. The package dependencies are simply those inherited from .NET Core. See if you can reproduce your bug with just C# code using .NET Core, and file an issue with CoreFX.\n",

To gather the package dependencies for PowerShell's packages, the best I could do was manually reconcile with the Ubuntu `dotnet` packages that once existed. I couldn't just say \"depend on `dotnet`\" and have `dotnet` depend on the packages it needs, since they don't _have_ packages; so I pretty much just had to make my best guess. And trust me, I didn't even try to guess for Debian Testing.\n\nThanks for trying our PowerShell!\n",
