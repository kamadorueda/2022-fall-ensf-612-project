And your palindrome example should be\r\n```powershell\r\n-join $s[($s.length-1)..0] -eq $s\r\n```\r\n(You need the `-join` because slices on strings returns character arrays. The unary `-join` glues the characters back into a string.)",

Also remember that ranges are not just used for slices e.g.\r\n```powershell\r\nforeach ($i in 1..10) { $i }\r\n1..10 | foreach { $_ * 2 }\r\n$x = 1..5; $myArray[$x]\r\n```\r\netc. so restricting the hat operator to slices would be a little weird. And `^` as a prefix operator is somewhat problematic since you can have a function named `^` (I did for years). Finally PowerShell already does most of what C# will do but with some strange idiosyncrasies, so I suspect that adding the hat operator now would just add to the confusion. \r\n\r\nGetting back to stepping, my thought had been to simply do, as @vexx32 suggests, `1..10..2`. (Another planned but unimplemented feature from V1 time frame. )\r\n",

A `4..^2` is a true Range type for the same reason, the 4 being implicitly converted to an index type.\r\n\r\nIf we want to allow more versatile uses of Index type items, we could use `5^` for 'from-start' indexes and `^5` for 'from-end' indexes. This would be largely unnecessary, though, as regular integers should be able to be converted to an index value pretty easily as a from-start value in any context where it is needed.",
