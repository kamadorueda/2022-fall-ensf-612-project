Maybe in rare cases you need >256 errors retained to investigate a failure, but that's a manual step, so it's not really a compatibility issue.\n\nSetting `$MaximumErrorCount` is rare (having searched our corpus and GitHub, basically just 1 hit - copied in many scripts. Nothing breaks though, the assignment would create a new variable that isn't used by the engine.\n",
