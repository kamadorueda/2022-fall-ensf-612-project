The pipeline is something like this (pseudo code): \n`Invoke-Pester -PassThrough | Out-NUnitXml | Store-Xml | Parse-NUnitXml | Filter-Failures | Print-Fails` \n\nYou are at the end, looking at the nUnit report in XML. Instead you can tap into the pipeline right after Invoke-Pester. Get the results as a PSObject (`-PassThru`), filter test results to failures with Where, and then either use your print functions, or reuse the internal Pester print functions.\n\n``` powershell\n#store the results in a variable\n$results = invoke-pester -passthru\n\n#get first successful result (you'd do -ne \"Success\")\n$result = $results.TestResult | Where {$_.Result -eq \"Passed\"} | Select -first 1 \n\n#get reference to internal Pester print function\n#(see output.ps1 in Pester, for other output functions)\n$writePesterResult = &(Get-Module Pester) {Get-Command Write-PesterResult}\n\n#print the result \n&$writePesterResult $result\n#outputs:  [+] adds positive numbers 44ms\n```\n\nOr just wait for us to put it directly in Pester. 😃 I just wanted to highlight what is in my opinion a better way to approach this problem.\n",
