    "body": "The linked passage doesn't address what happens when the received data is only _partially consumed_.\r\n\r\nWith the current behavior, you get an all-or-nothing choice:\r\n\r\n* Get _and consume_ ALL output objects currently collected in the job (by default)\r\n\r\n* Get _and keep_ ALL objects currently collected, with `-Keep`\r\n\r\nMy original thought was that `Receive-Job` - without `-Keep` - should only consume those objects that are _actually enumerated (sent through the pipeline)_ - as opposed to removing the entire batch instantly from the job.\r\n\r\n(Someone who then truly wanted the consume-it-all behavior could simply add the `-Wait` switch to the `Select-Object -First` call.)\r\n\r\nThat said, the current behavior is easier to reason about, and questions about how `Select -Last` or `Select -Index` would behave in the partial-consumption scenario do not arise.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTherefore, perhaps the better solution is to introduce a `-First <int>` parameter to `Receive-Object` that allows retrieving a batch of a given size in a consuming manner.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThis dovetails with a _time_-based mechanism of limiting what `Receive-Object` returns, as suggested in #5433.\r\n",
