    "body": "External commands can't throw exceptions. They can only write to the error stream and return an exit code. If the exit code is non-zero then the value of $? will be false. The specific exit code is available in the variable $EXITCODE. Also, you don't need to use Invoke-Expression to execute an external command. You can execute them directly as in\r\n`bash -c \"exit 1\" ; if ( -not $?) { \"Cmd exited with an error status\" }`\r\n(NOTE: In general, Invoke-Expression should be avoided except for a few rare cases since it opens the doors to script injection attacks.)",
