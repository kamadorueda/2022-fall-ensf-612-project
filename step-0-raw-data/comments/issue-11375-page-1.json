    "body": "The problem with resolving everything that starts with a `~` as a path is that you can't pass anything starting with a `~` to an external program. Quoting isn't sufficient to suppress this because you may want to do `~`-expansion in a name with a space in it and that requires quoting the path. The PowerShell workaround (from V1 on) has been to use the `Resolve-Path` command (`rvpa`) to do the expansion as in \r\n```powershell\r\ncode  (rvpa ~\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\profile.ps1) \r\n```\r\nOf course some commands on Windows are smart enough to do their own `~`-expansion like `vim`. For example,\r\n```powershell\r\ngvim  ~\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\profile.ps1\r\n```\r\njust works (one of the reasons `vim` is my favourite text editor :-) ). `code`, however, does not currently do this but it would be nice if it did. In the meantime, you can create you're own wrapper for `code` which calls `rvpa` under the covers.",

Unix users had been living with such restrictions for 35 years and I didn't hear anyone suffered from it.\r\n\r\nand yes, from my point of view it's reasonable enough not to expand quoted strings (again, the same as on Unix). at least, it's better than current behavior. my reasoning is: users usually need `~` completion for short paths, if that involves a space or many letters, they will use tab completion, thus expanding `~`.",
