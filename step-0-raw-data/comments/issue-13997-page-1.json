    "body": "This issue is the precise reason I wrote all of this: #9900 \r\n\r\nCurrently, there is no solution, the pipeline processor simply isn't equipped to handle the scenario by design, there is no \"guaranteed\" execution of any pipeline block. `process{}` blocks can be skipped if a downstream command's `begin{}` block throws an exception, too.\r\n\r\nThe PS team made it fairly clear in multiple issues that `end` was never intended to be a guaranteed execution and they weren't open to changing that.\r\n\r\nThe `cleanup{}` function block implemented in the above PR adds a block that is completely guaranteed to run regardless of errors or otherwise stopping pipelines, but I don't know where the PS team stand on it currently. They have expressed interest multiple times in the past, but it was ready to go well before 7.1 release cycle really started and has received only a few reviews, so I don't know if they're still looking to get it reviewed and accepted. The related RFC was approved, however, so... yeah, I don't know where that's at, it's in limbo as far as I know.",
