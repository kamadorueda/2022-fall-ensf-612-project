    "body": "Glad to hear it, @scotthardwick - if this is green-lighted, it should also be implemented for `Get-Content`, if #11750 gets green-lighted too.\r\n\r\nOn a quick meta note (I hope that's OK - you've indicated that you've only recently started participating here): \r\n\r\n* To show _support_ for a proposal _without further qualification_, it's better to _only_ do a thumbs-up on the original post, to keep the \"signal-to-noise\" ratio down (comments exchanges can get very lengthy, making it hard to come back to an issue later and grasp its gist).\r\n\r\n* By contrast, to voice *opposition* it's better to not only cast a thumbs-down vote, but to complement that with a comment as to _why_, so future readers can weigh the pros and cons.\r\n\r\nGitHub now offers a way to _hide_ one's previous comments after the fact (which is usually preferable to outright _deletion_, so as not to rewrite history), with the ability to choose from a variety of reasons for hiding.\r\n",
