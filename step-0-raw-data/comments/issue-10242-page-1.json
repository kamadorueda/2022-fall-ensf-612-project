It just baffled me that a feature in the NTFS file system wasn't in Powershell. Be it a little known feature that Windows has a version of symbolic links that are **kind of** like Linux symbolic links.  I would have to say if I were to choose an anaogus file to the Windows shortcut it may be the .desktop `desktop entry files` in Linux.\r\n\r\nThank you for informing me to the current updates in Powershell.",
