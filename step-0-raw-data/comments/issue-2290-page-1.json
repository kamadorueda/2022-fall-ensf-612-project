    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT We cannot expect that there is the `file` utility on each Unix system especially on OsX.\r\n\r\nToday I am more deeply researched how `file` utility works. Encoding detection is very simple (yes, file type detection is overkill for us) and can be easily ported to C#. Thus we can easily achieve compliance with the de facto Unix standard. The bad news is that the code is very old and should be brought into line with modern standards (from FSS-UTF (1992) / UTF-8 (1993) to UTF8 (2003)).\r\n\r\nAnother bad news is that this utility does not detect codepages. Do we want to make detection of codepages? If so, do we want high-speed heuristics ([sample](http://www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/intl/UniversalCharsetDetection.html)) or will use simpler but slower ways?\r\n\r\nNow about the conversion. Simple test:\r\n```powershell\r\n[text.encoding]::GetEncodings().count\r\n```\r\nreturn \r\nin Powershell 5.1 - 140 codepages\r\nin Powershell 6.0 (alfa 13) - 8 codepages\r\n(Unix iconv - ~300 codepages)\r\n\r\nShould we completely rely on .Net Core in the expectation that there will be support for multiple charsets? Or should we make our implementation?",
