    "body": "@doctordns I'm not using a \"random\" module. I see the value in having the option to define role capabilities outside of a module, particularly for roles that only restrict built-in cmdlets.\r\n\r\nBut I like the idea of packaging roles with modules when the roles are specific to the module's purpose and its commands. \r\n\r\nPutting them alongside makes sense, especially from the POV of coordination and packaging. If I add new commands to a module, up its version, and publish it, and I want a new role available to make use of them, I'd like that to come along _with_ the module.\r\n\r\nConversely, if I have to define it separately then \r\n1. there's no versioned/packaged format for the standalone directory full of unrelated roles\r\n2. if I put the new role definition in place before the module that supports it, it won't work\r\n3. having to change the session configuration is yet another change and applying it means restarting winrm which is disruptive.\r\n\r\nTrying to implement JEA, which is supported on 5.1, only to find that the entire module-searching that underpins its ability to find roles, doesn't actually support the same module paths that the entire rest of Windows PowerShell uses, is a very bad experience. It's set our project back by a lot. Even if we wanted to dump all the role configurations into a random directory, it would be an entirely different project to get PowerShell 7 out to all our environments and tested with existing workflows.\r\n\r\nI don't think that the role searching idea was problematic, it was just implemented in a way that somehow doesn't work with PowerShell's own package management, which is bonkers. I'm in awe that this has been known for years, and hasn't been fixed and backported.",
