I am not certain whether there is an official documentation for this behavior, but below is what I found:\r\n\r\n* According to wikipedia, environment variable was introduced [by Version 7 Unix in 1979, and all subsequent variants, as well as DOS since 1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) has this capability.\r\n* As we all know, environment variables are passed into processes as part of its invocation. Captured in the same wikipedia page is [a quote that says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable#Design):\r\n  > Alternatively, from command shells such as bash, a user can change environment variables for a particular command invocation by indirectly invoking it via `env` or using the `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=VALUE <command>` notation.\r\n* from there we can infer that this is a capability that belongs to the individual shells. Looking up [bash's documentation, we found the following](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#Environment):\r\n  > The environment for any simple command or function may be augmented temporarily by prefixing it with parameter assignments, as described in Shell Parameters. These assignment statements affect only the environment seen by that command.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, my interpretation is that the `ENV_VAR1=<val1> ENV_VAR2=<val2> <cmd ...>` is a syntax that bash can specifically parse, so that the current environment variables are augmented with `ENV_VAR1` and `ENV_VAR2` to be passed to `cmd ...`, so that once parsed, the `ENV_VAR1` and `ENV_VAR2` aren't part of the command, and thus not captured in the process table.\r\n\r\nHope this helps, let me know if there are any questions thanks.",

It's things like these that make it feel clumsy and it seems (based on what @iSazonov said) that attempts to improve it meet too much friction. Hence, the question \"do you use your own shell\".\r\n\r\nSo no, I'm not submitting a PR, because I simply don't care enough to fix someone else's product that I infrequently use. I'm simply bumping the tracker in hopes that the ergonomics of PS improve over time.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov: Where did you get stuck? What's left? I couldn't find the branch in your (most recent) PS fork.",
