    "body": "Just following up, this is very similar to #10188, but it's not exactly the same in my opinion. Here's why:\r\n\r\n* The default parameter set in `Get-Command` is `CmdletSet`.\r\n* The `Name` parameter in `Get-Command` accepts pipeline input by value and by property name, and belongs to the `AllCommandSet` parameter set (i.e. not the default one).\r\n* The `Module` parameter in `Get-Command` accepts pipeline input by property name and is in all parameter sets.\r\n\r\nWhen you invoke `@{Module = 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility'} | Get-Command` (a pithy equivalent of the example used in the OP), you're passing in a PSObject with only a `Module` property on it. Since `Module` is a parameter that accepts pipeline input by value on any parameter set, logic seems to indicate that PowerShell should bind it to that parameter, but it does not. Instead, I think the logic goes more like this in this particular case:\r\n\r\n- since the parameter being piped into does not have any parameters in the invocation that can uniquely tie it to a specific parameter set, look at the pipeline input by itself and see if it can do something with the default parameter set\r\n- while looking at the default parameter set, since the command accepts pipeline input by value into a string parameter, it just converts the input into string and doesn't look any further (this is the logic that I believe is flawed in this case)\r\n\r\nThe end result is that the incoming object is converted into a string and bound to `Name`, which is the wrong thing to do. Parameter binding with pipeline input really needs to use a best match algorithm that considers all possibilities and matches to the best non-ambiguous one.\r\n\r\nRegardless, there is a risk of a breaking change here as well if any of this behavior is changed, whether the current implementation is illogical or not.\r\n",
