    "body": "Looks like Bash is intercepting `C-L` as designed and issuing a native `clear` command. If you issue `clear` directly to PowerShell, its is correctly aliased to native `clear` and behaves as excepted. PowerShell's host does not currently intercept `C-L`.\n\nThis is not a bug, and is expected behavior. Improving this behavior is the purview of PSReadLine, not our current project.\n",
