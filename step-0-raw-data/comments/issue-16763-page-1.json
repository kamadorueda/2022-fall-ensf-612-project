    "body": "Looks like this is an unintended consequence of https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Native/pull/70. The fact that it appears on your interactive desktop would indicate you also have `-EnableNetworkAccess` are you able to confirm that by checking `$PSDefaultParameterValues`? I'm only able to replicate it myself with `-EnableNetworkAccess` and not without.\r\n\r\nThe reason why this is happening is because `-EnableNetworkAccess` will spawn the `wsmprovhost.exe` process on the session the WinRM plugin is starting on. Without `-EnableNetworkAccess` the session used to spawn the remote process is session 0 which is hidden from the user but when you set `-EnableNetworkAccess` it will spawn it on the same interactive session as the caller as it's using the same access token for network access. Since the PR mentioned it will also now explicitly call `AllocConsole` to spawn a new console and because it's in the same session as the caller this console appears in the form of a new conhost that is blank.\r\n\r\nThis essentially means that we either need to\r\n\r\n* Revert the change\r\n  * Simplest option but brings back the problem https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/15128\r\n* Don't create the console if not on session 0\r\n  * Would require a check on the access token to see what session it is in and conditionally spawn the console if in session 0\r\n  * This means the issue above will affect `-EnableNetworkAccess` sessions but normal ones are still unaffected\r\n* Explicitly hide the console\r\n  * Simplest method will result in a flash on the screen when the conhost appears when allocated but before it is hidden\r\n  * A more complex method to avoid this flash is to call `CreateProcess` to spawn a new console app (like `cmd.exe` in a hidden state) and attach that hidden console to `wsmprovhost.exe`\r\n  * The latter has performance implications as now a new connection needs to start up an extra process\r\n* Do nothing\r\n  * AFAIK this will only affect `-EnableNetworkAccess` and cannot see how it could affect anything else as they would all be spawned in session 0\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT @PaulHigin do you have any thoughts on the matter? Personally I think the console should be explicitly hidden and I don't really think we should go out of our way to avoid the flash due to the limited use case where it will appear.",

    "body": "> I felt it worth weighing in on this since the Do nothing option would break functionality in our product's usage.\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing your use case, I personally don't think it's a viable option as there are some nice low hanging fruit to try and reduce the impact here.\r\n\r\nOne question I do, is there a reason why you are using `-EnableNetworkAccess` at all? This essentially uses the WSMan API to spawn a process using the same access token as the caller. You can achieve the same thing with a `NamedPipeConnectionInfo` or even just a new Runspace in a separate thread. Jobs are also essentially the same thing but might be a bit hard if you are relying on the `Invoke-Command`/`Enter-PSSession` interfaces.\r\n\r\n> Having read through the #15128 and understanding as much of it as I could without a deep dive, I wonder if there's a more elegant solution to solve this, considering that 'EnableNetworkAccess' isn't even present in the linked comments.\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution IIRC was to try and fix .NET so that `Console.OutputEncoding` looked up the value but there's no real way of doing this without first spawning the console anyway. I personally see 3 viable options here (in no particular order and really juse psuedo code)\r\n\r\n### Option 1 - Hide the Console After Spawning\r\n\r\n```c\r\nAllocConsole();\r\nShowWindow(GetConsoleWindow(), SW_HIDE);\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly downside here is that there will still be a flash that occurs after it is spawned but before it is hidden. Advantages is that it's very simple and doesn't have much of an overhead.\r\n\r\n### Option 2 - Hide the Console Before Spawning\r\n\r\n```c\r\nSTARTUPINFO startupInfo;\r\nstartupInfo.cb = sizeof(startupInfo);\r\nstartupInfo.dwFlags = STARTF_USESHOWWINDOW;\r\nstartupInfo.wShowWindow = SW_HIDE;\r\n\r\nPROCESS_INFORMATION processInfo;\r\n\r\nif (CreateProcess(NULL, \"cmd.exe\", NULL, NULL, FALSE, \r\n    CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, NULL, NULL, &startupInfo, &processInfo))\r\n{\r\n    AttachConsole(processInfo.dwProcessId);\r\n    TerminateProcess(processInfo.hProcess, 0);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis spawns a new console app (`cmd.exe` in this case) that is hidden and then attaches it's console to the `wsmprovhost` process. The Advantages here is that there shouldn't be any flash as it is spawned as a hidden window but the disadvantage is that there's now the overhead of spawning cmd everytime a new connection is made.\r\n\r\n### Option 3 - Do not spawn a console for -EnableNetworkAccess\r\n\r\n```c\r\nHANDLE token\r\nDWORD length = 0;\r\nDWORD sessionId = 0;\r\n\r\nOpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_QUERY, &token);\r\nif (GetTokenInformation(token, TokenSessionId, &sessionId, sizeof(sessionId), &length))\r\n{\r\n    if (sessionId == 0)\r\n    {\r\n        AllocConsole();\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis only spawns the console when running in session 0 (not `-EnableNetworkAccess`). Advantages is that it solves the original issue it tried to fix but the disadvantage is now `-EnableNetworkAccess` suffers from that same problem when processing non-ASCII output from native applications.\r\n\r\n@tbakerweb do you find option 1 (with the brief flash) an acceptable middle ground here?",

It could add some heuristics to try and find the correct default but even then that's not a guarantee it will be correct, you essentially need to have a console attached to get the actual value.
