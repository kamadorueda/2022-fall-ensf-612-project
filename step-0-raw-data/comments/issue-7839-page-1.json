However, the wait produces its own problems - see #4594.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Note that derived types will work, just disparate types won't be displayed.  As noted by @mklement0 I'm open to a RFC to propose a solution on how to handle this.  Consider if you have an array of a,a,b,a,b,a where [a] and [b] are different types.  How would these be displayed?  Should they be grouped by type and then displayed or interleave different tables which makes it hard to read.  Of course grouping means that it would have to capture all the output before it can start rendering or cache all objects not the same as the first type which can use lots of memory.",
