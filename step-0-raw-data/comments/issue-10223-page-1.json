It is more user friendly than generic parser error message.\r\n\r\nI'm confused @iSazonov, because that seems to contradict what was said in #9570, where the discussion suggests removing them entirely, unless I read it wrong. In that discussion, @SteveL-MSFT said the following:\r\n\r\n> Part of the reasoning by @PowerShell/powershell-committee to remove is to have the errors at parse time/compile time (for C# code) vs at runtime. There is no plan to ever bring back workflow.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a difference between the `parallel` block statement (which was solely a workflow construct) and the `-parallel` and `-throttlelimit` (which doesn't appear to be documented btw) parameters on `foreach` that only worked inside of a workflow. The `parallel` and `sequence` block statements are workflow-only, and that has been deprecated, so I believe they should remain removed as per the quote above.\r\n\r\nAs for foreach and `-parallel`, that RFC was removed in favor of `ForEach-Object -parallel`. Do we want a parseable foreach parameter that doesn't work because someday it might be in the foreach statement, or do we want parser errors to catch that it doesn't work, knowing we can implement parallelism support in the foreach keyword if/when we decide to do so, using whatever syntax we want at the time. I prefer the latter. Placeholders are only indicators of how long it actually takes before you do something, and since this is a keyword, there's no risk of conflict with 3rd party extensions, so better to have it result in a parser error as long as it won't work if you ask me.",

The PowerShellGet update should simply check the PowerShell version, and only use the `IsWorkflow` property if the PS Version is less than 7. That will allow it to continue to be updated and work across all versions.",
