The root problem is that using '.'  this way is inherently fragile. What do you do if your XML has a `Count` property? We certainly can't hide that.  Now in this specific example, you can work around the `Address` property issue by using the `foreach` method as in:\r\n```powershell\r\n([xml]'<root>\r\n<user><address>huddledmasses.org</address><anything/></user>\r\n<user><address>github.com</address><else/></user>\r\n</root>').root.user.foreach('address')\r\n```\r\nBut that is still a bit clunky. An optimal solution would be to have another operator that only looks at the content, never at the container. This was proposed in #7445.\r\n",

Hashtables have a similar problem, where if you define a `Keys` or `Count` or similar _key_ in a hashtable, the properties of the container become inaccessible.\r\n\r\nI think that if we introduce a new operator to access the content specifically, hashtables should be reworked as well to avoid the frankly irritating workarounds (e.g., code like [this](https://github.com/vexx32/PSWordCloud/blob/7dc82bf7bd36477c5782c156f5fcd570d69f76de/PSWordCloud/Public/New-WordCloud.ps1#L414)). (Especially since hashtables already _have_ a perfectly serviceable method of accessing keys.\r\n\r\nWhich begs the question, I suppose; could we co-opt the hashtable/array syntax for this purpose here as well?",

    "body": "@BrucePay I can see your point about hiding the member, the problem is that it's actually really hard to figure out where the thing came from. It's an **ugly** surprise.\r\n\r\nAn explicit unrolling operator would be a workaround, but it has the same problem as .foreach: it's not discoverable at all -- and I have no way of knowing that I need it! \r\n\r\nWhen I type:  `$doc` I see a \"root\" property, so I type `$doc.root` and I see a \"user\" so I type `$doc.root.user` and I see the address _property_ ...  There's no way for me to know there's a landmine. It doesn't even show up when you pipe the `$doc.root.user | get-member -force` ... \r\n\r\nAnd then, to add insult to injury, the `Address` _method_ isn't callable in PowerShell, at all.\r\n\r\nOf course, the `Address` method is on `[System.Object[]]` which I shouldn't really be dealing with in XML land anyway. Logically speaking this **ought** to be a `System.Xml.XmlElementList` or a `System.Xml.XPathNodeList` or one of those other .NET 1.0 era XML custom collection objects...\r\n",
