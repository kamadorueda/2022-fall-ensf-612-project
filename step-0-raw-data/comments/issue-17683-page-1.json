Why? If `\"$null\" -eq \"\"`, outputting an array containing `\"$null\"` **or** `\"\"` should result in the same. But it doesn't. Array values of `\"\"` result in empty lines, whereas array values of `\"$null\"` result in nothing.\r\nThis doesn't make sense. The fact that lines are broken, i.e. an array value per line is output, is the behavior of outputting an array. It should have nothing to do with the value of the respective array item. The value of an array item should only define the content of the line, but not the fact that a line is output.\r\n\r\nOf course I do understand the compatibility / breaking change related considerations. Still, I think such inconsistency in behavior should also be considered to get fixed in the long run, in order to prevent people falling into (unecessary) traps.",
