Instead, the user just gets things randomly not working or partially supported. \r\n\r\nFrankly, this is a CoreFX stability problem that bubbles up to the web cmdlets. If we have to go look at the low-level ourselves to correct around CoreFX's stability problems, that leaves us with either rolling our own solution (which is a huge mess), providing an inconsistent user experience (bad UX), or removing the features on macOS until there is some kind of stability in CoreFX.",
