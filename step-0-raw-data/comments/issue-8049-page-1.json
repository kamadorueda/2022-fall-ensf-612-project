Basically, the current implementation is incredibly clunky.\r\n\r\nI'd very much like if we could simply include dynamicparam as *part of* the `param()` block, perhaps as a full script block expression in place of a the typical `[attributes()]$variable`\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam(\r\n    [switch]\r\n    $Param1,\r\n\r\n    [DynamicParameter] {\r\n        if ($Param1) { \r\n            [Parameter(Mandatory)]\r\n            $Param2 = { Default-Value }\r\n        }\r\n        else { \r\n            [Parameter()]\r\n            $Param3 = \"Default Value\"\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    [switch]\r\n    $Param3\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo summarise &mdash; Idea, absolutely, needs some love.
