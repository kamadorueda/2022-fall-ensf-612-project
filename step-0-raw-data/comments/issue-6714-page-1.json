Since it was the shell that did expansion, commands had no control of it and the user had to do explicit quoting. Quoting wildcards in paths in PowerShell is problematic since the expansion is handled in the API, not the shell directly and so you have to double-quote all wildcards. This was such a pain we ended up adding `-LiteralPath` in V2 (not my favourite thing)\r\n \r\n\r\n",
