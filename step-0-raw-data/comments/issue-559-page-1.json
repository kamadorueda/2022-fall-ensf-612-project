Move start of native executable from pipeline `Complete()` method (executes at the time of `end` block) to `Prepare()` method (executes at the time of `begin` block). This is prototyped in https://github.com/vors/PowerShell/tree/native-pipe\n2. Combine sequential native pipline elements and treat them as one pipeline element. Link them with IO redirection directly instead of powershell pipeline.\n\nTogether these two changes will cover simple scenarios:\n- `native | native`\n- `ps | native`\n\nUnfortunately `native | ps` and more complicated scenarios, like `ps | native | ps`, will still be sub-optimal. I'm looking forward for propositions to address them.\n",
