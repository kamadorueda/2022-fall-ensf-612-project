    "body": "@JohnLBevan Your assuming that the first object has all the properties. That is not true in many cases. Each item in an object can have it's own set of properties as @iSazonov mentions above. So if you only check for the first item in the object, you lose properties if it wasn't specified in the first object.\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say that you have an object of people's names. You have First, Middle, Last, Suffix. First and Last is likely to be populated most of the time. However, Middle and Suffix are less reliable. Some people populate Middle, others don't and not everyone has a Suffix to their name. Let's represent this in PowerShell.\r\n\r\n````PowerShell\r\n$inputObject = @(\r\n   [PSCustomObject] @{ First=\"William\"; \"Last=\"Riker\" }\r\n   [PSCustomObject] @{ First=\"Robert\"; Last=\"Downy\"; Suffix=\"Jr.\" }\r\n   [PSCustomObject] @{ First=\"Sarah\"; Middle=\"Jessica\"; Last=\"Parker\" }\r\n)\r\n````\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the object we are accustomed to is really an array of hash tables cast as PSCustomObjects, with each having their own properties. This is very common when pulling data from APIs and Excel into PowerShell. \r\n\r\nPowerShell also uses heuristics to combine all Output and figure out the properties to output to you in Format-Table and Format-List, as well as Get-Member. The less used properties may not be found and displayed by default. \r\n\r\nYour not going to lose anything in trying to process the properties in a Process block, that is it's intended purpose. You need to go through each item to get the individual object and handle it anyway.\r\n\r\nBTW, I've actually ran into this recently with Get-Member not accurately giving me all properties when I was trying to compare properties of two objects and only get the unique columns. I had to loop through all objects to most accurately get the properties to prevent bugs.\r\n\r\nWhere Begin and End blocks become truly useful is when you think of how to read a DataReader object across multiple cmdlets in a pipeline....",
