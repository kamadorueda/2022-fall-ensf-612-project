    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT I had some further discussions with @jpsnover. Basically EndProcessing isn't called if there is an exception because it's not a destructor. EndProcessing is just part of the normal processing. Consider a counter function `function count {begin {$c=0} process {$c++} end {$c}}` . An exception should terminate function execution not resume execution at `end`.  If it ran `end` then whatever was in `$c` would be incorrectly emitted to the pipeline. As far as clean-up goes, for compiled cmdlets, we call `Dispose` on the cmdlet which allows for clean-up. For scripts, we don't expose `Dispose` in a useful way so perhaps we should add a \"cleanup { }\" block for functions  scripts. (IIRC our thinking wrt scripts was that scripts call cmdlets and cmdlets get disposed therefore most things in a script will be disposed. Things that don't get disposed that way will eventually be disposed by the garbage collector/finalizer q.e.d there was no need for a cleanup block.)",

    "body": "@aetos382 This is a slightly different scenario where a resource _internal to the command_ is opened in `Begin`, used in `Process` and then closed in `End`. A `using`-style statement isn't applicable since there are three separate blocks and you don't want to dispose the resource when a block completes, only when _all_ blocks have completed.   Now you could wrap each of the blocks in a `try/catch` statement\r\n```\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n      ... do stuff with resource....\r\n}\r\ncatch {\r\n      ... close the resource\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNote that you want to use `catch` instead of `finally` because you only want to close the resource if there's an exception. In the normal flow, the resource would be released in the `end` block.\r\n\r\nWRT the `finally {}` cmdlet block @SteveL-MSFT, proposes, I expect that it would be run when the command is disposed by the pipeline processor. (Consequently, one might argue that it should be called `Dispose` instead of `Finally`. Another name might be `trap { }` in which case we would have to think about  `break` and `continue`  semantics.\r\n \r\n\r\n",

It seems to be robust to downstream `throw`, `break`, `continue`, `$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError()`, and Ctrl-C.  Usage is described in [the `usingObject {}` section of this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/49141823/1404637). \r\n\r\n There's also a variant I've been calling `Afterward {}` that can be used to perform arbitrary cleanup from a scriptblock for things that don't implement `IDisposable`.\r\n\r\nI don't mean to dissuade language support for this sort of thing.  Rather, I'd like to suggest that whatever language support is added should probably be an improvement over what is already possible with a library function and design pattern.\r\n",

    "body": "@alx9r This scenario is for when a resource _internal_ to the command is opened in `Begin`, used in `Process` and then closed in `End`. The resource is not externally visible so you can't use a `using-object` approach to wrap the command from the outside. From the inside, you'd have to wrap the code inside each block introducing another scriptblock dispatch for every begin/process/end call which is significant overhead. Having a `Dispose` block is just simpler and more efficient. That said, having a `Using-Object` cmdlet is clearly a good idea that we just never got around to. Perhaps you can open a separate issue to track adding this? Thanks.",

There area many modules out there where the session state is handled inside the module that exports the command the user is calling.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Foo {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param ()\r\n    \r\n    begin {\r\n        Connect-Foo\r\n    }\r\n    process {\r\n        <# doo stuff with foo #>\r\n    }\r\n    end {\r\n        Disconnect-Foo\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that case, there is no object to dispose but the connection still lingers if an exception kills the pipeline.\r\n\r\n@BrucePay That's what I was thinking. The `End {}` block would become a place for completing `Process {}` operations (for example, when the pipeline is collected to perform operations such as measure) and the `Dispose {}` block would become the de facto place to close connections and perform cleanup as its ensured to run. \r\n\r\nWhat is not clear to me is how to handle output and errors from the `Dispose {}`. I'm inclined to think output in the `Dispose {}` block should be ignored (similar to how PowerShell Class methods are not leaky). I definitely don't think the output from this block should sent to the output stream, but I'm sure this will cause confusion. I'm also certain users will want to be able to collect output from this block somehow. Perhaps a `-DisposeVariable` common parameter could be added to allow for collection of output from the `Dispose {}` block, similar to `-OutVariable`. And, I'm not sure if Errors/exceptions in the Dispose block should be populated in `-ErrorVariable`.\r\n",

I think the correct question to ask is - is another pattern needed **if** PowerShell had clean support for disposable objects?\r\n\r\nThe right answer might be - you need two things - better disposable support **and** a way to register arbitrary cleanup code - this would be analogous to C# `using` and `finally` statements.",

    "body": "@lzybkr That's a fair point.\r\n\r\nI think that given the history, the pattern of not returning Disposable objects will continue and it would certainly persist in older code. I can update my code to make use of disposable objects, but I may not be able to update someone else's code I depend on. I'd be left with same situation if only better support for disposable objects was added.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of adding a new pattern would be the ability to wrap 3rd party code. I suppose that could still be done by warping 3rd party functions in PowerShell classes that implement IDisposable. However, my experience is that the majority of PowerShell users are not comfortable with or interested in using PowerShell classes. (I make it a habit to ask if people are using classes, why/why not, and what for). I suspect the comfort level with a `Dispose {}` would be higher, but that is just my guess.\r\n\r\nI agree, though, it probably does need both.",

Using @lzybkr's hypothetical `[Dispose()]`, for example:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfunction foo {\r\n    [Dispose()]$v = Get-Connect # what if .Stop() is invoked during this call?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs `Get-Connect`'s execution allowed to continue on `.Stop()` until the assignment is complete?  I _think_ the repro in #7155 demonstrates that, currently, an unfortunately-timed `.Stop()` can allow resources to be allocated without the scope that would do the cleanup ever getting a handle to it.  Could that be overcome by `[Dispose()]` too?",

    "body": "I believe that addressing this would be extremely valuable.  IMHO it is one of the roughest edges on the language and I don't believe a real solution is possible without language support.  \r\n\r\nEven trying to explain all of the considerations involved to someone without a fairly deep knowledge of PowerShell is quite difficult.  Experienced C# developers often struggle just as much as beginners with little programming experience because you have to think about all of the ways a function might stop executing, terminating vs. non-terminating errors, etc.\r\n\r\nI'd vote for a new named scriptblock that was guaranteed to execute regardless of how the command stopped.  I could imagine some kind of defer-like thing where you pushed scriptblocks onto a stack as a solution, but that seems more race-y, verbose and error prone.\r\n\r\nI'd also love some using-like sugar to cut down on the boilerplate involved in handling cleanup in general (even worse with strict mode on), but that is something that might be doable without explicit language support.\r\n\r\nOne scenario that I don't think has been explicitly called out is a desire to do conditional cleanup.  In many cases, I want to have a \"convenience\" ParameterSet that takes something like a computername or a path and an \"optimized\" ParameterSet that takes some existing connection/handle/thing that requires cleanup.  In the convenience case, it's the function's responsibility to create the necessary disposable and then deterministically clean it up when it's done.  In the optimized case, the function does not take ownership of the disposable, it just uses it and is expected to leave it open.  The convenience set is for use in a shell or one-shot operations, the optimized path is used to amortize the setup cost for the disposable in more complex scenarios where it might be used for multiple things.\r\n\r\nSome of the suggestions (like an attribute) seem less compatible with this scenario.  Here's a contrived  example, don't read too much into this being a CimSession:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Get-Example {\r\n    [CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSetName = 'ByComputerName')]\r\n    param(\r\n        [Parameter(Position = 0, ParameterSetName = 'ByComputerName')]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $ComputerName = $env:ComputerName,\r\n\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory = $true, ParameterSetName = 'ByCimSession')]\r\n        [CimSession]\r\n        $CimSession\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    try {\r\n        # Normalize things so the rest of the body can assume/work with $CimSession \r\n        if ($PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName -eq 'ByComputerName') {\r\n            $CimSession = New-CimSession -ComputerName $ComputerName -ErrorAction Stop\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem -CimSession $CimSession\r\n    }\r\n    catch {\r\n        # Using a catch as a glorified goto to handle a terminating error initializing the CimSession\r\n        Write-Error -ErrorRecord $_\r\n    }\r\n    finally {\r\n        # If we \"own\" the CimSession, clean it up.\r\n        if ($CimSession -and $PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName -ne 'ByCimSession') {\r\n            Remove-CimSession -CimSession $CimSession\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",

It would also allow the author to handle normal post processing and a stopped cmdlet differently.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but your recommendation is to have the `finally` block in a `try/catch` get executed even though the cmdlet is told stop. If that assumption is correct I believe that would require the connection to be built and torn down on each pipeline object creating unnecessary overhead. It would remove the ability to have the connection created in the `begin` block. Interact with the resource one or many times in the `process` block. Then close the connection in the `end` block.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Foo {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param ()\r\n\r\n    begin { }\r\n    process {\r\n        try {\r\n            # open connection\r\n            # interact with resource\r\n        }\r\n        catch {\r\n            # do something\r\n        }\r\n        finally {\r\n            # gets called even if cmdlet is stopped\r\n            # close connection\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    end { }\r\n}\r\n```",

If you did, for example by calling Write-Verbose, a) it would throw, b) if it were fixed to just be ignored, it would be unexpected (you can already envision the Issues that would be filed: \"`Write-Verbose` inexplicably does nothing when called from StopProcessing\"). So your shared function would have to have a switch to enable `StopProcessing`-safe operation... which seems terrible, given that the shared function might want to call other shared functions, etc., until you've poisoned whole libraries.\r\n\r\nIn production code that I've written where I really, really needed to be able to properly handle cancellation and cleanup, I went to the length of using C# and P/Invoke to intercept <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>c</kbd> signals and completely handled cancellation myself (the limitations of `StopProcessing` were too onerous for me).\r\n",

    "body": "~~This was called out very early in the thread, but regarding [this comment from earlier on this thread](#issuecomment-382478291), is `Dispose` the right name to use here?~~\r\n\r\n~~For some people, the `Dispose` name might imply that the script block would be run with garbage collection. In C#, `Dispose` methods are automatically invoked as part of garbage collection, or manually if you don't want to wait. In PowerShell, the `Dispose` block would be automatically invoked on command completion, never manually, and never as part of garbage collection. Would that inconsistency cause some confusion? Maybe not, but coming from C#, that name originally made me wonder how to invoke it manually if I didn't want to wait for garbage collection, which made me wonder if it would cause confusion for users going from PowerShell to C# as well.~~\r\n\r\n~~Using `Dispose` also means that the new parameter name added to ForEach-Object to provide the same functionality would be named `DisposeScript` instead of just `Dispose`, since you cannot create a property with the same name as a method in the underlying C# class (although it would be possible to extend the Parameter attribute to allow for a name that is different than the underlying property name if it was wanted badly enough). Regardless, that's not a huge issue, but I wanted to mention it here.~~\r\n\r\n~~I don't have a great alternative name, but I wanted to ask the question to avoid potential confusion with C#'s Dispose method anyway.~~\r\n\r\n~~A few of the names we tossed around when discussing this on Slack are: `Cleanup`, `Finalize` (could be confused with `finally`), `Close` (but there is no `Open`).~~",

They did not want to rely on non-deterministic garbage collection.  \r\n\r\nI think the confusion about this arises because both the `IDisposable.Dispose()` method and a type's finalizer typically call a shared bit of code with the name/sig `Dispose(bool disposing)`.

Some operations are safe to cancel; cancelling others may cause memory leaks, unstable behaviour, or lead to the shell crashing completely.\r\n\r\n_That_ is why a dispose{} block is needed in the first place; without it, script module authors have to accept that their code may at any time become unstable, or find obscure and complicated workarounds to ensure that users can't cancel critical cleanup operations.\r\n\r\nSome operations are safe to cancel, others... may result in instability. 🙂 ",

If that's the case, there's no solution.  The only place that a extra \"really cancel\" function would do anything positive is if the writer was explicitly running an infinite loop in `dispose` for some reason.  In all other cases it's just a race condition that will occasionally leave resources open to save a few milliseconds.",
