    "body": "Currently the engine isn't very smart about casting *to* interfaces.  It's not that big of a deal for `IDictionary`, but before interfaces are recommended that should probably be solved.\r\n\r\nThis is more often a problem when it comes to `IEnumerable<T>` and `IList<T>`. PowerShell knows how to cast `object[]` to `int[]`, and it knows that `int[]` is `IEnumerable<int>`, but it doesn't know how to cast `object[]` to `IEnumerable<int>`.  Admittedly, that's not an easy problem to solve, but I do think it's worth it (even if that just means hard coding conversion paths for common interfaces like `IEnumerable<>` and `IDictionary`).",

    "body": "I think it's fine to already start recommending use of `IDictionary` specifically, given that it is both a common use case and works as intended - though better support such as `object[]` to `IEnumerable<int>` casts would certainly be nice.\r\n\r\nI think the challenges of interface use in PowerShell are primarily _conceptual_:\r\n\r\n* User usually don't have to deal with interfaces directly, given that PowerShell surfaces even explicit interface implementations as direct object members, and less experienced users may even be unaware of the concept of interfaces altogether.\r\n\r\n  * This means that when they see interface-based parameter declarations (e.g., `IDictionary` for `New-Object`'s `-Property` parameter), they need to either rely on the parameter _description_ to know what concrete types to pass or rely on their own advanced .NET knowledge, including knowing how to inspect a given type (instance) for implementing the target interface.\r\n\r\n* Script authors, especially those with a C# background, need to be aware that PowerShell generally _ignores_ casts to interfaces and base classes and that such casts matter only for .NET method overload resolution and during PowerShell function/script parameter binding, but even in the latter case what the script / function sees as the parameter _variable_ is the _original type_.\r\n\r\n  * In other words: in PowerShell, you never interact with an interface _directly_, only with an implementing type's implementations of its members, which means that inside a script with an interface-typed parameter you need to be aware of what members are truly the interface's, as only they can be relied on.\r\n\r\nIn addition to documentation, the following would also help:\r\n\r\nThe ability to inspect a given instance or type for the interfaces it implements as well as their members - see #13865\r\n",
