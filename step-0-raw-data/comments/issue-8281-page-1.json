This would be just applying how we talk about these things to the actual code we write.\r\n\r\n### Alternative\r\n\r\nDrop the dots, i.e. instead of using `S.M.A.` as the prefix, use `SMA.`, and so on.

If we wanted to use a more explicit alias like `PSAutomation` or some such for this shortcut, I think that may also be worth considering.\r\n\r\nI think we need to balance clarity of intent with the need to shorten that namespace length, and attempt to avoid causing unnecessarily avoidable collisions where we can here.",

On the contrary. `Automation` is much more likely to be used as a namespace name already than `S.M.A`.\r\n\r\nI had also considered simply using `PS` or the `PS` prefix for the `System.Management.Automation` shortcut, but I don't like the shortcut being that far from the original name. With PowerShell already supporting pithy names in many cases, the `S.M.A.*.` approach fits. It also fits with the recent proposals on how to handle Intellisense with camel case command names.\r\n\r\nThe goal I'm trying to reach here is worthy of a solution: make working with overly verbose, native, common PowerShell types in PowerShell much easier by default, so that you get easy access to those types whether you're using PowerShell ad hoc or in a script.\r\n\r\nMy preference is still for automatic using (as proposed at the top of this issue), but if the PS team doesn't feel that's acceptable, what alternative do they propose?",
