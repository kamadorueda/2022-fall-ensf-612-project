I'm currently using PowerShell 6.1.0-preview.4 on Ubuntu 18.04 and `code` seems to work -- which suggests that this bug might be fixed in the preview release. Do you want to install the preview and try that? (Should be available with `sudo apt install powershell-preview` if you have the repositories installed)",

I'm running two different machines with Ubuntu 18.04.1 LTS and can't reproduce this issue on either.\r\n\r\nA few possibilities to check:\r\n- VSCode isn't being opened *behind* the terminal (sounds silly, but [it's been an issue before](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/410#issuecomment-397531817))\r\n- VSCode isn't somehow aliased or anything (unlikely but easy to check with `code --version`)\r\n- VSCode might be crashing, which can be checked with `code --verbose`\r\n- VSCode thinks it has a window open already, which can be avoided with `code -n`\r\n- Also might be worth seeing what happens with `code --wait --verbose` to see if VSCode blocks or not\r\n\r\nI know those are all VSCode things and clearly this is working in `bash`, but easy enough to check.\r\n\r\nThe other question I suppose is whether your PowerShell can launch other GUI apps, like:\r\n  - A generic built-in Ubuntu app or something with a native implementation like the Telegram or Signal clients\r\n  - Another Electron app or perhaps a browser like Spotify or Chromium\r\n  - VSCode Insiders\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm assuming so far that you're using the Ubuntu GNOME 3 shell, rather than KDE or MATE or i3 or something else.",
