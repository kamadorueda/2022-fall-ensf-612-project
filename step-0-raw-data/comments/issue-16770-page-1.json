So it:\r\n* Doesn't treat \",\" as a separator between items and requires multiple items as separate inputs\r\n* Doesn't process Variables  - `$PsversionTable` will be the literal text starting with a `$` sign not the value of the variable\r\n* Doesn't need quotes where there are spaces and treats quotes and escape characters as literal text. \r\n* Doesn't have any of the functionality provided by the prompt (and in modern versions by PS Readline).  So  `[ctrl]`+`r`  is not search-history but inserts `^R\" \r\n* Doesn't add to the search history\r\n\r\n ",
