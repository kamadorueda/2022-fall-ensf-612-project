With WinCompat enabled, module is getting loaded and that generates the warning.\r\nIt is an interesting side discussion: why starting a job is supposed to autoload a module that user never wanted to load.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in original post, experimental feature can be disabled to prevent this; also WinCompat RFC discusses more narrow 'wincompat module blacklist' mechanism, feel free to provide your opinion on this.\r\n",
