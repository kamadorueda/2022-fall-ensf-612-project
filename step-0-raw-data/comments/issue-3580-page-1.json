    "body": "This probably is not the right fix, what if I'm starting an application which is not powershell and I really would like no environment variable at all?\r\n\r\nI feel the right approach probably should be avoiding using environment variables in powershell as much as possible. After we move to `netcoreapp2.0`, we can use `[System.Environment]::GetFolderPath` to get most special folder paths on windows. For example, `ClrFacade.GetFileSecurityZone` uses `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(\"SystemRoot\")` which can be replaced now. It seems `PSReadline` also depends on environment variables and thus I got the error `The type initializer for 'Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine`.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's impossible to avoid environment variables in powershell on Unix, as `[System.Environment]::GetFolderPath` doesn't work in most cases. So I believe powershell started by `Start-Process powershell -UseNewEnvironment` on Unix platforms won't work well by design.",
