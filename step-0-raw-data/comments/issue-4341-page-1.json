    "body": "Can I suggest that you change the title of your issue to reflect the fact that you're looking for PowerShell to introduce a _profile-independent_ way to _persistently_ define environment variables?\r\n\r\nA few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* Environment variables are by definition _shell/application-agnostic_ and are seen by _all_ descendant processes, irrespective of what shell/application created them.\r\n\r\n* PowerShell \"listens to\" only _2_ environment variables, `$env:PSModulePath` being one of them.\r\n\r\n* From what I understand, Linux environments (all of them?) already have file `/etc/environment` as a system-wide, shell-independent mechanism for defining environment variables.\r\n\r\n* That said, if a set of environment variables is truly only used by _PowerShell_, then the system-wide _PowerShell_ profile - `$profile.AllUsersAllHosts` - arguably _is_ the right place to define them.\r\n\r\n   * This solution would also work for macOS, which doesn't have a system-wide mechanism for defining environment variables (anymore).\r\n   * (macOS has `/etc/profile`, which the default shell is expected to process, which (a) doesn't take effect for GUI applications, and (b) requires the default shell to honor this expectation and (c) requires the default shell to understand POSIX-shell syntax (which PowerShell, if it were defined as the default shell, wouldn't [_Update_: `/etc/profile` and `~/.profile` now _are_ honored if you start with `pwsh -l` or use PowerShell as the default shell]).",
