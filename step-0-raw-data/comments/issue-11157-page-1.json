    "body": "@Silver-Fang I assume you are trying to use the function `EachZ` as a delegate there?\r\n\r\nThe main problem (at least with binding) is that PowerShell's binder doesn't attempt to determine what type of delegate you want based on the *contents* of the script block provided.  If there's one overload that takes a delegate (or the delegate isn't the ambigious part) it can figure it out, otherwise every single overload seems like it matches as far as the binder is concerned.  You can get around this by casting:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[Threading.Tasks.Parallel]::ForEach(\r\n    [IO.Directory]::GetDirectories($PWD.Path),\r\n    [Action[string]]$function:EachZ)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat'll make it past binding, but it'll hit the bigger problem.  You can't run a `ScriptBlock` on a thread without a default `Runspace`.  It just throws.  Even if you could, it would just marshal the invocation back to the thread it came from, making the API pointless.\r\n\r\nIn other words, you just really can't use `Parallel.ForEach`.  Use `Start-ThreadJob` or similar instead.",
