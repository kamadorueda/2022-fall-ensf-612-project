    "body": "> I don't know where the general fix should be done (in OmniSharp to follow modern .Net SDK behavior or in .Net SDK).\r\n\r\nHere are my thoughts on this. Generating the resource classes under a /gen folder to move them out of the /obj folder is the wrong fix.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be that you want design time intellisense for these resource files, which is understandable. The problem is that these backing files are only generated when the Build task is run in MSBuild. Design time builds do not run the Build task, instead they run the Compile task. Since these files aren't generated during when Compile is run, they are not considered part of the compilation and not added to the open Workspace.\r\n\r\nYou can add a short Target to run the resource generator before the Compile task (See https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-vscode/issues/3781#issuecomment-630999837). Now they will be part of the Compilation and will be part of the Workspace when working from an IDE. They will also be updated when they are changed within the IDE instead of requiring a full build. Since you likely do not want them to be regenerated constantly, defining the Inputs and Outputs for targets is the MSBuild mechanism so that targets are only run when changes have been made.\r\n\r\n",

We can only create a \"workaround\".\r\nRight place for the fix is either OmniSharp repo or .Net SDK repo.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned .Net explicitly moved generating strong typed resources from design time to build time - it is new standard. I don't think they will change this. So expectation is that OmniSharp will follow the new behavior too.\r\n\r\nAs for workarounds, we have two ones:\r\n- put new files in custom `gen` directory\r\n- add new target\r\n\r\nI don't like adding new target because this again changes standard .Net SDK behavior - it can have \r\n side effects and later we can catch other issues.\r\n",

Here are some but not all the benefits:\r\n1. No need to run `Start-ResGen` before the build when there is any new resource files/strings added.\r\n2. Other powershell projects can do the same in .csproj for their resource strings, without having to copy over the `src\\ResGen` code and the related build script.\r\n\r\nHowever, the built-in resgen tool is not ready yet for us to depend on, and hence your workaround in the `Microsoft.PowerShell.GraphicalHost.csproj` project.\r\nThe changes in `Microsoft.PowerShell.GraphicalHost.csproj` is what we felt most concerned. A proposal is to use a hybrid way moving toward our ultimate goal:\r\n1. for this PR, remove the changes to `Microsoft.PowerShell.GraphicalHost.csproj` and keep the rest\r\n1. keep `src\\Res` and make it only to generate `.cs` files for the `GraphicalHost.csproj`\r\n\r\nSo only the resources for `GraphicalHost.csproj` are generated using our existing tool, and all rest resources are handled by the built-in tool in MSBuild.\r\nDo you think that's feasible?",
