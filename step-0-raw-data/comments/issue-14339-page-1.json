    "body": "This doesn't repro on macOS, but on Linux, it appears that background processes will automatically be stopped if it attempts to read from stdin.  Workaround for now is:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npwsh -command \"Get-Module -ListAvailable\" < /dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe input redirection will effectively close stdin, so the process won't be stopped.  It appears that Linux will send a SIGTTIN signal to the process if it tries to read from the console, but is not in the foreground.  However, pwsh doesn't handle signals (because .NET doesn't expose it).  Related to https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11215\r\n",
