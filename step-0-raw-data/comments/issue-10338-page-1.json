    "body": "@PaulHigin: Regarding the intermittent hang, my suspicion is that there is a timing issue with the initial handshake in MS-PSRDP, where the initial outgoing message from the client fires before the server starts actively listening for requests, at which point both client and server are waiting for communication from one another: the client waits for the server to respond, and the server waits for the client to tell it what to do. I believe this is an existing issue, not new, and it can probably be reproduced with the original set of APIs that MS-PSRDP supports.",

    "body": "@PaulHigin Thinking about this more, and reading through the code this morning, I'm convinced that the scenario I shared above is the root cause, and the issue I tripped on is related to issue #8012.\r\n\r\nNeither `RunspaceState` nor `RunspacePoolState` have a \"Ready\" state. They only have `Opened`, and they both of them do processing after they have entered the `Opened` state, which is the wrong thing to do when it comes to asynchronous processing. The test that hangs intermittently waits for the job to enter the `Running` state before using the new MS-PSRDP APIs, but jobs can enter a `Running` state before the listener is ready to receive requests in the remote runspace. When this happens, remote APIs invoked against the remote runspace will appear hung.\r\n\r\nThis issue is not related to the changes in this PR, but this PR and the original test suite written to validate these changes exposed the issue. That should be handled separately, as an RFC according to [the committee review of #8012](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/8012#issuecomment-457011612), which should propose a solution for both `Runspace` and `RunspacePool` event handling to ensure that SDK users can build code that can know with confidence that the runspace they are accessing via the SDK is ready for them to use it asynchronously. I've added that RFC to my list of tasks to do, so that we can get that discussion started and resolve this problem for SDK users who do async processing with PowerShell.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I just changed the Pester tests that use the new MS-PSRDP APIs such that they won't run until the runspace is truly ready. The easiest workaround I could come up with was to add a breakpoint and wait for the runspace to hit that breakpoint before using the APIs. Making this change allows me to run the tests over and over and over, and it never hangs. I'll commit that change in just a moment.",
