If you want to manage Windows DNSServer using the PowerShell module from Linux, you can do this via PowerShell remoting.  Using [implicit remoting](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff720181.aspx) you can run scripts locally on Linux that actually execute remotely on the Windows target (after setting up the PSSession).\r\n\r\nIf the ask is to manage Linux DNS servers, then that would need to be a completely different module that someone would have to author.",

Agree it would be nice to have this functionality on Linux.  We have the same need as @archmangler and are currently connecting over WinRM with our ansible installation using pywinrm to access the DNS cmdlets with Powershell.  In ansible it can be as simple as using [this](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/win_command_module.html), but it's better to avoid WinRM as it has a laundry list of its own problems.  \r\n\r\n@archmangler FYI I was able to get nsupdate to work at Linux command line a while back with Windows DNS Server.  Again, not \"Windows-specific\" and not supported by MSFT, though.",
