    "body": "@rjmholt Thank you for asking this question! I have been troubleshooting problems that I have not been able to explain for a few days using Windows PowerShell from within a custom application, and `CreateNestedPowerShell` ended up being the issue. The moment I switched away from it, the problem went away. Ugh.\r\n\r\nOne of the symptoms of this that I was seeing was my event handlers for data streams (verbose, warning, information, etc.) working just fine until the moment I would invoke CreateNestedPowerShell, after which the event handlers stopped receiving events. I could see messages being generated (the application also has a custom host, and it was receiving the messages), but the event handlers were just not.",
