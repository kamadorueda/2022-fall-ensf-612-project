Feel free to disregard that part. 🙂 \r\n\r\nI did look into that at some point, though, since some folx were wanting that. Apparently typical UDP port test tools just do the reverse of the TCP port test -- send a UDP packet, if any response is received, it is assumed that port is closed. Otherwise you have to assume it's open. Naturally that leads to a lot of false positives, but given then nature of UDP that's about as good as you can get. :joy:",

Lot of whitespace in the table with a header name that long, and generally maybe 2-3 characters in a given cell in the column.\r\n\r\nThat's one of the reasons I chose the name `Latency` in the `PingStatus` and `TraceStatus` outputs over `RoundtripTime` (which is, from memory, what the actual underlying property on a `PingReply` object is in .NET Core). I would probably err on the side of consistency there and keep the same name, unless there's a need for a different name here. ",

    "body": "@jackdcasey any sort of UDP test would be near impossible. If an app sends a server a UDP datagram, many (most?) services do not return a response.  And the few that do return a response are not consistent. \r\n\r\nYou could hard code a few special cases (eg DNS, NFS. and maybe a few more) where you know what the service would do if you sent it an appropriate UDP 'command'. You could even add a -**CommonUDPPort** parameter (to mirror the **-CommonTCPPort** parameter in **Test-NetConnection**), and create specific tests for DNS, etc.\r\n\r\nWith DNS, for example, send the target server a query for foo.local, and time the NXDomain response. Report back how long the return took.  You could do something similar for NTP (Network Time Protocol), BOOTP/DHCP. NNP (Network News Protocol), and maybe even Quote of the day protocol., TFTP, RTSP, RIP, and OSPF. It's been a while since I studied these protocols, but some of these could be tested/measured using carefully constructed UDP packets that return a specific expected response. \r\n\r\nNot sure it's worth it, but testing UDP services like this would be very cool. Testing UDP has never been easy! :-)\r\n",
