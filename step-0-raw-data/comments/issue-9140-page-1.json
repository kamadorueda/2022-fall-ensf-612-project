It is also not possible to change the behavior of `fc.exe` unless you want to break batch scripts on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia article you cited is about `errno`, not exit status, which is another concept. I found [here](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) and [here](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1570.pdf) (page 352).\r\n\r\n> The value of status may be 0, `EXIT_SUCCESS`, `EXIT_FAILURE`, [CX] or any other value, though only the least significant 8 bits (that is, `status & 0377`) shall be available from `wait()` and `waitpid()`; the full value shall be available from `waitid()` and in the `siginfo_t` passed to a signal handler for `SIGCHLD`. \r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n> Finally, control is returned to the host environment. If the value of status is zero or `EXIT_SUCCESS`, an implementation-deﬁned form of the status successful termination is returned. If the value of status is `EXIT_FAILURE`, an implementation-deﬁned form of the status unsuccessful termination is returned. Otherwise the status returned is implementation-deﬁned.\r\n\r\n**In particular, POSIX standard doesn't say whether exit status 123 means success or failure.** Also, the implementation-defined sense of failure of a native command might not be worth an `ErrorRecord` for the caller in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nAside from that not being a POSIX standard, the methodology of sticking to POSIX standard is good as long as you're only playing with POSIX. However, not all platforms use POSIX. It is much more important to keep consistency among platforms PowerShell would like to support. Moreover, automatically writing error records after native command invocation could create a whole lot of problems for existing scripts who didn't expect them and handled the exit code manually.\r\n\r\nEven if we're speculating the exist status and writing an error record. The design such feature is difficult and may lead to more troubles. For example, are you throwing a terminating error or writing a non-terminating error? What if you want to inspect and wrap the error in a more object-oriented way before it is finally written to the error stream? Do you have to `$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'` and `try-catch` for every native command invocation?\r\n\r\nIn general, I suggest wrapping native commands in a separate PowerShell cmdlet/function, which handles all the conversion between the native, untyped, binary, process-level isolated world and PowerShell.\r\n\r\n@mklement0 It is a very bad idea to invoke native commands directly given PowerShell's way of handling native pipe. Using `Start-Process` avoids object-oriented pipe pollution while allowing the native command to print output to the screen.",

    "body": "> I don't think there is any dispute that, even if not official, an exit status of 0 conventionally and in most cases means success and non-0 means error. I understand that there are some corner cases, but ultimately this behavior is counter-intuitive in the vast majority of cases.\r\n\r\nI think you need some research on how many current scripts break (or show otherwise undesired error messages) if we automatically write an error when a native command returns non-zero value.\r\n\r\nI agree that 0 usually means success. But it is quite debatable whether non-0 means error. **For example, GNU `diff` returns 1 for difference found and greater than 1 for errors.**\r\n\r\nW.r.t. #7774, I will make a separate comment in that thread.\r\n\r\nCreating the error record and then catching it is bad for performance, and well-written code should always handle the error and convert them into a readable representation (instead of exit status). The demand to handle them should be prioritized.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it is always the case people want to know why a command fails. If the command has written to `stderr`, one already can read it; otherwise, you want to check `$LASTEXITCODE`.",

    "body": "Turns out that this request is a duplicate of #3415, which led to lively debated RFC draft https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/88.\r\n\r\n@GeeLaw\r\n\r\n> It is a very bad idea to invoke native commands directly given PowerShell's way of handling native pipe. Using Start-Process avoids object-oriented pipe pollution while allowing the native command to print output to the screen.\r\n\r\nThis is a tangent, for sure, but I find your advice highly problematic, so it is worth addressing:\r\n\r\nA core function of any shell - including PowerShell - is the synchronous execution of console programs (command-line utilities), with the invoked program's standard streams connected to the calling shell's.\r\n\r\nWith PowerShell now being multi-platform, this is ever more important, because on Unix platforms there is a wealth of capable - and fast - command-line utilities available.\r\n\r\nWhile PowerShell cannot \"speak objects\" with native programs, it does have a shared language, and that is _text_.\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of command-line utilities \"speak text\", and in the vast majority of cases you want synchronous execution and either want to _capture_ or _suppress_ text output by such utilities, which calls for _direct invocation_, not use of `Start-Process`.\r\n\r\nE.g., get the current branch of the Git repository in the current location:\r\n```powerShell\r\nPS> $currentBranch = git symbolic-ref --short HEAD\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven in the rare cases where a utility outputs _raw byte streams_ - which PowerShell's streams cannot handle - you wouldn't use `Start-Process` - instead, you would synchronously invoke a shell that _can_ handle those byte streams; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Generate a file with 100 random bytes.\r\n# The redirection must be handled by `sh`, because PowerShell would interpret the raw\r\n# bytes as text.\r\nPS> sh -c 'dd if=/dev/urandom bs=1 count=100 > t.txt'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've summarized the considerations when capturing output from external programs in  [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35980675/45375). I encourage you to provide feedback there, if you disagree with the above (the answer was written a while ago, pre .NET Core, so raw byte output isn't covered yet).\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
