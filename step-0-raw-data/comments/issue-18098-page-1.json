    "body": "@ironyman  there are at least 2 reasons why this can't be the **default**. \r\nFirst I  don't think PowerShell has way to learn which ANSI sequences are and aren't supported,\r\nSecond making sense of it in a remote session is problematic. \r\n\r\nHowever you can customize this to suit yourself and load the customization from your profile.  To do this \r\n1. copy `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\FileSystem.format.ps1xml`  to convenient location : I used `file.psm1xml` in my profile directory.\r\n2. Open the copy in your favourite editor. \r\n3. Do a one-by-one search and replace of \r\n```\r\n<PropertyName>Name</PropertyName>\r\n```\r\nwith \r\n```\r\n <ScriptBlock>\"$([char]27)[96m$([char]27)]8;;file://$($_.FullName)$([char]27)`\\$($_.Name)$([char]27)]8;;$([char]27)`\\$([char]27)[0m\"</ScriptBlock>\r\n```\r\nI'm making the links cyan (96) for good contrast and using `$([char]27)` instead of ``` `e ``` because that will work on PowerShell 5 as well as 7 \r\nAs you do the replacements if they are in a `<ListItem>` add `<Label>Name</Label>`  inside the same item at the same level as the script block.  If they are in a table look for the corresponding TableColumnHeader it may be `<TableColumnHeader/>` if so replace it with  `<TableColumnHeader><Label>Name</Label></TableColumnHeader>`\r\n\r\n4. Save the file and load it with `Update-FormatData -PrependPath .\\file.ps1xml`  (use your chosen file name here) for me it looks like this \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/190624190-56f5dbd2-69bc-4223-8fd6-a97d227fb8c9.png)\r\n(proving it works with 5 as well !) \r\n\r\n5. Make any adjustments and run ` Update-FormatData `  no need for -PrependPath. \r\n6. You can (conditionally) run `Update-FormatData -PrependPath  ...` from your profile.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to post my version as a gist. \r\n\r\n",
