I am not sure if the installer (the MSI package) or the OS removed the file.  I was watching the contents of the folder and the file was deleted towards the end of the install (which went pretty quickly).  I made a copy of the shortcut file before the install.  Restoring this file did not completely restore the pin.  The icon was still missing.  I clicked on the 'Change Icon...' button and this interesting message appeared.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26179051/53468453-e876ae80-3a1f-11e9-8d82-1351cd3d6577.png)\r\n\r\nThe restored pin shortcut does work, it just doesn't have an icon.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n",

At that time the installation directory had the full version name in it, so it made sense to auto-generate the Guid. Now that the directory name is a constant `6` we could go for the approach of just having 2 separate Guids for RTM and preview and then this might not occur any more.\r\nNote though that the team is usually reluctant to add such improvements in a patched version of PS and 6.3 might be based on MSIX, which is a new installation technology. Therefore even if we submit a PR it might not make it to the end user in time",
