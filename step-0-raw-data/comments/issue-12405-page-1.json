    "body": "@TylerLeonhardt `PSCommand` is just a property bags of _strings_, parameters etc. So it just contains the _name_ of the command which won't be resolved until the PowerShell object is invoked. If you actually want any information about a command you really, really should be using CommandInfo objects. \r\n\r\nBut, it would be nice if the `ToString()` on `PSCommand` returned what you want. It would be even nicer if the PowerShell `ToString()` returned a complete syntactically valid pipeline string to support code generation. This would make it easier for app developers to implement \"Show Me\" functionality.",

You'd have to add dot source/amp invocation operators too\r\n1. Wrap scripts in scriptblocks\r\n1. Add semi colons/new lines when `AddStatement` is used\r\n1. What to show when the command is a manually constructed `CommandInfo`\r\n1. How do you show `MergeMyResults`\r\n\r\nJust to clarify I totally understand where you're coming from.  I ran into the same thing and thought a while about how to get an accurate representation. I just want to make sure the aim isn't to get an equivalent invokable script, because there's too many scenarios where that will be super inconsistent.  If the aim is instead to just get a \"good enough\" `ToString` to make it easy to see what the `PSCommand` currently holds then 👍 👍 from me",
