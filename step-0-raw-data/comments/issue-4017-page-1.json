    "body": "I was further tracking down this behavior.  Get-ChildItem is just calling provider, so that's not where the problem is, but in PSProvider FileSystem. Checking the code there, I saw that problem seems to originate from Get-Item. And even further, it comes from **[IO.DirectoryInfo]** constructor. This one is trimming trailing spaces (including NBSP), which in this case is wrong.\r\n\r\nIn the above listed example (NBSP folder inside of c:\\temp), run these three commands:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$nbsp = (gci c:\\temp).Fullname \r\n# gets the full name of problem folder\r\n\r\n$nbsp.ToCharArray() | % {write-host $_ [byte]($_)} \r\n# lists all chars from name and their ascii values\r\n# we can see trailing NBSP\r\n\r\n[IO.DirectoryInfo]::new($nbsp)  \r\n# this returns wrong folder 'temp' and not the one with NBSP name\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan someone with more experience recheck this?",
