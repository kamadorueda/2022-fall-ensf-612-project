I believe the conclusion was that it was by design to allow folks to use a default value that otherwise wouldn't be permitted. e.g.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction test {\r\n    param(\r\n        [ValidateRange(0, [int]::MaxValue)] $Count = -1\r\n    )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't remember if it was marked by design or if it was just marked wontfix to not break folks doing that",

I've tagged one of them for WG-Language to follow up on; I think having some kind of parse time error is a good idea, myself. PSSA rules are an okay standin but I think there's a lot we can do at parse time that we aren't doing to prevent very obvious foot-gun scenarios.",
