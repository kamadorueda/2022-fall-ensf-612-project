These scenarios are fairly common and something that we will be actively facilitating in the future. Given that, even if we made this change no one could use it because they would have no idea when the cwd might change.  Also, it is entirely possible that existing users are depending on the fact that with initial cwd doesn't change after PowerShell has started. So, yes - this is a breaking change (though perhaps small and obscure). ",
