It may be due to the test machine is a VM. `Set-Date` doesn't work well with VMs.\r\n4. `Register-PackageSource` and `Get-PackageProvider` cannot be found -- PackageManagement related.\r\n\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/127450/20506705/9e7d9420-b00a-11e6-95ce-5e65176195bb.png)\r\n\r\nNone of the failures is related to swapping the order of `DoPrepare` and assigning `myInfo.ExpectingInput`.
