We should use Join-Path and something like `[portablepath]@()`. \r\nPowerShell should works with native paths in `dir | copy-item` without reparsing if we want to somehow get closer to productivity of cmd/bash shells.\r\nPowerShell should works with native paths internally and on top level (-Path/-LiteralPath parameters) - especially in interactive mode. Here we have some Issue and should address them. Why we should be escaping in Unix path on Unix? I suppose it's very annoying. Why we don't support '\\' in Unix path?\r\nI'm pretty sure that work in this direction can keep backward compatibility with Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nMaybe @mklement0 could make more-in-depth review provider path issues.",
