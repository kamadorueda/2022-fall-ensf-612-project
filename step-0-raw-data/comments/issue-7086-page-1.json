But otherwise it works fine on a clean install.",

    "body": "@TravisEz13 The PR is now fully ready for review, I just had to test the `AppVeyor` artifacts on a clean VM (locally I had some left-overs and it seems that the Windows search history when typing `[Windows key] PowerShell` it shows the old icon on my system where a previous version was already installed, but when following the shortcut, the shortcut is correct, therefore this is just an OS issue of the Windows search history caching since that does not happen on a system that never had a preview installed).",
