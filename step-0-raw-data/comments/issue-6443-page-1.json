The environments are _very_ different. \r\nPowerShell has an adaptable type system that abstracts many different underlying type systems. It has an extensible formatting system that renders objects to text. It has an object based pipeline. It has an adaptable prompt, tab completion etc.\r\n\r\nAll of these takes time to initialize, especially the extensible types and formatting systems.\r\n\r\nAs Steve said, there is an issue with the assemblies not being crossgen-ed as they should, so we spend quite a lot of extra time jitting IL. That must be fixed.\r\n\r\nBut even with that fixed, there are differences in scope and the dependencies on the CLR/DLR that will make powershell slower to start than cmd and python.\r\n",

    "body": "I would venture to guess that if python were to have a more expressive REPL and a deep framework available and ready to use on the first line, its load times would be on-par with `pwsh`. I have seen plenty of python scripts with long init times due to dependency loading for more advanced uses. Python starts fast by default because it loads with less available by default. Comparing the start times between PowerShell and other shells and scripting languages is a bit hard to do unless they are all closer in default feature parity. none of the languages I have experience with come with as mush on-by-default as PowerShell does (for better or worse).",

My profile takes nearly a second due to some modules like `posh-git` taking a long time to load. Due to general improvements, 7.0 is still faster than 6.2 to use for me simply because my `$Profile` loads faster. Out of curiosity: would it be e.g. possible to import a module in a non-blocking way as jobs don't work in this scenario? Using `Invoke-Pester` the first time takes over a second as well the first time due to the module needing to be imported (the module is currently not optimised with the module builder pattern to squeeze everything into a monolithic file at build time) and I see this part of the negative, laggy experience that PowerShell has in some scenarios (don't even get me started on tab completion, which sometimes takes seconds and even cancellation of a it takes ages....)",

    "body": "Having used PowerShell 2/3 extensively back on Windows, then having used bash/sh extensively on Linux, the startup time difference is absolutely staggering.\r\n\r\nWhere it really makes it painful for someone on Linux, is when running executable scripts using a shebang. Typically with bash you write a lot of scripts with a shebang, e.g `#!/usr/bin/env bash`\r\n\r\nyou also also might run numerous scripts in a row that call other scripts that also use the shebang\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n./foo\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n\r\n./bar\r\n```\r\n\r\n./bar\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\r\n\r\necho \"Hello from bar!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith bash/sh, this isn't a problem, you don't really notice any speed issues opening subshells / new processes like this.\r\n\r\nYou also might be calling numerous executable scripts in a row from the interactive shell.\r\n\r\nThe reason this matters, is that with pwsh, using the shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env pwsh`) causes each script ran to run as slow as that \"first startup\".\r\n\r\nThat means taking the example above, calling `foo` would take 2x the time it takes to just run `pwsh`.\r\n\r\nIt also means that running multiple powershell scripts (that use shebangs) in an interactive shell (either from say bash, or even already from powershell), is extremely slow.\r\n\r\nCompare this to when you first run `pwsh`, and then from inside that shell, run the exact same scripts but as `.ps1` files rather than relying on the shebang. It runs basically instantaneously (within the existing pwsh process).\r\n\r\nTo me, this is the biggest issue with the slow pwsh startup. It's not that it's slow on startup the first time that really matters, it's the fact that using shebangs means it makes every single invocation that slow or slower.\r\n\r\nSwitching from using shebangs to making everyone type `pwsh -File foo.ps1` or whatever, is not a smooth transition. Speaking from experience, I never call bash scripts by typing `bash foo.bash`, I make them executable and call them directly.",

(Such as for example the '<' file redirection operator missing, which is expected by some programs, such as vim, but luckily it can be fixed by telling it to use pipes instead.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, some updates that make `pwsh -c` viable for more or less instantaneous small things would be very welcome!\r\nThanks for all the work of the development team, my life is already much better by having a shell with proper syntax and programmability (e.g. the `| % { }` foreach and such things are awesome!

I know that this is a very messy solution, because variables and contexts could get mixed up, but if I am careful enough when writing the commands and ensure that they have no side effects (I mean, in terms of the execution context, otherwise it would make no sense to run the commands at all. :smile:) this could work.",

    "body": "Dear fellows, I am tired that PS 5.1 currently installed on my Windows 7 x64 (please, donâ€™t even mention W10) is unable to properly execute BOM-less *.ps1 with UTF8 strings (e.g. `$singer = \"BjÃ¶rk\"; echo $singer` outputs as BjÐ“Â¶rk). That's why I downloaded both (portable) PS 6.2.7 and 7.2.0p7 and run as follows `pwsh.exe .\\test.ps1`. Indeed, they have no problem outputting UTF8, but the execution time is 2x slower: 320ms (5) vs 694ms (7) vs 760ms (6). Delay is noticeable and annoying. \r\n\r\nI am not a developer to grasp all the aforementioned mumbo jumbo on why the progress turned into regress, but I remember [there was a trick][1] to make early versions of PS run faster by `ngen install`. Is there something similar here, or we're doomed?\r\n\r\n[1]: https://superuser.com/questions/627077/windows-powershell-is-taking-long-time-to-start-the-first-time-after-windows-log?noredirect=1&lq=1",
