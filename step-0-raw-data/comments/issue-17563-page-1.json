    "body": "Before <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/4405> and <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/4456>, the string values of the constants in PInvokeDllNames.cs depended on whether `CORECLR` was defined. Building for .NET Core used the API Set DLL names, but building for .NET Framework used the old-school kernel32.dll. I suppose that was easier to implement by collecting all the DLL names to one file than by writing `#if CORECLR` in every Platform Invoke declaration.",

I know not all APIs are in OneCore which is why we still use the DLL there, does that mean we need to avoid using the non-OneCore APIs or shield them somewhat. Should we be trying to find alternatives to non-OneCore APIs/not adding any more in the future or does it not really apply for PowerShell?",
