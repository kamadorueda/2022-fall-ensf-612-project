    "body": "WG-Engine discussed this issue today.\r\n\r\nOur opinion is that this issue is also related to the broader scope of work around wildcards and escaping in PowerShell -- see #7999.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the issue appears to mainly be that tab completion can't reliably get a properly-escaped value for the `-Path` parameter when the path contains wildcards. For this reason, `Set-Content` aka `cd` in PowerShell has the `-LiteralPath` parameter which should be used for these cases. Tab completion also appears to behave as expected for this parameter, so you can for example tab-complete `cd -literalpath ...` and you will get a usable path to `cd` to.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't appear feasible to fully correct the tab completion here, and as such we're resolving this as a won't-fix for the time being. It's likely the tab completion will be in a better position to be improved when #7999 has been addressed, as we'll have more confidence about whether paths need to be escaped multiple times or just the one time.\r\n\r\nThanks for the report! ðŸ’– ",
