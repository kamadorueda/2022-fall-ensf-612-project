    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT @joeyaiello this sounds like it could be a consequence of the missing WinRT libraries (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13042). Will the Appx module maintainers will want to package the WinRT libs with their module? Even if they do, it will mean anyone using newer versions of PS on older Windows versions will be unable to use the AppX module, since that module is shipped with Windows.\r\n\r\n@carlocardella can you provide the output from `Get-Error` after the failed import as well? Thanks! 😊 ",

The AppX module directly references WinRT types.  This exception is at type load because of how the `AssemblyRef` is encoded.\r\n\r\n> My question is whether we need both of those DLLs to get this WinMD support, or if we could ship something lighter that picks up the remaining right stuff off the Windows install.\r\n\r\nI'd love to be wrong but I'm pretty sure there's nothing PowerShell can ship to make this work, other than a new version of the AppX module.",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT That's awesome! Thanks for talking to them.\r\n\r\nHas there been any discussion with the runtime team regarding moving the assembly resolution exception? This is sort of an all or nothing scenario where if that part doesn't happen there won't be a need for the `put_` methods.\r\n\r\nJust to spell it all out in case any of this isn't clear, let say we have a TypeRef encoded like this:\r\n\r\n```il\r\n.assembly extern windowsruntime Windows\r\n{\r\n    .ver 255:255:255:255\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Windows]Windows.Foundation.AsyncStatus\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat sets the content type for the assembly as `WindowsRuntime`.\r\n\r\nAssembly resolution at a high level looks like this:\r\n\r\n1. Check if the content type is `WindowsRuntime` and throw `NotSupportedException`\r\n1. Run any `AssemblyResolve` event handlers\r\n1. Default resolve/load behavior\r\n\r\nSo ideally the PowerShell engine would be able to register an `AssemblyResolve` handler that looks something like this (psuedo code):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nAssembly Resolve(object sender, ResolveEventArgs args)\r\n{\r\n    if (args.Name.StartsWith(\"Windows\") && args.Name.Contains(\"WindowsRuntime\"))\r\n    {\r\n        return CsWinRTAssembly;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return null;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut because assembly resolution never makes it past the first step, that handler will never fire.  If the `NotSupportedException` could be moved until *after* assembly resolution doesn't find anything then compatibility could be kept.\r\n\r\nWithout that, these modules will still need to be recompiled and at that point they'll just use the `set_` accessors anyway.",

    "body": "> My workaround :\r\n> Try default Windows Powershell(version 5). It works fine with `Get-appxpackage` command.\r\n\r\nIs this really the best advice we can get? Somehow abandoning PowerShell 7 for Windows PowerShell is rather sub-optimal to say the last. \r\n\r\nI understand that some product teams may be too busy, or lazy, to get their cmdlets fully working with PowerShell 7.  But this issue is nearly a year old and is still present in PowerShell 7.1.3, and the latest 7.2 preview and daily build versions.  \r\n\r\nit does appear that you can force `Import-Module` to load the APPX module via compatibility. So can you extend the logic of the JSON file ban list to have a set of modules that Import-Module always loads using compatibility? So parhapx a powershell.config.json like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell \r\n \r\nPS C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7> cat .\\powershell.config.json\r\n{\r\n    \"WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityModuleDenyList\":  [\r\n                                                         \"PSScheduledJob\",\r\n                                                         \"BestPractices\",\r\n                                                         \"UpdateServices\"\r\n                                                     ],\r\n    \"Microsoft.PowerShell:ExecutionPolicy\":  \"RemoteSigned\",\r\n    \"WindowsPowerShellForceWindowsCompatibility\":  [\r\n                                                         \"Appx\"\r\n                                                     ]\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "\r\n@rklec\r\n\r\nHere is how I would solve the problem. \r\n\r\nIf I am running `powershell.exe` (Windows PowerShell 5.1) then AppX works there and I don't need to make any checks or use the work-around. \r\n\r\nIf I am running `pwsh.exe` (PowerShell 7) then I can use the work-around when needed. When you use it is up to you. You can put it in your profile, certain scripts, or run it manually. \r\n\r\nYou can also modify my example to make additional checks. For example, you might use [WMI](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/samples/getting-wmi-objects--get-ciminstance-) to check what computer the script is running on or what operating system it has. Then, my example won't run on computers that don't use PowerShell 7. \r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 7, your other options are to use the [PackageManager class](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/Windows.Management.Deployment.PackageManager) or [DISM](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/dism-app-package--appx-or-appxbundle--servicing-command-line-options). \r\n\r\nTo answer your question, it looks like the SemanticVersion class is not available in PowerShell 5.1: \r\n\r\n![Semantic Version Class Not In SDK 5.1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51273929/183414115-96a62c19-c7de-44ce-9859-fae500274f24.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, the format of `$PSVersionTable` changed between PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7. Both of these issues would have to be addressed before my example would work across all PowerShell versions. Hopefully, some of these other options are helpful. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\n\r\n",
