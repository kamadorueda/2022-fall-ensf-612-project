This was a little tricky to track down.\r\n\r\nThe problem was a recent update to Windows Defender, which has a Ransomware Protection feature that automatically includes profile folders (`C:\\Users\\<yourname>\\Documents` etc) as \"Protected Folders\".  Applications such as cmd.exe and Powershell Core (pwsh.exe) have to be manually added under \"Allow an app through Controlled folder access\".  There seems to be no way to exclude a subfolder such as PowerShell\\Modules under a Protected Folder that's been added (and I'm thinking it would not be smart idea to remove `C:\\Users\\<yourname>\\Documents` being a Malware-protected folder)\r\n\r\nDoes this mean Powershell needs to reconsider the Module location being under \"MyDocuments\" for the local user under Windows?  **Perhaps the MSI file should add an exception for the Module location as part of the setup?**\r\n\r\nFeel free to close, as I should likely create a new Issue based on this new information.
