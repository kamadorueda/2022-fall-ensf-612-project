Currently the \"by design\" behavior is to run each parallel script in new runspace sessions with default initialization.  But I am wondering if we should have a `-UseExistingSessionState` parameter switch that initializes each parallel session from the current running sessions: imported modules, function definitions, PSDrives, type definitions.  Variables would be a problem because of threading issues, but maybe readonly variables can be transferred.  But the default behavior would be performant with standard session intialization.",
