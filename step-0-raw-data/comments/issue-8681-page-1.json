However, `LanguagePrimitives.ConvertTo()` is public, whereas `ScanNumber()` is not. So perhaps the ticket is adding a default parameter to the internal `ScanNumber()` method: `Parser.ScanNumber(string strToConvert, Type resultType, bool shouldTryCoercion = true)`. Then when it's called from `LanguagePrimitives.ConvertTo()`, you can use `Parser.ScanNumber(str, t, shouldTryCoercion: false)` while leaving all other calls the same.\r\n\r\nThe relevant Parser code would then be:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n if (shouldTryCoercion && (token == null || !tokenizer.IsAtEndOfScript(token.Extent))) \r\n { \r\n     // We call ConvertTo, primarily because we expect it will throw an exception, \r\n     // but it's possible it could succeed, e.g. if the string had commas, our lexer \r\n     // will fail, but Convert.ChangeType could succeed. \r\n  \r\n    return LanguagePrimitives.ConvertTo(str, toType, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture); \r\n```",
