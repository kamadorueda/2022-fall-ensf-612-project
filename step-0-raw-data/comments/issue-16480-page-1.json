    "body": "> Why don't Git like file extensions?\r\n\r\nIn Unix-like systems the piece of information that tells the operating system that file is executable is an attribute of the underlying file system â€“ the _execute_ permission. It has no relation what so ever with the actual file name. In case the file that should be executed happens to be script, like Bash, Python, PowerShell, Perl, etc., etc. , then a special notation starting with `#!` (called [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))) in the beginning of the file tells the OS how proceed with the file. So anything can be executable. This concept does not exist in Windows.\r\n\r\nI have no actual knowledge about how Git was ported to Windows but just based on their web site and my experience, there is some kind of emulation layer that allows for Git developers to do things Unix-way, e.g without the need to care about extensions, and the emulation layer then does its best to implement those operations in the Windows world. This is clearly visible in the hooks as, even in Windows, they need to have that shebang notation but with `pwsh` as the executable[1].\r\n\r\nAdding support for extensions would require curated and parametrized list of allowed extensions, and well defined search order for those in case there is multiple extensions with the same file name. It's a can of worms from the Unix perspective.\r\n\r\n[1] Actually, the executable in the example is Git provided Windows port of [`env`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env) which will then launch `pwsh` with the original script file name as a parameter .",

    "body": "> Windows signature checking is based on file extension, and this is something we cannot control.\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT @PaulHigin I've recently gone through this code and it seems like the `.ps1` extension isn't strictly needed.\r\n\r\nWhile yes pwsh uses an API which takes in the filename there is also an API that is already implemented where you can supply the contents of a file and specify the extension yourself. In the case where `-File my_script_without_ext` was used then PowerShell can read the file like normal and use that content with the API.\r\n\r\nThis is even possible through the `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` cmdlet today. You can change the path used to something that is already signed, this just uses Pester to demonstrate which is more likely to be present.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$psd1Content = Get-Module -Name Pester -ListAvailable |\r\n    Sort-Object -Property Version -Descending |\r\n    Select-Object -First 1 -Property @{N='PSPath'; E={$_.Path}} |\r\n    Get-Content -Raw -AsByteStream\r\n\r\nGet-AuthenticodeSignature -SourcePathOrExtension '.psd1' -Content $psd1Content\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo need for temp file and pwsh has to read the contents anyway so it's not like it's doing extra work.",

    "body": "If PowerShell script really needs to pass AppLocker and WDAC (understandable) and it works with extensions only, and Git is not going to change how hooks are called (which seems to be the case), then there is not too many options left. And the remaining ones are not pretty either.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to take advantage of the fact that in Windows an executable can be called without extension. So, my suggestion is to make `pwsh.exe` aware of its own file name and adjust its behaviour based on that name like this:\r\nWhen `pwsh.exe` is renamed to something else and called without extension, it searches for and evaluates a `.ps1` file with the same name as the executable and located in the same directory just  as if `pwsh.exe` would have been called with that file name as a parameter.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a diretory `C:\\repo\\.git\\hooks` contains files\r\n\r\n- `prepare-commit-msg.ps1`\r\n- `prepare-commit-msg.exe` (renamed `pwsh.exe`)\r\n\r\nthen a command `C:\\repo\\.git\\hooks\\prepare-commit-msg` (without extension) would make PowerShell to behave like the command would have been `\"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe\" C:\\repo\\.git\\hooks\\prepare-commit-msg.ps1`, while passing rest of the parameters to the script and taking care of STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR as usual.\r\n\r\nThere is some pros and cons to this.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n- It should work correctly, even with AppLocker and WDAC applying to both EXEs and scripts.\r\n- Executable is the same, no changes needed to publisher or hash based policies, unless publisher policy require exact file name.\r\n- Hooks are not versioned content of the repository. They are local to the computer hosting the repo. Thus, hooks are not pushed or cloned with the rest of the files.\r\n\r\nCons\r\n- It's a hack.\r\n- Needs one copy of `pwsh.exe` for each Git hook.\r\n- PowerShell executable would be outside its default path, which might cause problems with finding DLLs and require changes to path based policies.\r\n- Parameters cannot be passed to `pwsh.exe` without some new TBD method (envs, maybe?)",
