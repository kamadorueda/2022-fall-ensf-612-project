This is because src\\System.Management.Automation\\engine\\CommandSearcher.cs has the following `Dbg.Assert(\r\n                !string.IsNullOrEmpty(name),\r\n                \"Caller should verify name\");`. \r\n\r\nMy question is, does this assert belong here? Issue #10165 was closed because it was decided that variable names and alias names with whitespace should be possible. So should Get-Command return the whitespace alias if it exists?",

This is what ultimately causes the index out of range exception to be thrown at line 1102 `                if (_commandName[0] == '.' || _commandName[0] == '~' || _commandName[0] == '\\\\')\r\n`. If I comment out the `_commandName.TrimEnd(Utils.Separators.PathSearchTrimEnd);` The behavior of `Get-Command ' '` is as expected and everything else _seems_ to work fine. \r\n\r\nMy next question is (and I realize this is asking a lot), does anyone have any ideas why the `_commandName = _commandName.TrimEnd(Utils.Separators.PathSearchTrimEnd);` is there?",
