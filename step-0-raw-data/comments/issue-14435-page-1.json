I'm not really sure how though, those streams don't make it to anything like the formatter where this could be processed in a host agnostic way.  In most cases `MshCommandRuntime.WriteVerbose` goes directly to `PSHostUserInterface.WriteVerboseLine`.\r\n\r\nAnother challenge is that escape sequences do not do much to describe what a GUI host should do.  I didn't see the PR at the time, but if I did I would have recommended removing the customizations of the other streams until this was fleshed out a little bit more.",
