I'm sure a lot of people are missing it in those languages. I definitely did at multiple occasion when writing C# code.\r\n\r\nBut, I also agree that it might just bring more demand for other mathematical operators and I'm not sure if it's really PowerShell's main goal. In the end, the amount of projects who are doing advanced mathematics with PowerShell is probably very low.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I did those changes as a small exercise to discover PowerShell's code ans also because the issue was marked with the Hacktoberfest label ðŸ˜„. It was very instructive for me, so no hurt feelings if you decide that in the end it's not interesting to add this operator. I understood when I started that it was going to create philosophical questioning about the use of the operator (it had already started in the issue).\r\n\r\nIf you do decide that you'd like to have the operator, I'll be happy to update my code and fix all the issues that @lzybkr gave me in the feedback.",

Some of the concerns:\r\n  - prefer to have one canonical way `Math.Pow()` rather than allowing multiple ways of doing the same thing\r\n  - adding this operator incurs the cost of spending more time reviewing the semantics and setting precedent for other possible operators\r\n  - `Math.Pow()` seems sufficient for the limited expected usage\r\n\r\nWe thank @Gimly for taking the time working on this, but perhaps pick up a different `Hacktoberfest` issue :)",
