Hashtables were pseudo-objects which included \"methods\": assigning a scriptblock to a key allowed you to invoke that key as `$table.method(...)`.  Later on, where we introduced the ability to add instance members with `Add-Member` the \"method\" mechanism was removed. Around this time, the separator was also changed from `=>` to `=` but the property hiding was never cleaned up.  ",

    "body": "@BrucePay it would be a 'significant breaking change' to reverse the logic in the case of a small handful of properties that are attached to hashtables?\n\nThat doesn't strike me as particularly significant. I'm not suggesting removing the property->key mapping, I'm suggesting querying the object's actual properties first, in the way that is likely to be expected by anyone who knows the barest basics of hashtables.\n\nI'm suggesting that because we have the native key access syntax, we can just ensure properties are queried first when using the syntax that is *designed to access properties*, so if there is an overlap like this (property with the same name as a key), said property is not hidden. Accessing the key itself would simply be done by using the standard collection accessor `$hash['keys']`\n\nUnless you make extensive use of the present state of things, where you deliberately hide the hashtable properties with keys, it would break... Absolutely nothing, no? Using it for non-colliding key names would still work just fine, and if you (foolishly, perhaps) had some code where you took user input to insert keys to a hashtable, the possibility of them *breaking your code* if you don't know about the broken behaviour is quietly removed, letting you enumerate keys as per normal.",
