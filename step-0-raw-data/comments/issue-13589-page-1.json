    "body": "@iSazonov When you talk about AST being more accurate, powerful and reliable what are you comparing it to? The approach proposed in this PR gives us a way better baseline, and is able to profile any script without having to resort to AST. This is a huge limitation of PSProfiler / Measure-Script, you can analyze only a single scriptblock, and any referenced scripts are not instrumented. And you have to have an AST Visitor that understands every branch of your code and instruments it. This PR shows a way to do this without any of that.\r\n\r\nAs for Code Coverage, I am sure it will help Pester a lot. Some additional analysis will need to be done on the returned data to identify lines that can't be hit (e.g. empty line, return, else etc.), but that is pretty easy, we already have AST analyzer that does that, and imho we could write a simple regex that gets us 95% there. Or do you see some obvious gap that I am missing?\r\n\r\nAll in all, I am really excited about this change, and would love to get it in one form or another. ðŸ™‚",

    "body": "One more thought.\r\n\r\n> I have big doubts that the callback is applicable here. A common practice is to release events so that an external tool can collect and analyze them.\r\n\r\nThis is always a classic tradeoff. Do we allow arbitrary callbacks so we can reuse this later but which could become a doorway for all kinds of issues, or do we specialise the API? Or do we make the callbacks into asynchronous events?\r\n\r\nFor a trace API, I don't think it needs to be synchronous (i.e. it can simply emit events with timestamps to subscriber threads). In turn that makes the API a bit more cohesive; it's not for arbitrary callbacks, but for trace events saying when and where code was hit. The only problem with not being synchronous is that a subscriber needs a way to know that a session has ended.",

    "body": "> As I already said it is not right place for the profile feature. It is better to use *-Trace cmdlets or create new *-Profile cmdlets.\r\n\r\nI don't get this. The cmdlet already has -Trace parameter, it combines Debugging with Trace, which is exactly what I do. I just write to a collection instead of writing it to debug stream. I don't do any profiling in the code, I just write a Trace. \r\n\r\nProfiling would be additional functionality provided by external module that would consume the data. This would be just a very simple way to get the data. They are not very useful by themselves, but it allows me to keep the change to PowerShell minimal.\r\n\r\n> Why is it worse than Set-PSDebug -Trace 1 / Set-PSDebug -Off.\r\n\r\n> Also, for better UX we could implement Enable-Profiler/Disable-Profiler/Set-Profiler.\r\n\r\nTrace-Command does not enable debugging by default. I have to enable tracing of my trace event, and then somehow enable debugging, but not by Set-PSDEbug -trace 1, because that writes to Debug stream. And then I need to run the code.\r\n\r\n> It is easy to implement such inMemoryListener. Also alternative scenarios could prefer a file output. The output should be binary (like EWT does) for performance. (If we converted timestamps to strings or Datetime we would lost performance over 100x or more.)\r\n\r\nYes, maybe, but why bother with adding another trace listener? We would also need to make it  work for all the possible traces, because the current api of Trace-Command is not suited well for using different tracers with different sources of events.\r\n\r\n> As for filtering, I'd expect Pester enable the profiler before a file run and disable after the file finished. \r\n\r\nYes but it would enable it before running the tests file, because we don't control how users import their dependencies. So we need a way to tell the profiler which files we are interested in, otherwise it captures everything from everywhere. Putting a lot of noise in the trace, and storing unnecessary data. \r\n\r\n> If we want to have a profiler feature in Engine it must works for both scripts and binaries too. I'd expect users will want to implement alternative profilers (in different IDEs).\r\n\r\nBy binaries you mean binary modules? That would require a totally different approach and I and the current tracing that writes to Debug does not do that either. Profiling your own \"C#\" code is not hard, you have VS and all the awesome tooling at your disposal. I don't see why we should complicated it with this. \r\n\r\nI also don't understand how implementing different profilers depends on being able to trace binary code. And I doubt there will be more that a handful of profilers, there is only so much you can do with the trace.\r\n\r\n> It is right to have Timestamp as binary but we still lost performance on coping Extent. We could issue events for file start and file end, between them events could contain Timestamp and Line number as binaries.\r\n\r\nIs it not just copying the struct that has a reference to IScriptExtent that already exists? I don't see any impact on the execution time, and it also is running in debug mode, so we expect some perf degradation to be there.\r\n\r\nHaving an event for start and end of file is further complicating the problem. \r\n\r\n",

This way you can hook it up from PowerShell, by simply providing a scriptblock. You can also debug the provided scriptblock. With my basic example there is again no significant perf degradation even if running powershell scriptblock as the callback.  \r\n\r\nI don't think that making it async is worth it, because it is obvious that the more work you do in the callback the slower the code will be, and it would be difficult to leverage that in powershell. In C# we can simply push the data into a queue and process it on another thread, if we need. But seeing that even using scriptblock callback causes no visible perf degradation it probably won't be needed.\r\n\r\nThe naming and location could be improved. Do you have any suggestions?\r\n",

    "body": "I honestly never considered `Set-PSDebug`, possibly because I was never a fan of the cmdlet, but I do see it is a viable approach for some scenarios.\r\n\r\nI do prefer an EventSource (or ETW for Windows) based approach. I actually started this approach a long time back [here](https://github.com/lzybkr/PowerShell/commit/d620bb4494b94a85a479ebd62ce935ba8e797ff5).\r\n\r\nA huge benefit to ETW is the ability to enable a trace from outside the process. It's more work to produce useful reports, but it's useful when you need to profile:\r\n* an already running script that you don't want to restart\r\n* hosted PowerShell processes that may not expose `Set-PSDebug`\r\n\r\nThat said, in-process is important too, and EventSource supports that. I don't think EventSource is a huge effort to support in-process, but my WIP is incomplete because my approach introduces some extra complexity to support ETW/out-of-process reporting.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is to, while measuring, add as little impact as possible, collecting minimal information (collecting a GUID + sequence number while tracing) - then post process. In-process is a bit easier as the data structures are still in memory, ETW would require additional events to enable mapping the GUID+sequence number back to something meaningful. These events would be written after stopping the trace, similar to the .Net rundown events.",
