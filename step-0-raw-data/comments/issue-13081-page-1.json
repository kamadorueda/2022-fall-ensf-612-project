I do think that there's something we can do to improve powershell here, but it's going to take a little bit of spec and design work. I can't speak for the team, but I expect that there are challenges in automatically expanding each system path entry _when redirection is enabled_ without breaking the \"run processes of the same bitness by default\" behavior.",
