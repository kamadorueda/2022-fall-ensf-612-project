It requires that one splat a single string as though it contained multiple arguments.\n\nPretty uncommon, especially given that the primary use case is for hashtable splatting, with array splatting being used by practically nobody.\n\nStill... Weird, I suppose, but you've not stored an array into the variable.\n\nIt's fairly common knowledge that PowerShell unwraps one-element arrays. The reason for that is down to how the pipeline works, fundamentally. It unwraps the array and sends each object down the pipeline, individually. As soon as this output begins being sent over a pipeline, the original array is gone. There is no data of whether it originated form a pipeline command, single input, array, whatever.\n\nThe only thing PS has to work with to determine the final shape of data once you start using a pipeline is the number of objects you're working with. Thus, one-element arrays are indistinguishable from a bare single object,",

A lot of non-Powershell executables rely on positional arguments, so maybe if you're only working within the domain of Powershell cmdlets and scripts it's unnecessary.\r\n\r\n> you've not stored the array into the variable\r\n\r\nHow would I do this? I thought `$x = @(\"foo\") | % { \"Hello, $_\" }` *was* storing the array into a variable. Just in case I tried `$x = @(\"foo\"); $result = $x | % { \"Hello, $_\" }; echo @result` to store stuff in variables extra hard, but that doesn't seem to work either. In the original use case the array (or apparently non-array, if single element) is `ConvertFrom-Json`-ed and stored into a variable, which is then splatted on the next line.\r\n\r\n> Thus, one-element arrays are indistinguishable from a bare single object\r\n\r\nYes, that is what this issue is about. Another way to put this is that one-element arrays don't exist at all. Most of PowerShell's machinery is therefore built to help non-array values pretend they're one-element arrays (e.g. `\"foo\".Count` is `1`), but in the case of `@` this falls apart.",
