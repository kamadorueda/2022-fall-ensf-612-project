    "body": "@mklement0 \r\n\r\n> it is a one-stop solution with more of a desired-state feel.\r\n\r\nYea, but stopping a service is NOT setting a service. We have specific verbs for that kind of action. if there is a current bug in how it operates, that should be fixed, but adding `-force` for `set-` to only affect the `stop` is ridiculous. We have the `stop` verb, use it for advanced stop functionality. If you can get away with basic stop on `set`, so be it, that's what `stop` is for. If I could go back in time I would say the `set` verb should not have had this functionality to begin with. if it did, then the `stop` verb should not have been included.\r\n\r\nOn your second point about `start-service`, I will say that `set` is _also_ not `start` and including it originally is silly, IMO. The correction there is to add a `-force` to `start` if it is not already there that enables the service if it is not disabled and starts any services it depends on. \r\n\r\nI'm just trying to keep things simple here and it seems like this PR is going in the wrong direction from simple. There is nothing wrong with doing something like `set-service @params -PassThru | stop-service` or `set-service @params -PassThru | start-service`. That keeps to the _do one thing_ philosophy. increasing complexity in a command to do another thing when there is another command that does that one thing is an odd design choice. (setting aside any perceived convenience in doing so). ",

    "body": "> however, not duplicating all the functionality seems silly,\r\n\r\nNo, it doesn't at all. `Set-` is for setting, `Stop-`  is for stopping. if the ability to stop on `set-` goes beyond anything basic, you should use `stop-`. The ability to stop on `set-` is a convenience that arguably should not be there (and I'm not advocating for its removal, for clarity).\r\n\r\nTell me, absent `-Status Stopped`, what purposed does `-Force` have? If I see `-Force` on `Set-Service` is expect it to allow me to force service settings. In this case, the only thing force is good for is stopping the service. We already  have `Stop-Service -Force` for that. For desired state, you are not likely going to be forcing the service to stop.  Again, this adds complexity and redundancy, and I'm arguing for simplicity.\r\n\r\nEdit: as a compromise, if everyone really thinks that having `set-` force stop a service is not as crazy as I think it is, how about `-Status StoppedForced` or something instead of `-Force` switch that only works for a specific single value on a single parameter?\r\n\r\n> Adding a -Force switch to Start-Service is not a solution, because there is no sensible default for the startup type that invariably has to change in that case \r\n\r\nI disagree, setting it to manual, when you are \"manually\" forcing the service to start certainly serves as a sensible setting. But this is a discussion for another time, lets not continue it in this thread.",
