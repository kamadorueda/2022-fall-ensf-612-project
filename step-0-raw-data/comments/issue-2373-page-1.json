So you should pick the solution that you think is more maintainable.\n\n`XmlWriter` make it easier to not generate any malformed XML queries, especially when the query is complex, but on the other hand it possibly will make the code less concise, for example, you may end up repeating following code snippet in many places. So if you decide to go with `XmlWriter`, please try avoid repeat as much as possible 😄 (for example, maybe put the code snippet below in a method that you can call whenever you need to generate a `<Query>` element)\n\n``` powershell\n$xmlWriter.WriteStartElement(\"QueryList\")\n$xmlWriter.WriteStartElement(\"Query\")\n$XmlWriter.WriteAttributeString(\"Id\", $Id.ToString())\n$XmlWriter.WriteAttributeString(\"Path\", $Path)\n\n$xmlWriter.WriteStartElement(\"Select\")\n$XmlWriter.WriteAttributeString(\"Path\", $Path)\n```\n",
