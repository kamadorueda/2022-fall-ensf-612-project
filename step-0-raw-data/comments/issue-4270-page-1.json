    "body": "> Another thoughts. Can we refactor the code\r\n\r\nI was thinking the same thing and working on a build to test the idea. I'm not sure your code snippet will quite work as it would still send the unhandled characters to the AssemblyName constructor which is what throws the error. But this should work:\r\n```CSharp\r\nstring assemblyName = ClrFacade.FIRST_CHAR_PSASSEMBLY_MARK + (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(rootAst.Extent.File)  \r\n                                          ? \"powershell\"  \r\n                                          : rootAst.Extent.File  \r\n\r\nvar assemblyNameObj = new AssemblyName(\"dummy\");\r\nassemblyNameObj .Name = assemblyName;\r\nvar assembly = AssemblyBuilder.DefineDynamicAssembly(assemblyNameObj, AssemblyBuilderAccess.RunAndCollect, GetAssemblyAttributeBuilders());\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt least, this would prevent the error when creating the AssemblyName. My question is whether creating the AssemblyName is the only place in the code that throws errors when the unhandled characters are used.",
