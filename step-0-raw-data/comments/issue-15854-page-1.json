I consider it a bit surprising, given that PowerShell behaves differently from `cmd` here.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's an issue, it could be an intended behavior, but I'd love to see it documented and hear a rationale for why it works this way. I don't see why I'd want to have a file type associated with a console application, but open it in a new console window.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the original purpose of PATHEXT is different (which extensions are looked up in PATH when a native command is specified without extension), and PowerShell adds a different, mostly unrelated purpose (which extensions open in the current console window), which is a bit odd.",

    "body": "The Engine WG discussed this issue today.  \r\n\r\nThe current behavior is by design however, we agree that documentation is needed (assuming it's not already documented in the help somewhere).\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nPowerShell is using `PATHEXT` to determine if a file is executable on Windows.  This usage is documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc737438(v=ws.10)) on the Microsoft Docs site.  It says:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177512/141396308-838d9011-166a-4619-ba26-941f2d0dab50.png)\r\n\r\nWhen PowerShell determines that a file is not executable then it hands it over to Windows via `ShellExecute = true` to process.  Windows handles looking up the file association and executing the default verb for the extension.  That may start Perl in a separate console, or open Excel with the given .xlsx file.\r\n\r\nThe prescribed solution for this is to add the extension to `PATHEXT`.  Of course, you can also invoke the interpreter directly e.g. `perl hello.pl`.  Note: once you've added `.PL` to `$env:PATHEXT`, you can invoke it with just `.\\hello` unless there is another `hello.bat|exe|com` in the same dir and those extensions appear before `.PL` in `PATHEXT`.",
