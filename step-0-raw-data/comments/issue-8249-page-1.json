Scenario: run two pwsh-s, one lock the config file, second is trying to access the file and - what? Wait and stop whole process? Currently we'll crash. On a system where many PowerShell processes run, this can cause unpredictable (rarely) crashes. (At minimum, we could not put an exclusive write lock.)",
