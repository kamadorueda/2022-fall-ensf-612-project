Some confusion, though. ðŸ™‚ \r\n\r\nThe `.Foreach()`\"magic\" method is only provided on objects that don't implement their own `.Foreach()` method; `System.Collections.Generic.List<T>` implements its own `Foreach()` method, so the magic method isn't available. You can check the overload definitions with `$list.Foreach`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOverloadDefinitions\r\n-------------------\r\nvoid ForEach(System.Action[System.Object] action)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout getting too deep into it, you _can_ use these in PS, but you need to be mindful of how they behave. `Action<T>` has _no return type_ (it's a `void` method with one input, effectively), so no matter what you do you can't get it to provide output / return values, the type is defined to provide no return value. Typically `Func` is used for actions with return values, if I recall correctly, but `Action` indicates no return value.\r\n\r\nAlso, when handling C# `Action` or `Func`, I don't believe `$_` is typically defined; you usually need to use `$args` to handle that, or provide a `param()` block in your scriptblock to handle the input parameters to the Action or Func. In other words, this \"works\" (but provides no output as mentioned before):\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\n$list.Foreach{ Write-Host $args[0] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomething you _can_ do is use the `ConvertAll()` method instead, which does permit output values, but you need to cast the argument to the correct type deliberately, since it's a generic method and PS can't resolve that one on its own currently. Again, check overloads with `$list.ConvertAll` to see what you're dealing with, and something like this will work:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\n# without param\r\n$list.ConvertAll([Converter[object, int]]{ $args[0] + 10 })\r\n\r\n# with param\r\n$list.ConvertAll(\r\n    [Converter[object,int]]{\r\n        param($item)\r\n        $item + 10\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n\r\n# both result in:\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n```",
