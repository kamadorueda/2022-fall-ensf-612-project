    "body": "@mikemaccana I find some of your points actually support the PowerShell team's decisions, actually.\n\nOffice and VSCode are graphical applications intended to be accessed and manipulated through a GUI shell. PowerShell is just that, another shell that also implements it's own language; it's NOT an app.\n\nOn every system except for NT, the user will be accessing pwsh the same as any other shell, via their terminal emulator, and that is the icon they will likely see (if using a GUI at all). The PowerShell Core icons in your GUI shell's path are just a courtesy shortcut, extra to any features of the project. On NT, try creating your own shortcut for conhost invocations, and be aware that changes are on the horizon for how that might work.\n\nThe point is, PowerShell Core's \"logo\" should be understood like Bash or Python's: It's just part of the project branding.\n\nHave a look at some other shell and language logos. Most of those projects, when packaged downstream, don't even distribute shortcuts for invoking their shells EXCEPT on NT.\n\nThe very nature of conforming to each platform suggests to me that it's worth considering getting rid of the shortcuts entirely at some point. It doesn't seem like the kind of thing that should be the PowerShell team's responsibility, and I assume these courtesy shortcuts are for ease of use to aid in adoption.\n\nRegardless, for intersystem maintainers, I wouldn't necessarily encourage any habits that rely on their form or function outside of teaching new users how to invoke other shells.",

There's just very obviously been different groups that have made different versions of the same logo and no effort to do as the issue title says.\r\n\r\nAs you say, Linux shells don't have icons because they're generally invoked via a terminal app. In Windows they're not invoked  this way. That supports having a properly maintained icon.\r\n\r\n**Let's kill the thread and I'll throw away the contribution.** These conversations - being gaslit into thinking there's actually a current consistent powershell icon and I just can't see it and this one and being told we should throw away all shell shortcuts - are inane and unpleasant. \r\n\r\nI've muted the thread and have unsubscribed.",
