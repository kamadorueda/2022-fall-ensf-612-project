    "body": "I can understand your pain and I have been caught out by this behaviour before as well.\r\n\r\nIf you simply remove the `[string]` type then it will work as expected:\r\n```\r\nfunction f2 {\r\n    param (\r\n        $x\r\n    )\r\n    return $x\r\n}\r\n$null -eq (f2 -x $null)\r\n```\r\nThere is no value in declaring a parameter as type string because all classes in .Net have to derive from the [Object ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object?view=netframework-4.7#remarks) class. Therefore every class implements `ToString()` and thus PowerShell would convert you every object to a string anyway.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are more complex scenarios such as e.g. passing `$null` into a method that got compiled in C# by PowerShell using `Add-Type`. In this scenario (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38958377/powershell-null-is-not-null-any-more-when-calling-into-c-sharp-code) for my SO question last year)\r\nThe workaround for this is to use the [NullString](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.management.automation.language.nullstring.value(v=vs.85).aspx) class that got introduced in PowerShell v3 and pass in `[NullString]::Value`\r\n\r\nAlthough I would also upvote if it is possible to improve it going forward, this will be up to the MSFT guys since this could be quite a big breaking change and given the fact that the NullString class got introduced in v3 suggests to me that they were aware of this but did not want to make the breaking change back then. But maybe now is the time where this breaking change would not hurt as much as it would've been in previous versions?",

    "body": ">...I do think it would be hard to take advantage of it in a useful way.\r\n\r\nI disagree.  Allowing `[NullString]::Value` to propagate without conversion to `[string]::empty` is useful when optional string parameters are handled in bulk using either `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName` or via hashtable splatting.  Here is an example using the former demonstrating parameter passing that arises naturally when working with class-based DscResources:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nclass SomeDscResource\r\n{\r\n    #[DscResource()]\r\n    [string]$a = [NullString]::Value\r\n    [string]$b = [NullString]::Value\r\n    [string]$c = [NullString]::Value\r\n    # ...\r\n\r\n    [void] Set () {\r\n        $this | Set-SomeConfiguration\r\n    }\r\n    # ...\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Set-SomeConfiguration\r\n{\r\n    param\r\n    (\r\n        [Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true)]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $a,\r\n\r\n        [Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true)]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $b,\r\n\r\n        [Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true)]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $c\r\n\r\n        #...\r\n    )\r\n    process\r\n    {\r\n        foreach ( $paramName in $PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.BoundParameters.Keys )\r\n        {\r\n            Write-Host \"Parameter $paramName : \" -NoNewline\r\n            switch ( Get-Variable $paramName -ValueOnly )\r\n            {\r\n                ($null)               { Write-Host \"do nothing\"; break }\r\n                ([NullString]::Value) { Write-Host \"do nothing\"; break }\r\n                ([string]::Empty)     { Write-Host \"clear\" } \r\n                Default               { Write-Host \"set to $paramName\"}\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the resource needs to be set, `.a`, `.b`, and `.c` are optionally assigned and `.Set()` is called:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$rsrcObj = [SomeDscResource]::new()\r\n$rsrcObj.a = 'desired value'\r\n$rsrcObj.b = [string]::Empty\r\n$rsrcObj.Set()\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently that outputs\r\n\r\n```\r\nParameter a : set to a\r\nParameter b : clear\r\nParameter c : clear\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is incorrect for `c` as it was not assigned and should be left untouched.  Rather, the result should be as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\nParameter a : set to a\r\nParameter b : clear\r\nParameter c : do nothing\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be achieved today by omitting the `[string]` static type in all functions that might have bulk properties passed in one of such ways.  That, however, requires that all future maintainers and creators of all functions that accept such `[string]` parameters be aware that a statically-typed `[string]` parameter behaves fundamentally different from all other types with respect to `$null`.  In real DSC resources with reasonably-factored code, it is usual that parameters pass through several functions before use.  It seems unrealistic to expect that static-typing as `[string]` is omitted (but static-typing for any other type is permitted) at each of those sites.  \r\n\r\nIt seems more realistic, however, to write a comment about the merits of `[NullString]::value` over `$null` at the few sites where the default values for the parameters object or hashtable are set.  \r\n\r\nIn other words, if `[NullString]::Value` could be passed to `[string]` parameters unaltered, the pain of `$null` conversion to `[string]::empty` could be managed once where the parameter is created (or at the module boundary) rather than at every possible site where such a parameter might be passed to a parameter statically-typed as `[string]`.\r\n",

Then it would just be a matter of using that string type where the typical behavior involving `null` is needed.  I have been experimenting with introducing such a type.  The preliminary results are promising.  \r\n\r\nIf you're interested, an example is in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/alx9r/fec92c03387d694ad2b9dee48cd7d4be).  I've implemented `IEquatable` and `IComparable` and it seems to work well in contexts that rely on those interfaces, and it doesn't have the painful properties related to `$null`.  I'm interested in what you think.",
