First, you don't have to quote:\r\n```\r\n06-26 15:59:29 13> cd c:\\program files\r\nC:\\program files\r\n```\r\nSecond, if the path is a file path then it will cd to the directory containing the file which is nice for:\r\n```\r\n06-26 15:59:33 14> cd $profile\r\n~\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\r\n```\r\nThis last feature would be a breaking change I suppose so may not be viable but I can tell you that for interactive use, it is very nice.  :-)\r\n",

To get rid of quotes are you suggesting parser magic? Or simply making `Set-Location` varags and concatenating the strings with a space between them? (Which will work in most cases but not all). With respect to parent directory vs leaf, in my `cd` function, I have a switch `-Parent` that lops of the leaf node of the path. It's handy.",
