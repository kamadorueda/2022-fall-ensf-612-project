    "body": "It would be nice for PowerShell 7 users to be able to use those directly. Is there any chance for some of those to be returned into PowerShell 7?\r\n\r\nAnd by now I hope that PowerShell 7.0 is feature complete - so except for making the error messages more actionable when using these commands, I'd not want more to go into PowerShell 7.0. For example:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\foo> enable-computerrestore\r\nenable-computerrestore: The term 'enable-computerrestore' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [4,General]: The most similar commands are: Enable-ComputerRestore, Disable-ComputerRestore.\r\n```\r\nor\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\foo> start-transaction\r\nstart-transaction: The term 'start-transaction' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [1,Transactions]: Once a transaction is started, only commands that get called with the -UseTransaction flag become part of that transaction.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [4,General]: The most similar commands are: Start-Transaction, Start-Transcript, Get-Transaction, Set-DtcTransaction, Use-Transaction, Undo-Transaction, Get-DtcTransaction.\r\n```\r\nSaying a command is not recognised then suggersting you use that very same command is really a poor experience. IMHO this really needs to be addressed before 7.0 RTM. \r\n",
