In PowerShell itself, the work that strips off the ANSI code is done in ConsoleHost, and that makes it necessary for other host to do something similar.\r\n\r\nBut you made me start to think, maybe that's not the right design, maybe that should be done in formatting before sending the payload to host ... there could be other applications that hosts PowerShell out there in the wild, and requiring extra work to their host after upgrading to PS 7.2 is not a pleasant ask for sure.\r\n\r\nWe may want to rethink about where to strip off the ANSI code. Does this work have to be done in host implementation? If not, it's better to do it in PowerShell formatting, so various hosts out in the wild don't need to change for `$PSStyle` to work properly when upgrading to PS 7.2+.",

    "body": "@theJasonHelmick  What troubles me here is:  Is .NET  interactive the only host with any meaningful user-base which needs to take on the extra work to integrate with PowerShell, or are there a few, or potentially many ? For small numbers filing an issue with them is the right course. For large numbers the solution should be coming from the PowerShell team. I don't know of any others so I'm happy with this marked as external and closed, at least for now.  We **may** need to re-visit but no sense it getting overly worried because it is more likely we won't. \r\n,\r\n ",
