Both the expression interpreter and the COM binder code are archived components in .NET, there is no activity in those components (except for the needed changes to get them in .NET Core/5.0).\r\n2. It's not a sheer copy of the .NET code. There are additional PowerShell specific changes to those code in PowerShell repo.

It doesn't imply `obsolete` -- bringing back COM binder in .NET 5.0 is a clear evidence that the com binder is supported.\r\n\r\nFor the expression interpreter, `System.Linq.Expression` and `Microsoft.CSharp` are where the code lives, and they are now the archived components. But those 2 libraries are obviously important building blocks for many other components.\r\n\r\nHere is the area doc if you are interested: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/area-owners.md",
