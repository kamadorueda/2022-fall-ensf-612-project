    "body": "> But I'd love someone who knows to explain how we ended up in this mess.\r\n\r\nSo the big difference is that `-as [string]` is compiled as:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nTypeOps.AsOperator(DateTime.Now, Fake.Const<Type>(typeof(string)));\r\n```\r\n\r\nand `[string][datetime]::Now` is compiled as:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nFake.Dynamic<Func<CallSite, DateTime, string>>(PSConvertBinder.Get(typeof(string)))(DateTime.Now);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow both `AsOperator` and `PSConvertBinder` end up calling `LanguagePrimitivies.FigureConversion`, they both receive the same `IConversionData` and invoke it. The difference is the `IFormatProvider` specified. `-as` will use `NumberFormatInfo.InvariantInfo` and an explicit conversion will specify `null` (I stopped following around here, but I'm guessing somewhere down the line the `null` is replaced with `CultureInfo.InvariantInfo`).\r\n\r\nNow why is it different? ðŸ¤· probably an oversight. Would be easy to make. Ideally they'd both just call the binder and the binder would just have an option for \"defaultOnError\" or something like that.",
