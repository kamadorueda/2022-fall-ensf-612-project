    "body": "Hi @huigguijt \r\n\r\nI've had a look into this and the root cause is that this is an issue with the `PowerShellGet` Module & specifically the `v1.0.0.1` version of the module which is the default version available on all versions of Windows that it has been included with. On looking at the source code for this module across a number of my machines this parameter doesn't exist in this version.\r\nI dug into the history of the [PowerShellGet Module](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGetv2/) and found that to use that parameter you will need to update PowerShellGet to version `2.1.5`.\r\n\r\nThat fixes your issue however raises a question that I am going to pass to the documentation team as current documentation only shows the latest version and not historic versions.",
