So it would take a little bit of work to do that.\r\n- Either way, the only way to support debugging on Linux is to release a whole new Debug build, which would be considerably more work.\r\n\r\nSo it may be possible for us to generate and publish PDBs on Windows only, but two counter points are:\r\n- Debugging support wouldn't be cross platform\r\n- Being open source, it's relatively straightforward to get a Debug build the old fashioned way\r\n\r\n@powercode I'm guessing the main reason for wanting PDBs of published releases is to do performance analysis on optimised (i.e. crossgenned) builds?",
