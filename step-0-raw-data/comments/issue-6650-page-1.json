    "body": "Hi Steve, thanks for getting back to me on this. I've configured SSHD not to use password auth but keys only. It's working well for me, it's just the initial/first connection when I build up a new VM from a template. I can script around this using a combination of adjusting the known_hosts files, ssh-keyscan and the linux style Expect command. IMO it would be good to have an easier option to get round this issue, either a new command like Expect or perhaps a Force parameter that would bypass any issues with the known_hosts file or the initial prompt for connecting first time? Thanks again",

There are [articles](https://linuxcommando.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-to-disable-ssh-host-key-checking.html) on how to suppress host key checking which is a VERY bad security practice as it opens you up to man-in-the-middle attacks.  If you are in a trusted environment, then I suppose you could use the trick in that article with just `ssh` first so that the host is \"trusted\" then use PowerShell remoting over SSH.",

After reading the article that you referred to and also this one:\r\nhttps://serverfault.com/questions/132970/can-i-automatically-add-a-new-host-to-known-hosts\r\n\r\nI think I can achieve what I need to do by using the below 2 additional lines of code in my pwsh script:\r\n\r\n ssh-keygen -R [ip_address] (removes entry from the known_hosts file)\r\n ssh-keyscan -H [ip_address] >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts (adds an entry to known hosts file)\r\n\r\n invoke-command -hostname (Connect to the host without prompting for the fingerprint)\r\n\r\nThis should resolve my automated deployment issue, I will test it shortly...\r\n\r\nPerhaps a force command to bypass the 2 other steps would be good option? Not sure. I guess see how much interest there is in this post.\r\n\r\nThanks again Steve,\r\nSteve",
