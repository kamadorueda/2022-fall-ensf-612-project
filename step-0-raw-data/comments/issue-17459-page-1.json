    "body": "I don't think so. Interestingly creating a variable with an explicit scope modifier of `private` without the Set-Variable cmdlet behaves in a similar way to using `-Option Private` and not `-Scope Private` nor `-Visibility Private`.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $private:thing = 1\r\n> & { $thing }\r\n\r\n> $thing\r\n1\r\n> & { Get-Variable thing -Scope 1 }\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nthing                          1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, it's private to the specific scope that created it, and normal variable discovery can't find it. But if you target the correct scope value explicitly, you can find it from any other scope.\r\n\r\nSo depending on which `Private` option you pick, it has a completely different meaning. I think it might be worth having the Language WG discuss this one and what the intended behaviour for each of these \"Private\" things is. In my opinion, there seems to be some design confusion here that needs straightened out.",

    "body": "> There's still confusion between the Private option on Set-Variable, which behaves that way to the private scope itself, which is (currently) a valid option on New-Variable which seemingly does nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nAIUI - and what `about_scope`  seems to say  re private is  - although `$private:`  looks like a scope qualifier, it isn't..    `$Anything:Something`  seems to treat \"anything\" as a PS Drive _except for the special cases_ `Global`, `Script`, `Local` and `Private`. `$C:SomeName` gets the contents of a file with no extension in the current directory of C:  - if one exists. `$0:someName` returns nothing unless you create a drive \"0\" and the file exists in the current directory - it can't be used to access scope 0, 1 , 2... that needs to go through `*-Variable` .  Of the four special cases 3 are scopes and one applies a label. I guess it is a bit like `$env:` in some ways that's like a scope, but really it's a drive. \r\n\r\nAnd the \"Seemingly doing nothing\" is plain weird. \r\n\r\n```\r\n>  new-variable -Name one -Value \"222\" -scope Two\r\nNew-Variable: Cannot process argument because the value of parameter \"Scope\" is not valid. Valid values are \"Global\", \"Local\", or \"Script\",\r\n```\r\n\r\n`New-Variable` _accepts_ `private` in the scope parameter, but if you enter something random, it gives a list of valid scopes, which excludes `private`\r\n\r\n> And then the Private -Visibility option which does something else entirely. It's all a bit of a tangled web here.\r\n\r\nIndeed it is :-) \r\n",
