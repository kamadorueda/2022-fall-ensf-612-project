    "body": "This does not reproduce in 6.0.1. I believe starting with 6.0.0 (#5292) the assembly name for PowerShell generated dynamic Classes and Enums changed which resolved this issue. To be clear, in 5.1 the dynamic class assembly names were generated based on the filename. Creating an `Enum` from a file with an illegal assembly name character is likely the cause of the issue you see.\r\n\r\nThis repository is for PowerShell Core 6.0.0 and newer. To file bug reports for Windows PowerShell 5.1 please use [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)",
