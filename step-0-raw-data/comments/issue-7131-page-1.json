The only alternative seems to be priming a new runspace with modules for each test.  But I've found that to be much too expensive for script modules.\r\n\r\n>...it should be fairly easy to add the property to RunspacePool and reset the runspace state when it's allocated.

But I'm not quite sure yet whether I can use RunspacePools; I'm still seeing a performance disadvantage during module loading when compared with `Runspace.OpenAsync()` (see also #7035). ",
