So for instance:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Result = pwsh -OutputFormat Xml -Command Get-Typo | Where Text -eq \"X\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou expect a `#< CLIXML` header to mean the output gets converted to objects and you'll capture it in `$Result`, but in this case you get a spew of XML because the command is not found... It might take you a while to realize that `pwsh` (or `PowerShell`, because this has always been like this) has produced all this output on stderr, and the hosting instance doesn't deserialize stderr output, even if it _does_ have the CLIXML header.\r\n\r\nNOTE: You can work around this by redirecting the other stream to stdout ... but then it's all co-mingled...",
