In this sense, patch releases are much more important than major version releases to the people seeing them. To this end, I would imagine there are many users who are on PS 7 LTS who don't want a notification for PS 7.1 or 8, but who really need to see one for PS 7.0.1. I believe this is exactly how the LTS update channel is configured to function currently.\r\n\r\nI think the assumption in the issue here is that bigger version increment means that there's more goodness means that you should be more likely to upgrade. But really it's the opposite. Smaller version increment means more relevant to your current installation means you have more to gain and less to lose by upgrading.\r\n\r\nThe version update notification isn't marketing, it's PowerShell's current solution to the update problem given that its installation is managed in different ways across different platforms.",

It basically presumes you installed with the MSI. ~~On macOS and Linux it just reminds you; it won't try and run a package manager update for you~~ on macOS it will run homebrew, and I’m not sure about Linux. But I don't think it's configured to work with an MSIX or .pkg installation. And detecting how you installed after installation is the hard part",

I would prefer to see more in json and less in environments variables.",
