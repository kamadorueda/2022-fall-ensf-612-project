When the actual command line is being built it has a check on the argumentlist [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/58c371ca31d9e1b72da5d94821f2d670da5b4dfa/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/Process.cs#L2313-L2317). At this particular point in time `arguments` is equals to `' '` which is neither null or an empty string so it is appended to the command line to run. What I don't understand is why there's only 1 space, there should be 2 based on the assumption above. I don't have access to my dev environment so I can't step into the code to 100% check this but I don't think the issue lies in .NET but rather in PowerShell.\r\n\r\n",
