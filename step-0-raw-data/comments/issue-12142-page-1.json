    "body": "This is an issue with the module itself and the API it's trying to use, which is simply not available on all platforms, and it appears it's not available or at least functional in .NET Core at all. As a result, it's not going to be properly compatible with pwsh. If the API is not available in .NET Core, they'll need to find an alternative way to handle that authentication method.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure which command you're using, it's obscured in the screenshot, but you'll need to file this issue on [the module's repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell); there's nothing PowerShell itself can do about the .NET APIs that a module chooses to use.",
