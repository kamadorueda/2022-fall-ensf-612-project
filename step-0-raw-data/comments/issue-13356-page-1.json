This occurs for the child processes, where the entry is still needed to allow the parent process to read its child's exit status: once the exit status is read via the wait system call, the zombie's entry is removed from the process table and it is said to be \"reaped\".\r\n\r\nI think we probably just need to call [waitpid](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/wait.2.html) after the ssh process is terminated.

    "body": "I found more information about the Ctrl+C / SIGINT behaviour in a regular SSH session here: https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-client-signal-handling/\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that in a regular OpenSSH session, the client does not ignore but forwards the signals to the remote host. This effectively means the OpenSSH client does not process the signal for itself, I tried doing Ctrl+C multiple times locally and it wouldn't kill the OpenSSH client. This appears to be close to the approach taken by PowerShell: it spawns the OpenSSH client process but makes it ignore the signals so the PowerShell client can forward them over PSRP to the remote host.\r\n\r\nThe main issue I see with the current code is that the defunct ssh processes remain until the parent process (pwsh) is killed. This can be very problematic when spawning multiple PowerShell sessions within the same pwsh process, because you would get a defunct ssh process for each.\r\n\r\nOther people have suggested calling waitpid, which is normally a blocking call. [There is a WNOHANG flag that can be passed to waitpid](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Process-Completion.html), but we'd have to look into how portable this flag is (is it only with a Linux glibc?).\r\n\r\nIn all cases, I think attempts to fix this would need to be added in the part of code called when the PowerShell remoting session is freed. Can anybody point to where that would be? The code creating the ssh process is easy to find, but it is not so clear to me where the code freeing the PowerShell remoting session for SSH is being called. The goal would be to call some cleanup code at that point in time where we are sure that the ssh process should either be cleaned up if defunct, or force killed if still there.\r\n\r\nThis procedure would attempt the following, in order:\r\n- waitpid + WNOHANG for a defunct process\r\n- force kill process (SIGKILL) if process is \"alive\"\r\n\r\nForce killing the process is obvious the last resort, but it shouldn't happen under normal circumstances, it's just there to ensure we clean up the process in all possible cases. Most of the time, we would just find the defunct process and clean it up by calling waitpid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://goteleport.com/gravitational/images/backgrounds/earth.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-client-signal-handling/\">Chasing missing SIGINT signals - SSH</a></strong></div><div>This post is the first of an ongoing series about interesting issues and bugs that the Teleport team has worked on.
