    "body": "I'm unsure. Can we tag this for committee review, please?\r\n\r\nLet me explain as best I can. @SeeminglyScience may be able to explain the bits I'm not especially clear on, I'm painfully aware I don't have a thorough understanding of everything that's going on.\r\n\r\n1. **Currently**, our detection of mutable value types is simply broken. There's no other conclusion in my mind, it's literally completely broken;\r\n2. Any but the very simplest and most basic structs will register as mutable and end up being copied unnecessarily, so we're wasting a decent amount of cycles copying value types we simply don't need to.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis is complicated by the fact that one of the methods that are using this mutable struct detection method treats them more differently than it should. In short:\r\n\r\n1. If it reads the value type as mutable, it _unwraps PSObjects_ as part of the copy operation before passing it along to whatever's using it, and it is never rewrapped before being handed back.\r\n    - I don't understand the full implications of this, but as I understand it this will cause performance degradation since there are many times we have to then look up the PSObject wrapper for that struct value/instance from the resurrection tables.\r\n2. It doesn't do that for immutable structs, so these end up remaining wrapped in PSObject.\r\n\r\nSo, in other words... whether a struct is considered mutable or not (and we have a _lot_ of false positives) determines whether we waste potentially quite a lot of cycles looking up PSObject wrappers in the resurrection table for it _repeatedly_.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm of the opinion this should just be fixed; both code paths should be returning values the same way. Not sure if that should be wrapped or not, but both should be the same. Currently I'd say that ensuring all structs returned should be returned wrapped as that'll result in better performance overall.\r\n\r\n_But_ since most structs currently are (incorrectly) registered as mutable, they end up being returned unwrapped. So some compiled cmdlets may notice the change -- actually, that's what's causing the CI failures. It's expecting a raw DateTime value when it should be checking for PSObject wrappers and grabbing the base object out of it to get the DateTime value. I don't know how long it's worked like this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, It's a little bit of an edge case for cmdlets to ever notice the difference; in order to see this difference, you have to be taking as input some kind of object that has `DateTime` as a type-unrestricted property. If you take in `DateTime` as a parameter value, you'll never see this difference, it will always be unwrapped by the time you see it. The cmdlet in the repo that is registering this change accepts a PSObject as input and expects a `DateTime` property on it; handling this the way that seems sensible currently breaks that as it ends up with a `PSObject` wrapped around it in that instance.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm also going to tag @daxian-dbw for review as well. In my opinion, this is reasonably safe to change and save the performance cycles, but I'm also aware that it is a potentially noticeable change to the way this works, and it may break some compiled cmdlets that expect (for example) PSCustomObject / PSObject as input data, with one of the values being a struct that currently is incorrectly considered mutable.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that's a long and potentially unclear explanation, please ask if you have any questions, I'll attempt to clarify as best I can. 💖 ",

    "body": "@vexx32 did a great job at explaining but let me try to summarize with an example\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Current behavior that incorrectly detects DateTime as mutable\r\n(Get-Date) -is [psobject]\r\n# True\r\n$a = Get-Date\r\n$a -is [psobject]\r\n# False\r\n\r\n# Fixed behavior\r\n(Get-Date) -is [psobject]\r\n# True\r\n$a = Get-Date\r\n$a -is [psobject]\r\n# True\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way that copy semantics are implemented, the `PSObject` is unwrapped, the struct is unboxed and boxed again, but **never rewrapped**.  In PowerShell this is meaningless, but a PowerShell aware (or focused) C# API may expect that a mutable struct (or rather, any non-primitive value type because detection is busted) will never be wrapped in a `PSObject`.  Personally I think such an API should *always* account for `PSObject`, but it's easy to imagine this behavior being accidently depended on.  Especially since PowerShell has at least one example of this.\r\n\r\nTechnically this behavior is undocumented and arguably not part of the breaking change contract, but it's also quite difficult to know exactly what the impact would be.  I do think it's worth the change though.  I'd also like to bring up the possibility of adding a rewrap step in the copy semantics if the mutable struct was originally wrapped in a `PSObject` (though maybe better suited for a new issue).",

I'm all for making the _changes_ piecemeal if we can, but I don't think a meaningful decision can be had unless we have a plan to act on already in place.\r\n\r\nIf we were going to do this piecemeal, I'd recommend this:\r\n\r\n1. Improve copy semantics & rewrapping in PSObject\r\n2. Improve mutable struct detection to avoid extraneous copies.\r\n\r\nNote that even doing the first step would immediately cause the same potential breakage as actually fixing the issue, without the perf fixes/improvements.",

This could break some scenarios where a C# API traverses a psobject with a property containing one of these structs.\r\n\r\nFor example, a API like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbool HasModifiedTime(PSObject pso)\r\n{\r\n     return pso.Properties[\"ModifiedTime\"]?.Value is DateTime;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nShould instead look like:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbool HasModifiedTime(PSObject pso)\r\n{\r\n    var value = pso.Properties[\"ModifiedTime\"]?.Value;\r\n    return value is PSObject inner\r\n        ? inner.BaseObject is DateTime\r\n        : value is DateTime;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr really most cases will look something like (which will still work):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nbool GetModifiedTime(PSObject pso)\r\n{\r\n    return LanguagePrimitives.ConvertTo<DateTime>(pso.Properties[\"ModifiedTime\"]?.Value);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically, is this change acceptable given that most code will (or should) look like the second or third example?
