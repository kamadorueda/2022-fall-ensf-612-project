    "body": "Thanks, @dragonwolf83 - I forgot about the many subtleties of `-ExpandProperty`.\r\n\r\nThe current `Select-Object` docs are woefully inadequate (incomplete, and partially misleading).\r\n\r\nHere's what actually happens, and from that perspective the behavior is consistent in all 3 cases you mention:\r\n\r\n* The single property you pass to `-ExpandProperty` becomes the _output type_. That is, instances of whatever type the referenced property is are output.\r\n\r\n* Any properties you pass to `-Property` are _added as  note properties_ to those output-type instances.\r\n\r\n  * If the `-ExpandProperty` property is a _collection_, the note properties are added to _each element_ of that collection (and the collection is invariably converted to `[object[]]` on output).  \r\n\r\n  * Often, the output formatting may not show these note properties, which makes it _look_ like they're not there (ignored), but they are.\r\n\r\nIn short: The real problem is one of _poor documentation_, and I'll add an issue in the docs repo.\r\n\r\n",
