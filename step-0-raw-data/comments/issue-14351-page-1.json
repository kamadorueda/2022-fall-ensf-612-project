It looks like it was originally written for PowerShell v2 where you could only redirect the error or output pipe so having a flag to indicate `Error | Output` made sense in some situations. When the other streams were added they were added as an enum like value and the methods were updated to treat them as such. Thereâ€™s a few instances where I found this enum type being used in different ways and itâ€™s ultimately typically because the methods were designed for different PowerShell versions.",

Makes me wonder if they gave up on that once they noticed they declared the enum wrong ðŸ¤· ",
