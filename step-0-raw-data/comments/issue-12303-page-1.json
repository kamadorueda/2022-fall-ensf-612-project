    "body": "In addition, the above example is using a range operator just for Event IDs (1..24).  However, as \"Get-WinEvent\" is dealing with Event Logs, the range operator may be used for other things that need to be longer as well.  For example, when looking at Windows Firewall event logs, it could be looking at a range of Source/Destination Port numbers.\r\n\r\nTo give an example, when using \"-FilterXML\" – rather than \"-FilterHashtable\" – it's possible to have multiple specific suppress filters, which allows creating a whitelist (collect all the events and then whitelist by suppressing the ones you don't want to see), however with \"-FilterHashtable\" that doesn't appear to be possible in the same way.\r\n\r\nUsing \"-FilterXML\" it will look something like this:\r\n\r\nPS1 File:\r\n[02 Firewall - FilterXML.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/4470655/02.Firewall.-.FilterXML.zip)\r\n![Screenshot 02 (Firewall - FilterXML)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27423064/79141223-3f208280-7db1-11ea-9791-95fcf01c1acf.png)\r\n\r\nUsing \"-FilterHashtable\", something similar can be achieved by doing something like this:\r\n\r\nPS1 File:\r\n[03 Firewall - Hashtable 01.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/4470670/03.Firewall.-.Hashtable.01.zip)\r\n![Screenshot 03 (Firewall - Hashtable 01)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27423064/79141326-80189700-7db1-11ea-9763-da93a223aea4.png)\r\n\r\nHowever, when using \"-FilterHashtable\", the problem is when you need to suppress firewall events where it's not possible to suppress a particular \"DestPort\" (like old delayed replies from DNS servers – as they are replying to random destination ports in the 49152–65535 range, rather than a specific port).  \r\n\r\n![Screenshot 04 (Firewall - Hashtable 01)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27423064/79141408-a50d0a00-7db1-11ea-8ff6-ccf43a5a21be.png)\r\n\r\nIf you try to add a another field (such as \"SourcePort\") to be suppressed as well, this won't work because the event would need to have both one of the values in the \"DestPort\" and also one of the values in \"SourcePort\" in order for it to be suppressed.  As this isn't the case for most of the events, it will return almost the whole inbound event log:\r\n\r\nPS1 File:\r\n[05 Firewall - Hashtable 02.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/4470678/05.Firewall.-.Hashtable.02.zip)\r\n![Screenshot 05 (Firewall - Hashtable 02)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27423064/79141525-e4d3f180-7db1-11ea-9104-677a8c5cca6e.png)\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to use the 49152..65535 range operator.  Although not ideal, I'm unable to find another way.  However, due to the hashtable arrays being limited, this won't work either.  At least it is something I wanted to try; I don't know what the performance would be like if it did work:\r\n\r\nPS1 File:\r\n[06 Firewall - Hashtable 03.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/4470695/06.Firewall.-.Hashtable.03.zip)\r\n![Screenshot 06 (Firewall - Hashtable 03)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27423064/79141728-45632e80-7db2-11ea-94a1-05918c12a76d.png)\r\n\r\n",
