    "body": "> How should conflicting type aliases work? Consider the following example:\r\n> \r\n> ```\r\n> using namespace System.Timers\r\n> using type Timer = string\r\n> [Timer] #What type is this?\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> In the above example, `Timer` can either be `System.Timers.Timer` or `System.String`.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I didn't write much down (beyond the code you salvaged), but I remember testing different constraint models and made some observations, I've tried compiling them here. I haven't had time to play around with code or do a full review yet, so it's entirely possible I've listed or highlighted things below that you've already addressed :) \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThere are several distinct types of conflict you need to keep in mind (examples below):\r\n\r\n - Parse time conflicts (these should all be treated as parse-time errors and handled in the parser/compiler pipeline):\r\n   - Conflicting type aliases\r\n   - Conflicting namespace aliases\r\n   - Conflicting aliases (any kind) and runtime-defined type (`enum`, `class`, hereinafter referred to as PSType)\r\n - Runtime conflicts (should be handled primarily though ordered resolution, with exceptions)\r\n   - Single-lable type name resolves to multiple imported namespaces or an alias (**this one** is your example)\r\n   - Qualified type names resolve to multiple types when factoring in namespaces imported or aliases (I'll cover this in a subsequent comment, I need some sleep first 😅 )\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'm going to assume the following constraint throughout (please implement test cases for this!):\r\n - Alias names are _single-label names_ - `using {type,namespace} A` is a valid pattern but `using {type,namespace} A.B` should never be allowed. This ensures we never have to worry about conflicts between namespaces and type aliases, since namespaces are always used as _qualifiers_ in type literals. \r\n\r\nI'll start with your example and circle back to the conflicts that should fail compilation below:\r\n\r\n## Precedence order for resolving single-label type names\r\n\r\nI remember briefly discussing the design intentions with @lzybkr at some point, and the idea was indeed to let type aliases take precedence - similar to command discovery precedence where aliases hide other commands of the same name - so we would have the following resolution order:\r\n\r\n 1. type alias\r\n 2. PSType\r\n 3. type accelerator\r\n 4. imported namespace \r\n 5. default discovery/`usedSystem`\r\n\r\nSo, `using type Timer = string` takes precedence and as a result, \r\n - `[Timer] -eq [string]`, (rank 1)\r\n - `[ElapsedEventArgs] -eq [System.Timers.ElapsedEventArgs]` (rank 4)\r\n - `[System.Timers.Timer]` remains unaffected (would have been resolved by rank 4, but hidden by `[Timer]` alias at rank 1)\r\n\r\nTo illustrate what PSType vs namespace looks like:\r\n```\r\nusing namespace System.Timers\r\n\r\nclass Timer\r\n{\r\n  [string] ToString() { return \"Not the timer you're looking for\" }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere, `[Timer]` should always and unambiguously refer to the local `class Timer {...}` type - type resolver shouldn't \"reach\" rank 4 and search `[System.Timers]` because `[Timer]` was resolved at rank 2\r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n## Parse time conflicts\r\n\r\nI believe we should never encourage _intentional ambiguity_, the same way we don't allow conflicting member names or ambiguous local variable names in PSType definitions. \r\n\r\n### Aliases\r\n\r\nEncountering any of the following in the same scriptblock/file should result in compilation failure (at the latest):\r\n```\r\nusing type A = string\r\nusing type A = int\r\n```\r\n```\r\nusing namespace A = B.C\r\nusing namespace A = D.E\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'd argue the following statement should _not necessarily be considered invalid_, as there's no proven technical ambiguity at this point in time, but it _is_ confusing to read:\r\n ```\r\n using type A = string\r\n using namespace A = B.C\r\n ```\r\n\r\n### Conflicting aliases and PSType\r\n\r\nConflicts between `using` aliases and PSTypes should also result in a parse-time error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing type A = string\r\n\r\nclass A { ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe following should also throw an error if classes.psm1 contains a PSType definition with name `A`, but we will probably have to delay this check until late in the compilation pipeline (just before, or during PSType generation likely):\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing type A = string\r\nusing module classes.psm1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't cover _every_ facet of resolution across different types of qualifiers but hopefully this should be enough to help you decide on approach to resolution order, and start _writing some tests_! 😉 \r\n",

There's no syntactical concept of individual members (nor their generic type parameter arguments) in the context of `using` statements so this feature never touches your member parsing and resolution logic, and your feature simply need the type resolution API to remain stable (which is the case after this change).",

    "body": "Thanks for your thoughts @IISResetMe I've added parsing errors for conflicting aliases and type definitions.\r\nI've also allowed type aliases to take priority over using namespaces again.\r\n```\r\nusing namespace System.Timers\r\nusing type Timer = string\r\n[Timer] #Resolves to System.String due to the alias, and not System.Timers.Timer\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I've also made a breaking change by making duplicate namespaces like:\r\n```\r\nusing namespace System.Management.Automation.Language\r\nusing namespace System.Management.Automation.Language\r\n```\r\na parsing error. Currently it's allowed, but if you try to actually use a type from that namespace you get a runtime error like this: `Type name 'Token' is ambiguous, it could be 'System.Management.Automation.Language.Token' or 'System.Management.Automation.Language.Token'.` I can limit it to duplicate namespace aliases only but I think the odds of this breaking change affecting any real world scripts seem low enough that it's worth keeping.",

PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detected.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiTWFydGluR0M5NCIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNjczNCIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic1VwIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiTWFydGluR0M5NCIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNjczNCIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6Ik5ldXRyYWwifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiTWFydGluR0M5NCIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNjczNCIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic0Rvd24ifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",
