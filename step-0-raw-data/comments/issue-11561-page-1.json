    "body": "Interesting idea, but we'd need to properly define how this would really work for PS. You can already do things like `$var = try { get-content -erroraction stop -path $nonexistentFile } catch { \"fallback value\" }` so this would essentially be some kind of shortcut for this syntax, though I'm not clear on what that fallback would be here?\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear how this would behave with subexpressions or pipelines -- would this simply swallow any errors that occur for the duration of the entire expression?\r\n\r\nFinally, I don't think `!` is a great choice for the operator; it reminds far too much of the `!=` operator for C# in your example syntax, which is `-ne` in PS.
