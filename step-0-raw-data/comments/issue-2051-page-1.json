We like fixing typos, but 650+ commits is a bit much, you could squash those, or we'd probably squash before merging.\n\nI did notice changing a resource name. Often that seems like a safe change (not a public api), but we do use some of those names in error messages. Again, that also seems like a safe change, but it can be useful to leave the typo as is assuming the error has been posted somewhere, e.g. Stack Overflow - that way searching for an error isn't as dependent on what version of PowerShell you used.\n\nIf you do submit a bigger PR, consider submitting a single PR for fixes to comments only, maybe another that changes code, and you could break the changes in code up a bit too, e.g. changing assertion text, changing resource names, etc.\n",

    "body": "@jianyunt : can I please get a pass on fixing the other thing? I promise it's in the bigger series (it's closer to 1000 at this point).\n\n@lzybkr : I have done splits like that in the past. It's definitely doable. And I can definitely squash things once people decide what/how. I prefer not to squash initially because it makes it painful to handle rebases. And yes, I understand the idea of keeping errors searchable. I'm not sure the best approach for that. I do not have the resources to search all of \"The Internet\" and all \"Knowledgebases\" / \"Wikis\" to find things that people have referenced. I'd personally rather leave that bikeshed to the people who are going to maintain the system -- I'm happy to try to split out the commits likely to require such opinions.\n\nIt'd be helpful if you gave me some definite sense of what split you want (preferably with a specific ordering), I'm pretty close to being done w/ the fixes (I ended up doing two passes, and then I'll have to do at least one rebase to current).\n\nNote that one problem I have is that if a word is both misspelled in code and in a comment referencing that code, it doesn't really work to fix the comment first -- it has to actually wait until the code is fixed. For smaller repos and smaller series, this is more tractable, but your repo is surprisingly heavy in errors (I've submitted fixes to chakracore which isn't tiny either...).\n\nHere's a list that I could work from (it's similar to what I've done in the past):\n- comments \n- debug text\n- variables\n- internal functions\n- public text\n- resource keys\n- public APIs (typically, I'd create a commit for this and never submit it -- having the commit makes my tools happy)\n\nOh, one warning: I've excluded your subrepos from consideration. If your APIs are incestuous with them, then I expect that your tooling will complain, and someone else will have to figure out how to cross that bridge (I'd just drop the items from a PR).\n",
