It’s dangerous, and shouldn’t be used in production, but all scripting languages have an eval() equivalent.\r\n\r\nAlso of interest: his comment with specific invocation scenarios, https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4897#issuecomment-548141117, where he concludes:\r\n\r\n> I think the uses are quite obscure and Invoke-Expression needs no encouragement. We should just warn against it..\r\n\r\n",

    "body": ">  whether we should add the \"deprecated\" attribute to the code to enhance the warning about use of the cmdlet. This is separate from the question of how should this be documented.\r\n\r\nThanks for that clarification, @sdwheeler; the distinction wasn't obvious to me, and it seems that these aspects have already been conflated here, which is just as well, because I think discussing them in tandem makes sense.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for the _attribute_: I agree with @SeeminglyScience  that a PSSA rule is the right place to warn programmatically, if desired; certainly not at runtime, as that amounts to a quasi-breaking change.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for _documentation_ and use cases:\r\n\r\nIn the `Invoke-Expression` help topic, I think a general warning is sufficient, as @rjmholt proposes, along the following lines (adapted from the original https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2679 issue):\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> As a matter of habit, avoid use of `Invoke-Expression`, because there are usually more secure and robust alternatives.\r\n\r\n> If you do find that `Invoke-Expression` is your only choice, _carefully consider the security implications_: if a string from an (untrusted) outside source (e.g., user input) is passed directly to `Invoke-Expression`, _arbitrary commands may be executed_.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think that is sufficient for this particular help topic, but _separately_, perhaps in a new `about_Invoke-Expression` conceptual help topic, we could focus on when _not_ to use `Invoke-Expression`.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we could take widespread current and historical (mis)uses of `Invoke-Expression` and show _superior, safer alternatives_.\r\n\r\nIf we do end up agreeing on legitimate _public_ uses worth advertising (other than during PowerShell tests, as described by @rjmholt in https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4897#issuecomment-548141117), we can add them there as well.\r\n\r\nEven in the perhaps most seductive use case - direct execution of script text downloaded from the web (e.g,  `iwr https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1 | iex`) - `Invoke-Expression` is ultimately ill-advised, and enhancing `Invoke-Command` to operate on `Invoke-WebRequest` output should be favored - see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5909#issuecomment-461192202\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> While I agree that adding an `ObsoleteAttribute` would be annoying and probably not what we want here, I strongly disagree that it would be a breaking change.\r\n> \r\n> If adding `ObsoleteAttribute` to anything is a breaking change, then that attribute is pointless. \r\n\r\nIt definitely *can* break things (I know there is a difference between something breaking the change contract and a change technically breaking a thing, but bear with me):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-Something {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    end {\r\n        if ($theWorldIsEnding) {\r\n            $PSCmdlet.WriteWarning('some bad stuff is happening')\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is part of why I don't really like the warning system at all.  Most of the things I would want to warn about are better off as a non-terminating error anyway.\r\n\r\nIf something is writing a warning, I'm either silencing it, or throwing on it.  If I'm throwing on it with `-WarningAction Stop`, then adding `ObsoleteAttribute` will cause my script to always throw.\r\n\r\nI know that if it's considered a breaking change than that makes the attribute useless, but that's how it feels currently. Personally I think `ObsoleteAttribute` should be moved to a design time warning only, *maybe* with `error: true` being the exception.  That's how C# works as well, anything already built keeps on chugging but you're gonna know about it if you try to use it in something new.\r\n\r\n> The whole idea of attributes is that they behave as additive metadata.\r\n\r\nThat's true up until the point where something reads that metadata and changes behavior based on it. Adding `Mandatory` to a `ParameterAttribute` for example is for sure a breaking change.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** ~~Sorry this is pretty off topic.  Probably should have saved it for the new issue @rjmholt referred to.~~ I've marked this as off-topic and copied the issue into the new thread.",

    "body": "> Invoke-Expression is used extensively in our build module. #9459 is stale PR to remove.\r\n\r\nHmmmm. It looks like all those invocations could be replaced with a `&` and passing the arguments as literals. But the `[scriptblock]::Create()` method does exactly the same thing as `Invoke-Expression`. Perhaps we should write that into the rule?\r\n\r\n@JrrRomeroJose In your case @mklement0 is spot on. One point that comes up there sometimes is that `Invoke-Expression` on a string makes it easier to record exactly what the command executed was. However, that's exactly what [transcription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.host/start-transcript?view=powershell-7) is intended to do.",

When using >\r\n`Invoke-Expression` to run a command that the user enters, verify that the command is safe to run > before\r\nrunning it. In general, it is best to design your script with predefined input options, > rather than allowing\r\nfreeform input.\r\n```\r\n\r\n * As for further guidance: There's currently only a _Wiki_ article in the docs repo that is an unpolished collection of background information, scenarios to avoid, and also legitimate uses: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/wiki/The-case-for-and-against-Invoke-Expression\r\n     * Presumably because of its unpolished state, it isn't linked to from the `Invoke-Expression` help topic, which makes it hard to discover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/44411511/850abe80-7ca6-11e9-886f-a1b13b275ae0\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs\">MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs</a></strong></div><div>The official PowerShell documentation sources.

    "body": "You asked for reasons why we use it:\r\n\r\n## 1. Testability.\r\n\r\nShow me a way to **mock** the & call operator in Pester tests, and I could remove the vast majority of `Invoke-Expression` from my production code.\r\n\r\n## 2. Testing.\r\n\r\nIn our tests (and, incidentally, in the tests for Microsoft's DSC), there are frequent uses of Invoke-Expression to dynamically generate larger suites of tests without copy/pasting ... \r\n\r\n## 3. Importing metadata that aren't module manifests\r\n\r\nPeople who are not using my `Configuration` module or something like it, frequently use `Invoke-Expression (Get-Content...)` instead of Import-LocalizedData because:\r\n1. Import-LocalizedData is overly complicated to use for miscellaneous files because it has no -Path parameter\r\n2. Import-LocalizedData was too restrictive on the commands **and variables** it considered \"safe\" in metadata files (not even allowing all the same ones as module manifests). \r\n3. `Parser.ParseInput` or `Parser.ParseFile` combined with `ScriptBlock.CheckRestrictedLanguage` are complicated to use (especially since they've changed across PS versions)\r\n\r\n**BIG NOTE:** All we really need is for `Import-LocalizedData` to have a `-Path` parameter set in addition to the parameter set it has now, and a `-AllowedVariable` parameter to match `-AllowedCommand` it already has. Maybe alias it as `Import-Metadata` too ;-)\r\n\r\n## 4. Invoking code someone else gives us.\r\n\r\nYeah, this obviously includes a lot of at-the-commandline-only unsafe things like:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nInvoke-Expression (Invoke-RestMethod 'https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1')\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it also includes _really valid_ things like loading tab-completers from third party utilities:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nconda \"shell.powershell\" \"hook\" | Out-String | Invoke-Expression\r\n```\r\n```PowerShell\r\nchezmoi completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## My Conclusion\r\n\r\nObviously a lot of people will be very upset (as we always are when you break things) if you make our existing production code start producing warnings just because you've decided something you wrote a decade ago was a bad idea.\r\n\r\nScriptAnalyzer rules are a more polite way to coerce people to do things differently\r\n\r\nThis item has been open for way too long. There needs to be an automatic time-out on issues opened for the purpose of discussion.",

But yes, it's less convenient, for sure.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it will be really needed for #2 with Pester's new -ForEach functionality to generate tests a bit more dynamically, but yeah there are definitely some cases where things are much neater with code gen than other methods.\r\n\r\nFor #3 I think we may have other issues around that, but I agree it would be _very_ nice to make it easier to import files like that natively without invoke-expression.\r\n\r\nAnd heck, half the time I won't even really bother with Invoke-Expression for downloaded scripts like that, I'll just construct a scriptblock and use `&` to invoke it.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBut yeah, I don't think deprecating it is really the right move.
