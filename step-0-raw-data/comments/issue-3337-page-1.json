Here is a [recent example of the issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/101). \r\n\r\n- The script is not trying to confirm explicitly since this is unexpected behavior. \r\n- We need **better error messages** to see what caused the prompt and how we should avoid it (pass -Confirm:$false/-Force in some cases or another workarounds as suggested in the example above)\r\n- Error message should contain: the cmdlet causing the prompt, location(script file, line), error message, suggested way to bypass it (especially when it's not obvious) . For example:\r\n\r\n> An exception occurred when running script \"test.ps1\"  on line 34. The cmdlet \"Register-PSRepository\" prompted \"< message >\". Prompts are not supported in non-interactive mode. You can avoid the prompt by < suggested fix >.\r\n\r\nThanks",
