    "body": "For the record: the problem here is **EXTREMELY ANNOYING** and basically left my dream of using color codes in formatting files on hold. It also affects Format-Wide as well.\r\n\r\nWe can only add escape sequences to text if we're sure the text will not need to be truncated by the formatter. \r\n\r\nHere's a simple repro example:\r\n\r\nGiven a function that outputs objects ... \r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfunction Get-DemoObjects {\r\n    [PSCustomObject]@{PSTypeName = \"User\"; Name = \"Bob Saggat\"; Tenure = 2; Role = \"Developer\" }\r\n    [PSCustomObject]@{PSTypeName = \"User\"; Name = \"John Seymour\"; Tenure = 6; Role = \"Sw Engineer\" }\r\n    [PSCustomObject]@{PSTypeName = \"User\"; Name = \"Billy Bob Thorton\"; Tenure = 13; Role = \"Senior DevOps Engineer\" }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you format those objects such that they get truncated (imagine we did this in a format file):\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nGet-DemoObjects | Format-Table @{Width = 10; Name = \"Name\"; E = { $_.Name }}, \r\n                               @{Width = 15; Name = \"Role\";  E = { $_.Role }},\r\n                               @{Width = 3; Name = \"YIR\";  E = { $_.Tenure }}\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192942/164150152-e107a356-ac47-4cab-b343-e133851fe719.png)\r\n\r\nEverything is fine, until you add color, and suddenly things get over-truncated, and start sliding around.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nGet-DemoObjects |\r\n    Format-Table @{Width = 10; Name = \"Name\"; E = { (@(\"`e[32m\", \"`e[34m\", \"`e[33m\", \"`e[31m\", \"`e[33m\", \"`e[34m\", \"`e[32m\")[[array]::BinarySearch(@(3, 5, 8), $_.Tenure)]) + $_.Name + \"`e[39m\"}},\r\n                 @{Width = 15; Name = \"Role\";  E = { $_.Role }}, \r\n                 @{Width = 3; Name = \"YIR\";  E = { $_.Tenure }}\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192942/164151054-26bd5c4d-68af-4db1-b849-49f018d42945.png)\r\n\r\nBut it's even worse if you have more escape characters. If you get really unlucky, it can eat the whole text, completely. Other times, you get columns moving around so much they end up under the wrong heading and you can't make heads or tails of it. For my use case last week, imagine we had applied the same color formatting rule to three or four columns. Everything just looked ... random.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nGet-DemoObjects |\r\n    Format-Table @{Width = 10; Name = \"Name\"; E = { (@(\"`e[32m\", \"`e[34m\", \"`e[33m\", \"`e[31m\", \"`e[33m\", \"`e[34m\", \"`e[32m\")[[array]::BinarySearch(@(3, 5, 8), $_.Tenure)]) + $_.Name + \"`e[39m\"}},\r\n                 @{Width = 15; Name = \"Role\";  E = {\r\n                                -join $(switch -regex ($_.Role){\r\n                                        \"Senior\" { \"`e[42m\" }\r\n                                        \"Engineer\" { \"`e[1;33m\" }\r\n                                    }) + $_.Role  + \"`e[0m\"}}, \r\n                 @{Width = 3; Name = \"YIR\";  E = { $_.Tenure }}\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192942/164151993-7710b993-45d0-4d2a-80c8-eca613fae99f.png)\r\n\r\nNote that Format-Wide does the same thing, but it gets really weird sometimes. These columns overlap! What's even happening here?\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n(Get-DemoObjects) + (Get-DemoObjects) + \r\n(Get-DemoObjects) + (Get-DemoObjects) + \r\n(Get-DemoObjects) + (Get-DemoObjects) | \r\n    Format-Wide @{E = { (@(\"`e[32m\", \"`e[34m\", \"`e[33m\", \"`e[31m\", \"`e[33m\", \"`e[34m\", \"`e[32m\")[[array]::BinarySearch(@(3, 5, 8), $_.Tenure)]) + $_.Name + \"`e[39m\"}} -co 2| Out-String -Width 47\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192942/164153442-00511796-5fef-4131-b654-a029616ae93a.png)\r\n\r\nTechnically, Format-List is not affected by this, but colors don't work there either, because when it wraps, the second line gets no formatting, which is _really **gross**_: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192942/164153654-827ca3b5-fdcf-4439-9673-0b66be0a8d26.png)\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\n\r\nFor table formats, if you force the width of your columns, then you can write truncation in the format file. As long as the format doesn't output text that's too wide, the formatter won't need to truncate it (the miscalculation **only** affects the truncation, not the length measurement).\r\n\r\n",

That would be helpful.\r\n\r\n@daxian-dbw it's basically the same as above, just with `| Format-List` instead:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nGet-DemoObjects |\r\n    Format-List @{Name = \"Name\"; E = { (@(\"`e[32m\", \"`e[34m\", \"`e[33m\", \"`e[31m\", \"`e[33m\", \"`e[34m\", \"`e[32m\")[[array]::BinarySearch(@(3, 5, 8), $_.Tenure)]) + $_.Name + \"`e[39m\"}}\r\n```\r\nBecause I didn't want to make up new data, I just made the window very narrow (on Windows 10 you may have to increased the font size) to force the wrapping even though my text was really short 😉\r\n\r\n\r\nOff topic, and just for the record:\r\n@ninmonkey we talked about this on Discord, but just in case: The \"?\" in my prompt is due to a totally different bug in PSReadLine. It changes the color of the last character of your prompt as you type whenever the command isn't valid _syntax_, and **if** the last character is an extended character, and **if** your console encoding isn't set to UTF8, it screws up the character because it uses `Console.Write` (in my case, with OEM 437 encoding, that PowerLine arrow-block character isn't encodable).",
