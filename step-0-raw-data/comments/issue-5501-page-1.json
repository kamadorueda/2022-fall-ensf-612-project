It really is ridiculous that i have to toggle psreadline on and off to paste in long lines of code.  I like command completion so yes I have to turn it back on when I want to do things quickly.  \r\n\r\nAnother I would say pretty sparsely documented quirk is having to turn off tty to see the output of some programs, important programs that are part of the git tool chain like sshagent, there have been others that I cannot recall atm. \r\n\r\nIt really gives the user the impression that docker for windows is somehow not as good or cared for as docker on linux, which i'm sure isn't the truth. \r\n\r\nOtherwise things are going well, but please is there anyway this can be fixed?",
