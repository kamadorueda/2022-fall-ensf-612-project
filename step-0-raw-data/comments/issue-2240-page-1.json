    "body": "> @jonathanmedd For clarity, by \"we\" I mean Microsoft and the Community. SOAP is not something I personally have any need for, so this is very very low on my priority stack and not on any of my roadmaps. So, I'm really wanting someone who actually needs the commands to lead the charge on this one. You game?\r\n\r\nI'm sorry but this statement is not very accurate. SOAP is also not my favourite but there are lots of companies with established products still using SOAP. The entire travelling industry is SOAP based. For example, [amadeus.com[(https://amadeus.com) API which is used by at airlines, trains, fairies etc is all SOAP based. There are almost 1/4 comments complaining about the lack of SOAP support in [Introducing .NET 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-net-5/). \r\n\r\nOverall, with the current situation, we can't do any serious SOAP automation on PowerShell 6. With the roadmap for PowerShell 7 that was recently announced, it seems that this will be possible again but in reality, this will be only for Windows. However .NET Core 3 is presented, it is, in essence, a very fancy abstraction of the operating system and doesn't solve the shortcomings in the APIs of .NET Core and therefore PowerShell 7.\r\n\r\nUnless I'm mistaken, Azure Functions over PowerShell supports only PowerShell 6. \r\n\r\nI believe that the .net and PowerShell teams need to have a discussion about this topic. I really understand what the technology drivers are and I'm all against SOAP but the reality is that it exists on big proportions with no alternatives and that only 10years ago Microsoft was pushing very hard for WCF and developers followed. It is not well communicated why the `System.ServiceModel` assembly is not ported natively into the core API. Just dismissing SOAP doesn't sound like a good explanation to me, especially given our reality.",
