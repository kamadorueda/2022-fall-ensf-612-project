    "body": "@dddugan It's certainly a difference of opinion on how it should work. On the one hand, we need to maintain parity with the objects as they are returned from the API and on the other is convenience. I cannot condone making the default behavior break parity with APIs. As someone who works heavily with APIs, I cannot stand it when something makes assumptions about how the objects should be provided to me, especially when that assumption breaks with what the API has documented. The API says it will return an array of objects per page, I would expect and array of arrays from `FollowReLlink`. My vehicle for obtaining these objects from the API may change, and I don't want to adjust my logic to fit with what ever API breaking format that vehicle has decided to impose on me.\r\n\r\nWe could _maybe_ add a switch to unwrap arrays, but, I'm not real excited about doing so. I think it is best to just return the objects as they are and let the user decide how they want to process them. \r\n\r\n> FollowRelLink was added as a convenience so the caller doesn't need to think about paging and multiple calls.\r\n\r\nAnd they don't. In 5.1 for this operation to work you needed \r\n\r\n1. fall back to `Invoke-WebRequest`, \r\n1. Check for errors,\r\n1. Inspect Content-type header,\r\n1. convert the `Content` to an object, \r\n1. handle serialization errors,\r\n1. inspect the headers for `Link`, \r\n1. regex parse the single `Link` header, \r\n1. and finally repeat the process with the `next` link URI. \r\n\r\nIn 6.0.0 `irm -FollowRelLink` manages all of that for you.
