    "body": "it does not address the specifics of #2368 as it does not provide an addition .evtx file (which is required). However, it does add additional tests which validate much of the behavior of the cmdlet.\nI'm investigating how to create an evtx file on the fly, but didn't want this PR to be held up for that. Further, this PR provides examples of queries for WinEvent in a fairly general way, e.g., it doesn't require any specific .evtx file to be present, and that the only assumption being made is that there are events on the system _somewhere_ (which is probably a fair assumption on any windows system).\n",
