It's a small change, but there are things that are open to debate, such as:\r\n\r\n- in which class to put the function, we only have one for now, but we leave space for adding more if required in the future.\r\n- naming of the class and, I named it 'NativeHost' but it could very well be named 'UnmanagedHost' if this is preferred\r\n- the LoadAssemblyData() function and how it uses the Default ALC, maybe there is a nice way to support non-default ALCs\r\n\r\nI'm not very familiar with ALCs, but loading my bindings to the PowerShell class inside the default ALC works just fine for me. If someone can foresee a potential limitation with ALCs and knows more about them than I do, it would be work pointing it out now.",

I would hate to have to wait for 7.3 just for 5 lines of code, but I would be fine with requiring 7.2 as a baseline just for this.\r\n\r\nPlease tell me exactly what to fix, I'll do it once, and then we can move on.

If MSFT PowerShell team does not want to spend even 1 cent, then we continue this PR given that the security team did not find any problems in this.\r\n    Given the specifics of this API the status of this API should be \"not public, not supported, only for external partner, can be removed in any time\".\r\n2. Second option is to implement the wrap dll as shared solution.\r\n    Considering that the project is _open source_, it would be more correct design to implement this wrap dll in PowerShell / NativeSDK repository so that other native host projects can benefit from this.\r\nSince PowerShell managed SDK is very stable the Native SDK will be stable too and shouldn't take a lot of effort to maintain.\r\nThat we need to do:\r\n    - wrap most of useful PowerShell public API in the dll and cover most of native host scenarios.\r\n    - publish as nuget signed by Microsoft\r\n    - distribute with PowerShell (reference the nuget in Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK.csproj)\r\n        -  as standalone file (a native host must ensure that this dll is loaded)\r\n        -  or with an API hook to load always or on demand (preffered I believe) from a native host\r\n\r\n/cc @SteveL-MSFT @JamesWTruher @daxian-dbw who could weight and select a direction we will follow.\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/295841?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/awakecoding/pwsh-native-host\">awakecoding/pwsh-native-host</a></strong></div><div>pwsh native host experiment.

    "body": "@iSazonov thank you for the detailed follow up. I noticed that you pointed to my larger set of bindings, and I just want to clarify that my PR is to add a single function that makes it possible to load any set of bindings not distributed with PowerShell. In other words, a single native function export to load your own bindings, and not the whole set of bindings, making it a \"bring your own bindings\" type of solution, but no additional file or installation required to load the bindings.\r\n\r\nYour first suggestion is still what I'd like: just include this single function somewhere into PowerShell and we can take it from there without further modifications to PowerShell. My very first use case for this is a Rust crate that will enable loading and using PowerShell entirely at runtime *without redistributing PowerShell, and without link time dependencies*. This is what I could validate with my proof-of-concept in C, and since then I've been working very hard to find a solution to the last problem of requiring at last one additional file on disk distributed separately.\r\n\r\nThe second suggestion of making a wrapper DLL as a shared solution would unfortunately greatly increase the scope of the project and take it in a completely new direction. Because it's very hard to know *how* foreign language XYZ would deal with the bindings, I wouldn't even consider trying to do it that way. This being said, nothing prevents implementing the first suggestion (single native function export + bring your own bindings) and then working on a useful set of bindings that most people would be fine with. However, that would be a totally different story and out-of-scope for the current work.\r\n\r\nSince the security team did not find any objections to the current PR, maybe it's already good enough for a possible merge, unless someone wants to request modifications? At this point any change request would likely be non-functional in nature (name and location in the code), but there seems to be no objection on the actual code change made here.\r\n\r\nSo, who can give their seal of approval on this one? @SteveL-MSFT ? :)",

This looks like the ideal place to put it, as the helper function is really AssemblyLoadContext-related, and will always remain.\r\n\r\nThe only future extensions I could foresee for this class are more AssemblyLoadContext-related helper functions. I've heard there was talk of eventually supporting multiple ALCs for dependencies and make it easier to unload and reload modules, but it's nothing available at this point. However, I could easily see a few functions added in that new class when advanced ALC support is added to PowerShell to expose the equivalent to a native host.\r\n\r\n@rjmholt with the code moved to SMA under a new name as suggested by @iSazonov is there anything else you would see that might require changes?",

I wouldn't want to block the initial inclusion of this function that unlocks a whole new world for easier native host implementations. Adding the ability to test automatically unmanaged code for PowerShell may prove difficult if it hasn't been done before.\r\n\r\nHere's the deal: my current proof-of-concept C code is not in a clean state, but I would definitely improve it as I work on the new Rust implementation side-by-side. I need to deal with a few portability issues (UTF-16 in Windows, cross-platform path handling, etc). I've got C utils I can import to make a minimalistic C library with a stable external API that uses UTF-8. While I don't intend to push the C implementation much beyond the basics, it should be sufficient for testing.\r\n\r\nOnce I have this first cleaned up C implementation I will get to work on porting it to Rust, and plan on working mostly with the Rust implementation from there. I suggest that the C implementation becomes the reference for anybody interested in implementing it in other languages. Maybe there would be sufficient interest in the C implementation, in this case I don't mind accepting improvements.\r\n\r\nCan we agree to include the new function before we get the ability to test it automatically? I will follow-up with the team to see how we could add testing capabilities for unmanaged hosts in the future in due time, but waiting for this now would simply prevent the project from taking off the ground.",

It's important because the new function greatly reduces friction for the upcoming work.\n\nAdding support for testing native hosts in the PowerShell CI environment will likely bring up a lot of questions and it will definitely be subject to a *lot* of discussion. If the discussion leading to a 2-line function is this big, I can't help but wonder how adding the compilation and execution of a C program as part of the tests will look like. It's a discussion worth having but it won't be a piece of cake.\n\nI offer to follow up on the automated testing work after the current pull request is merged and gather everybody else interested in testing similar functionality to continue the discussion in a new issue.\n\nIs there anything else that might block the current pull request at this point? It does look like we've been to the end of it, as the next steps would be future work in separate issues.\n",

(Some folks have argued that `powershell.exe` may not be the right place to ship these hooks, but again, *high-level* value.)\r\n\r\nI understand that this sort of back-and-forth is not ideal, but the stability of PowerShell and the long-term supported nature of its APIs is not something we take lightly. Regardless of the # of LOCs, this is an API that we will have to support for many, many years to come and as such, these discussions *and* testing are required in order to make progress. Furthermore, even if it's expensive, this implies that testing cannot be an afterthought, *particularly* where we have low existing coverage. \r\n\r\nThe current thinking from the @PowerShell/powershell-committee is that, given that all (or nearly enough of all) native hosts are compatible with C, something robustly designed and similar to the APIs that exist in your proof-of-concept C bindings are actually what we'd want to ship as opposed to this low-level hook that leaves implementation of said C bindings up to individual developers. Particularly, given that this low-level hook essentially allows you to do whatever you want, there are number of unsafe things that can happen if those C bindings (or Rust or Python or whatever) are not implemented correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we don't have quorum without @SteveL-MSFT today, and we'd like to get his opinion before we feel comfortable closing this PR, but it's something we probably will need to rework with a longer term conversation. \r\n\r\nAs a side note: is there a reason why you can't currently use your fork as the implementation that unblocks your current scenario? \r\n",

However, since the feature is intended for PowerShell specifically, doing it inside PowerShell instead of the .NET runtime is acceptable, especially from a high-level point of view.\r\n\r\n> I understand that this sort of back-and-forth is not ideal, but the stability of PowerShell and the long-term supported nature of its APIs is not something we take lightly. Regardless of the # of LOCs, this is an API that we will have to support for many, many years to come and as such, these discussions _and_ testing are required in order to make progress. Furthermore, even if it's expensive, this implies that testing cannot be an afterthought, _particularly_ where we have low existing coverage.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between *enabling* developers to extend PowerShell, and offering complex APIs that developers rely on and therefore need to be actively maintained. These changes are intentionally made very small to facilitate reviewing but also to reduce the maintenance burden to a minimum. If you think testing cannot be an afterthought, then we should discuss *how* we can test native applications within the PowerShell CI environment. However, judging from past discussion on smaller changes, I can only imagine how long it would take to wait for native application testing capabilities.\r\n\r\n> The current thinking from the @PowerShell/powershell-committee is that, given that all (or nearly enough of all) native hosts are compatible with C, something robustly designed and similar to the APIs that exist in your proof-of-concept C bindings are actually what we'd want to ship as opposed to this low-level hook that leaves implementation of said C bindings up to individual developers. Particularly, given that this low-level hook essentially allows you to do whatever you want, there are number of unsafe things that can happen if those C bindings (or Rust or Python or whatever) are not implemented correctly.\r\n\r\nI understand why you and the PowerShell committee think it is a good idea, but I have to strongly disagree on this point: even if we do decide to work on exposing a rich C API, we should still make it possible for third-parties to develop the entire set of bindings separately. In fact, that is *precisely* what the current changes are intended for: it is not possible to know how language XYZ would rather deal with the bindings, so don't even try to guess what it should be.\r\n\r\nFor instance, if we expose a rich set of C APIs, they will essentially be unsafe APIs from the Rust point of view, while there are many ways safer Rust to C# bindings could be implemented. However, this requires full control over the bindings from the foreign language, which is why I intend to generate, build and \"link\" the C# bindings inside the Rust library that will use them.\r\n\r\nI also certainly do not wish to enter the debate on how to handle the marshalling of certain types like strings (UTF-8 null terminated C strings vs UTF-16 on Windows for C, etc). Native Rust string types are not even null-terminated and are passed with an implicit length (char slices). If I can control both sides, I can make something much better for Rust. If we make C bindings, I'm stuck making unsafe code and deal with a C API to invoke what is in fact managed C#.\r\n\r\nI am not against making a rich set of APIs, but I consider it to be complementary, not mutually exclusive with enabling developers to write their own set of bindings correctly adapted to the foreign language of their choice. Even if we do make an official C SDK, I wouldn't be surprised if many would rather prefer to build their own with extended functionality, just because it doesn't need to be officially approved and merged upstream. In other words, third-party SDKs benefit from much higher flexibility, and they are also not an additional burden for the PowerShell team.\r\n\r\nYou mention how every API added to PowerShell needs to be supported for a long time. I understand that, which is why I don't want to add more APIs than necessary, and make it possible for others to extend on top of PowerShell without necessarily becoming officially-supported PowerShell extensions that you have to live with for the next 10 years or so.\r\n\r\n> Unfortunately, we don't have quorum without @SteveL-MSFT today, and we'd like to get his opinion before we feel comfortable closing this PR, but it's something we probably will need to rework with a longer term conversation.\r\n> \r\n> As a side note: is there a reason why you can't currently use your fork as the implementation that unblocks your current scenario?\r\n\r\nDespite what I may have suggested in the past, I never actually forked PowerShell, because it would involve building it for all platforms and distributing my modified version, which would be... a gigantic pain. I don't actually need to fork PowerShell for this specific change, because I could *install* a single DLL to expose the same function, and \"link\" 99% of my bindings inside my Rust program. However, I would be unable to distribute a simple Rust library that you can import to start using PowerShell, because everybody would have to install the same DLL with a 2-line function in it.\r\n\r\nIt may not seem like a big deal, but it is, as it causes significant friction and doesn't enable easy \"PowerShell as a library\" functionality. Languages like Rust or Go produce self-contained executables with everything statically linked, requiring just one additional file to be separately distributed will be major pain point for anybody interesting in using it.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, here are the important points to consider:\r\n\r\n- If we should delay the current PR for the lack of testability, we should discuss that in priority. I would rather not delay it, but if that's what it takes, let's make it happen sooner than later.\r\n- While I am open to making an official, richer set of APIs in a PowerShell C SDK, it should *not* be mutually exclusive with the current changes enabling third-party SDKs not officially supported by the PowerShell team.\r\n",

Can `LoadAssemblyFromMemory` return a bool to indicate success/failure? @daxian-dbw do you have a suggestion on this?\r\n\r\nA bool is not enough, because then we have no way to tell the difference between failure to load because of bad parameters or data, and failure to load because the experimental feature was disabled. you need an int with a list of error codes for this.\r\n\r\nAs for pwsh.exe -settings <mycustomsettings.json> it does make it less bad, but now I need to generate and write a file to the disk. The only difference is it likely won't be flagged as malicious as opposed to writing a temporary DLL to the disk.",

We don't even need to throw an exception, just the presence or absence of the function is sufficient, so you can remove it in the future if the committee decides to remove it.

    "body": "@awakecoding Given that we are going to just advertise the API as experimental without really blocking it when the experimental feature is disabled, do you still think it's not sufficient to just return 0/1 to indicate the loading success/failure?\r\n\r\nAsking this API to pass along the reason for a loading failure is nice to have, but seems an overkill to me. When this API fails, it could fail in many potential ways, e.g. possible internal failures in `UnmanagedMemoryStream` when wrapping the native memory; possible failure when reading from the `UnmanagedMemoryStream`; possible failures like \"BadImage\" thrown from `LoadFromStream`, and etc. If you want the failure reason to be passed along accurately, then you will need to understand all possible exceptions that could be thrown in such a scenario, which I don't think is straightforward or obvious to find out, and then map them to a list of error codes.\r\n\r\nThis API is more like a hack to light up something that is currently missing in .NET, rather than a permanent thing that will be maintained in PowerShell -- we will deprecate it when this functionality appears in .NET. So I would prefer to just make it simple.",
