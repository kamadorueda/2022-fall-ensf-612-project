This can leave the system it is designed to manage in a non consistent state - half of the cmdlets were executed, the half were not. This is potentially a dangerous situation.

I wrote some scripts with Debian/Ubuntu compatibility in mind (httpd vs apache, for example), but they never been tested on it on any meaningfull extent.\r\n\r\nWhile #requires prohibits running on not supported environment, the best part in it is what it could be analyzed even *without* running the script.\r\nSo, #tested could be used as indication if current environment is tested one for execution (maybe we will have some Test-ScriptCompatibility cmdlet someday?), without even running script.\r\nAlso PS engine could emit warning/verbose/debug message, if current environment is not supported, warning user about possible incompatibilites.\r\n\r\nI would like to hear your opinion on this idea (especially @dronkoff), so if it is as good as I imagine - I will create separate thread for a more broad discussion.\r\n",
