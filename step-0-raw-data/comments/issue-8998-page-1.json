    "body": "Sorry, that's probably just me debugging it. Output Normal vs Output XML. I was playing with Windows Firewall at that stage trying to see if I had outbound traffic restrictions on a per application basis that were affecting it somehow.\r\n\r\nI've asked the nmap crew what it's doing as well, and I'm awaiting an answer for that one. I think it's trying to do raw sockets and controlling ethernet / IP frames directly, but if it works from Powershell why not from Powershell remoting?",
