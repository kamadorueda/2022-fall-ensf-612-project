So end of file won't close things, but you can make any key combo a  short cut for exit. (Much childish fun can be had with _that_)\r\n\r\nShould ctrl D ==> exit be a  default if PS-Readline sees it's on linux ? I can see the case for that on the grounds it's what a linux users expects of a a shell, but I wouldn't change what Windows users are used to. \r\n ",
