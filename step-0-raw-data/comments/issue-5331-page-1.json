If you have a method like Int32.TryParse() that returns a bool to indicate status you'd typically just return $false and do nothing else.\r\n\r\nThe problem here, I think, is that classes don't really operate in the PowerShell pipeline like functions do. This means that they're restricted to the same model of output as other .NET classes, which don't have the many streams that PowerShell does.\r\n\r\nPerhaps @daxian-dbw can answer why this is not being maintained for [void] methods.
