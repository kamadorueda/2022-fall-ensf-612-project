[Pash](https://github.com/Pash-Project/Pash) made use of the document some, but I believe they found it rather incomplete.\n\nNow that the official implementation is open source, I'm guessing the biggest value of the language specification is as an aid to learning the language.  Do people agree with this?\n\nI also wonder if the community would be willing to help update it.\n",

Thanks for that reference, but we have quite a few new things in the past _nine years_ ðŸ˜…\r\n\r\nAre you asking for something similar to [ECMA-335](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-335/) for CLI? PowerShell isn't a set of behavioral rules that one can implement.  I guess it technically could be, but such a document would be exponentially larger than EMCA-335.",
