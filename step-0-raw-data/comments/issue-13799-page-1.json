Anyway, as far as I understand, tab completion completes just method name and there are already tests for that.\r\n\r\nTab expansion results include a tooltip, which is only shown in editors and some PSReadLine key handlers (but not the <kbd>Tab</kbd> one).  You can see it here:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(TabExpansion2 -inputScript ($s = '$Host.PushRunspace') -cursorColumn $s.Length).CompletionMatches\r\n```\r\n\r\nreturns\r\n\r\n```raw\r\nCompletionText ListItemText ResultType ToolTip\r\n-------------- ------------ ---------- -------\r\nPushRunspace(  PushRunspace     Method void PushRunspace(runspace runspace)…\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I also want to suggest to mark parameters passed by reference with `[in]` and `[out]` keywords in addition to the `[ref]`.

Part of the problem there is that `[in]` and `[out]` aren't really a thing in PowerShell, so the way to pass it will still be `[ref]`.\r\n\r\n",
