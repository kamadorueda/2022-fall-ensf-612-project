    "body": "Because PowerShell Standard was created to be able to target both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core, which is now cross platform I can understand why the registry was not added as non-Windows systems do not have a registry. PowerShell Standard is not the solution to everything unfortunately and where the standard does not fit, you'll still have to multi-target.\r\nUnless we want to do something special for Windows like a Windows specific Standard, I fear this might be 'by design'",
