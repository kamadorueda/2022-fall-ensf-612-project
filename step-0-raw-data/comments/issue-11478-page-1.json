    "body": "What's in `$log`? If that's a logfile with a few hundred or a few thousand lines, keep in mind that in order to be parallelized in this manner, that data has to be _copied_ to each runspace before it can be used.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, I'd expect some extra memory usage for that. I daresay this would be the kind of task you should _not_ parallelize, since you have one data input source that you're now copying probably quite a few times.\r\n\r\nI would guess that you could make this a lot quicker by simply skipping the internal foreach loop on your single-threaded code:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$messageids = [System.Collections.Generic.List[string]]$messageids\r\n$uniqueEntries = foreach ($entry in $log) {\r\n    if ($entry.messageid -in $messageids) {\r\n        # remove the message ID we found from our list so we only get the first item of that ID\r\n        $messageids.Remove($entry.messageid) > $null\r\n        $entry\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    # If we find one of all our IDs, we can exit here\r\n    if ($messageids.Count -eq 0) {\r\n        break\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n$uniqueEntries | Export-Csv -Path mtl_midunique.csv -Encoding UTF8\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of unnecessary piping and re-iterating the same large collection both in single and multithreaded versions of your code. In either case, it's not going to be particularly efficient. For the multithreaded case, though, copying a large log file to multiple runspaces is always going to be rather tricky to do with any kind of efficiency.",

    "body": "As a script writer I would expect the memory usage to be more related to the number of parallel threads I'm running and not the total number of items I've piped through the `Foreach-Object -Parallel`. I'm not sure what the technology being used for the parallel implementation is but using a runspace pool to go through the same scriptblock I mentioned above introduced almost no memory overhead (analysis done with task manager). I'm not a developer and don't have any background on optimizing memory usage, but overall this just doesn't feel right. Garbage collection takes care of the memory usage if it's run after the scriptblock is complete but I can't figure out how to make garbage collection release the memory while the scriptblock is still being executed.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just a usage pattern thing? Maybe `Foreach-Object -Parallel` works better for a small number of long running tasks and not a large number of short running tasks?",

My main concern is side effects due to state leakage between loop iterations, but hopefully there won't be any or they will be insignificant.  \r\n\r\nThe PR is currently marked as WIP.  Can you clone my fork and build the branch (foreach-parallel-rsreuse), and test?",
