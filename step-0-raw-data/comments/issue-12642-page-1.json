    "body": "When testing this myself, without delving into the code:\r\n- Events are retrieved from the service in batches\r\n  - Events in each batch could be operated on in parallel, but that would likely not improve anything.\r\n  - You wouldn't like it if every time you asked for a single event, pwsh ate all of your CPU time pre-computing the next thousand or more events in the background, even if it could possibly improve this specific calling pattern.\r\n- There are multiple calls to EvtFormatMessage per event\r\n  - In my test, almost 8000 calls per batch of events, or **over 100 per event**\r\n  - The overhead for all those RPC calls is tremendous. Fully 50% of the total time is spent setting up RPC call data structures and marshalling data between the service and pwsh.\r\n- Of the remaining 50% of the time, 25% is spent in FormatMessageW (as expected), and 25% is spent doing misc. work in the service around the FormatMessageW call.\r\n\r\nEliminate the excessive calls to EvtFormatMessage, and get-winevent should be about as fast as can reasonably be expected. Unfortunately, these calls appear to be coming from .Net's System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader class, rather than the cmdlet itself.\r\n\r\n_To truly improve the performance of this cmdlet, it should be re-written to call the native Evt APIs directly rather than bumble through the .Net wrapper classes. Doing so would not only bypass many of the design flaws in the wrapper classes, but also would allow the event properties (and their corresponding RPC calls) to be retrieved on-demand. I'm sure such a rewrite would be a breaking change, however, since the cmdlet currently returns System.Diagnostics.Eventing.Reader.EventLogRecord objects._",
