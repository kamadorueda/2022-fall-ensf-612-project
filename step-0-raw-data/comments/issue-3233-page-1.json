    "body": "Formatting and output uses metadata and a set of heuristics to _automagically_ guess how to render an item. Format-Table in particular assumes that it's rendering a more or less homogeneous collection objects (i.e. a table). In the absence of metadata describing the specific set of properties to render, it applies heuristics to the first object picking a set of properties to display by default. You can override this set on the command line, giving a specific set of properties to render in a specific order. This addresses your example:\r\n`$a,$b | ft -au a,b`\r\nIf you have a heterogeneous set of objects where you know the aggregate set of properties you're interested in, then simply specify those properties on the command line. If you don't know (or don't want to figure out) the aggregate set of properties, then I suggest using Format-List which works much better with heterogeneous collections of object. (Also note that Format-Table, in the absence of metadata, will only display 10 columns.)\r\n\r\nUltimately, the formatter is heuristic - it makes a best guess at how to render an object. In some cases that works fine but most cases require additional metadata to render objects the way you want.",
