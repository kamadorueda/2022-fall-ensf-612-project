My inclination is that starting a new process is desirable (so perhaps more POSIX-like), but I'm open to a discussion, especially given PowerShell's slow startup cost.\r\n\r\nAs for `-File` - I mentioned that only in regards to semantics - we want shebang to behave as though `-File` was specified, in part so the exit code is set correctly.\r\n\r\nAnd as for `$0`, I was hinting at what I thought it would take to implement what I propose above - that we have a new code path that behaves as though you ran `powershell -File foo` when `argv[0] == 'foo'`.",
