    "body": "The cmdlet working group meets today and I may get some views there. \r\nI think there are two things \r\n1.  Use of square brackets in file names. Elsewhere they are normal characters. Windows and unix file systems have their own set of special characters which aren't allowed but square brackets are legal. For the `[` and `]` to be be meta characters and need escaping is a surprise. \r\n2. Inconsistent behaviour. What would be **expect** `New-Item -Force -Path 'My D*\\test.txt'` to do ? error or resolve My Documents ? What if 'My D*' resolves to more than one item - error or create both ? If it doesn't resolve that's an error.  `Test[123]` should do the same thing. Different commands seem to do different things, and `[123]` isn't treated as a wild card everywhere .\r\n",
