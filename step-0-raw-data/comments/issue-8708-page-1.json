    "body": "@BladeFireLight The default parameter `-Path` is not a mandatory parameter so there isn't an automatic  check for null or empty path strings. (Note: if you use `-LiteralPath`, you will see the error you're expecting.) In fact there is explicit code in `ProcessRecord` for the cmdlet that sets the path list to examine to be an array containing a single empty string if the path is null. Keep in mind that that PowerShell is a _shell_ and so tries to do something useful if it can which in this case is to return the current directory.  Finally the PowerShell behaviour is the same as `bash` or `cmd.exe` WRT empty strings - it displays the current directory (though for a different reason.)",

I had to restore and all of my stuff on my machine was lost. I learned this lesson the hard way but maybe others don't have to :). May be giving an error (when null) or keeping this parameter (mandatory) would be better from a risk standpoint :). ",
