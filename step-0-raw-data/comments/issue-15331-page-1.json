It depends on the behavior that `-File -` prints the prompt to detect the end of a command line execution.\r\n\r\nThere may be other uses that depend on the current behavior of `-command -` and `-file -`, so I think we should keep it unchanged and adding new syntax for reading the whole stdin content as file content. Maybe `-file --`?",
