    "body": "Basically, SSH doesn't support the concept of just sending username/password as it's not considered secure.  The default is to require keyboard-interactive auth which the server (sshd) sends a  prompt back to the client (ssh) and the user types their password.  SSH does have a concept of ASKPASS as a way to prompt for username/password for GUIs (where there isn't a console to receive the prompt).  We could piggy back on this and simply pass the username/password from a PSCredential as though the user typed it.  ",

    "body": "I think the primary scenario users have been asking for is to be able to use `-Credential` with `-Hostname` (aka SSH).  `ssh` doesn't support a way to pass in username/password, however, it can use the exe pointed to by `SSH_ASKPASS` to prompt for the password and that exe would send that password as cleartext to stdout which `ssh` would receive and use.\r\n\r\nThe `New-PSSession` cmdlet would need a new parameter set for SSH where it's mutually exclusive from `-UserName` called `-Credential`.  At this point, the cmdlet would have both the username and password (as securestring).  To pass that to `ssh`, I think the way to do it is when we [start the `ssh` process](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/9ea718f1719e54e81ae8c704f9b1bd2357ad90bc/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/common/RunspaceConnectionInfo.cs#L2099) we need to set the [EnvironmentVariables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo.environmentvariables?view=net-5.0) to include `SSH_ASKPASS` to point to `echo` (or equivalent command) where the argument is the password.  `DISPLAY` env var will probably also need to be explicitly set to empty for this process.",
