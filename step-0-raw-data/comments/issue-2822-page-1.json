As long as we have an issue tracking it, we can postpone the fix until we know more about how bad it will freeze the progress pane after this fix.\r\nAs for the flicking issue, I think it's fine.

I know that there is no hard requirement that sequential percentage-based progress records are going to increment but if we're doing the former, I might question the value of this. It seems only important to not miss out the \"Complete\" marker record, but others might be safely skipped. Thoughts? I haven't seen this discussed in any other threads.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: Oh, never mind -- I'm having a slow day today as I try to get back into work that involves thinking again.
