    "body": "I would definitely alert the AD team to the inconsistency.\r\n\r\nAs for the JSON representation: it seems that the properties named in the `.PropertyCollection` are also surfaced as top-level properties, in addition to the type-native ones, and the case variation is then considered a distinct property - I personally don't know enough about `ConvertTo-Json` to know why and where that happens.\r\n\r\nWhile certainly undesired here, note that the result _is_ well-formed JSON, where - unlike in PowerShell - identifiers are case-_sensitive_, so case variations of the same property name - however ill-advised - _are_ allowed.\r\n\r\nAs the error message suggests, the way to work around the issue is to use `-AsHashtable` with `ConvertFrom-Json`, which returns a `[hashtable]` instance with case-_sensitive_ key definitions and lookups (unlike regular PowerShell hashtables).\r\n\r\nNote that another thing that JSON allows is property names that are the _empty string_. There too `ConvertFrom-Json` cannot be used, and `-AsHashtable` is required.\r\n",

I agree that it's valid JSON, so I suppose my intent was to suggest that if the export is going to result in JSON that the import is going to complain about, a warning at the export side might also help.\r\n\r\nFor now I am avoiding the issue by selecting specific properties when exporting.  I will, however, seek to alert the AD team.\r\n",
