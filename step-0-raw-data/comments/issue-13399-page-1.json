If not and if we are going to keep both for a long period of time, then we probably will need to refactor the code to consolidate them.\r\n\r\n[Update] The refactoring ask doesn't block this PR, but should be a follow-up work item.\r\n\r\nAlso, a general question about tests. How much DSC tests do we have for both the existing code and new code in this PR? (may not be in this repo) We will need solid amount of tests for the \"DSC as a subsystem\" work in 7.2.",

And even if JSON is new, they should use Class anyway.\r\n\r\nI know a breaking change is a pain, but **if we have to have one**, lets make the best use of it.\r\n\r\n/cc @johlju @PlagueHO @dsccommunity @bagajjal ",
