    "body": "> whether they mean \"zero or more\" spaces or \"one or more\" spaces\r\n\r\nAt the risk of being pedantic, the specification doesn't _explicitly_ allow _any_ whitespace there. The `*()` indicates one or more instances of `;link-param` can follow `<URI-Reference>` - with no whitespace after the `>` or bfore the `;` .\r\n\r\nThat said, RFC5988 follows RFC2616 ABNF notation, which _implicitly_ allows for linear white space (LWS) between any two adjacent tokens or quoted-strings, and between adjacent words and separators.\r\n\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.2\r\n```\r\nLWS            = [CRLF] 1*( SP | HT )\r\nSP             = <US-ASCII SP, space (32)>\r\nHT             = <US-ASCII HT, horizontal-tab (9)>\r\n```\r\n\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-2.1\r\n```\r\nimplied *LWS\r\n      The grammar described by this specification is word-based. Except\r\n      where noted otherwise, linear white space (LWS) can be included\r\n      between any two adjacent words (token or quoted-string), and\r\n      between adjacent words and separators, without changing the\r\n      interpretation of a field. At least one delimiter (LWS and/or\r\n\r\n      separators) MUST exist between any two tokens (for the definition\r\n      of \"token\" below), since they would otherwise be interpreted as a\r\n      single token.\r\n```\r\nIn `link-value     = \"<\" URI-Reference \">\" *( \";\" link-param )`, `\";\"` is a quoted string and `link-param` is a token, so the space is implicitly allowed between them, but not required.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think we're on the same page; just wanted to clarify the interpretation of the RFC",
