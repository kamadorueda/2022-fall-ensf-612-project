    "body": "Another point of ponderance to me is, if these values are set to -1 and not valid colours, how does general text display in a PowerShell session work? It implies there is another place that that colours are being set from, but where? As a work around, I am manually going to set these values to 'gray' and 'black' in my module initialisation code and inform the user (via documntation) they can override these default values. However, I can foresee another problem; how can we detect wether the user is using a light or dark console? If using a dark console (which I am assuming) then foreground = 'gray' and background = 'black' are correct defaults, however, if they're using a light console, this will result in not beng able to see displayed text. To detect the light or dark console I would have just consulted $host.ui.rawui.ForegroundColor/BackgroundColor but they are incorrectly set, hence this issue. My PowerShell module code already declares a custom environment variable boolean flag that indicates light or dark console (as there is no equivalent in powershell core) which the user can set, so I'll tie my logic to this flag for the time being.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
