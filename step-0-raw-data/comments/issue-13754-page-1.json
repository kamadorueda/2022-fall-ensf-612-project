    "body": "That would involve changing and possibly breaking quite a few other cmdlets / use cases that work with the pspath/literalpath pipeline binding. For example, the Registry doesn't really have objects that have a FullName or similar property from memory that works quite the same way that filesystem objects do, they have a PSPath and then if you want anything else you're more or less left to construct it from pieces, which gets quite annoying.\r\n\r\nThis is as far as I ever got to fixing this, the proper \"fix\" is still not clear to me, there'a a fair bit of discussion in this old, unmerged PR: #9294\r\n\r\nThe other issue we've seen around this is #9293, which I guess this one is essentially a duplicate of. Might be more productive to continue discussion in that issue?",
