    "body": "@joeyaello, thanks for [showing awareness of the problem in the Nov 19 community call](https://youtu.be/IHMgWobHzrI?t=2446): \r\n\r\n> To be honest, this kind of did sway me on this issue a little bit, we still want to have a conversation and **we can make it a priority in our next committee meeting**. Someone did do the analysis on our behalf in the corpus and determined that there was 2 uses of the question mark in a variable name. **I think it's something that we could possibly do as an experimental feature early in 7.2 [...] it's tricky [...] it's not a zero-cost thing [...] not a huge priority right now, so I don't want to guarantee that that's happening.**\r\n\r\nPriority is a separate issue, but I do hope this issue won't fall through the cracks, which seems to be a real possibility, given how the debate has unfolded (see timeline below).\r\n\r\nTo frame the issue in the context of the breaking-change debate:\r\n\r\n* The _benefit_ of the change is: Without it, the utility of the new null-conditional access operators will be severely hampered, because _users won't expect to have to enclose the variable name in `{... }` in order to use it_; with `Set-StrictMode -Version 1` or higher, you'll at least get an error (because `$foo?.bar` then requires the existence of `${foo?}`), but with strict mode off the code will simply not do what users expect, [as pointed out by @rkeithhill and acknowledged as a problem by you](https://youtu.be/IHMgWobHzrI?t=2779).\r\n\r\n* As for whose code will break due to the change: if the corpus is representative, virtually _nobody's_ - see below.\r\n\r\n* As for @rjmholt's syntax-change concerns: this is _not_ a syntax change, but a _semantic_ one: old code won't _break during parsing_, it'll simply _behave differently_ - and since there is virtually no code like that in existence, this is a moot point.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nTimeline:\r\n\r\n* The original request, #11379, is opened on Dec 17, 2019.\r\n\r\n* It is [closed on Aug 26, 2019](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11379#issuecomment-681155223) after the committee decides it would be too much of a breaking change, following analysis of the corpus. \"there was quite a bit of usage of variable names ending with the question mark\"\r\n\r\n* A [request to show the original analysis](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11379#issuecomment-682014513) that the committee decision was based on is ignored.\r\n\r\n* The community does their own analysis, with the heavy lifting performed by @ThomasNieto; [further analysis](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11379#issuecomment-689858916) finds virtually _no_ usage of variable names ending in `?`:  _one_(!) bona fide instance in the corpus, with the majority of the occurrences - limited to 8 files in total - showing _mistaken_ usage of `?` inside _expandable strings_ (e.g., `\"Are you sure you want to kill $vParam?\"`), which implicitly makes the case for the requested change: _users do not and should not expect `?` to be usable in a variable name without `{...}`_.\r\n\r\n\r\n* A [request to reopen the original issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11379#issuecomment-698478048) on 24 Sep, after a discussion in the Sep 17 community call, is ignored.\r\n\r\n* This issue is opened on Nov 10, as a reminder to reopen the original one, along with [addressing](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14025#issue-740119106) the [arguments made by @SteveLee in the Sep 17 community call](https://youtu.be/nW4OxHNSng0?t=2609).\r\n\r\n* The issue is discussed again in the Nov 19 community call, where [@SteveLee in essence repeats his arguments from the Sept. call](https://youtu.be/IHMgWobHzrI?t=2050), showing no awareness of the counterarguments that have been made, and notably repeating the claim \"I think we did some research and there are people who use this, so we don't want to break them\" and saying \"I don't think this really that much of a pain point that we want to keep revisiting\". Later in the call this is tempered by [@joeyaiello's acknowledgement of the problem](https://youtu.be/IHMgWobHzrI?t=2446).\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the above is liable to erode the community's confidence that its concerns and feedback are taken seriously.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "When I first discovered the Null-coalescing operators introduce in v7 I was initially pleased. That is until I started reading the ugly details and starting experimenting with this.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, this is another example of being held back by prior bad design choices that just goes on to haunt us for evermore, instead of making a corrective breaking change. What value is there for being able to use a '?' in a variable name? It has next to no value but high restraining and detrimental impact. Why can't we have a breaking change that removes this? Having to use those {} just to appease variables names with a question mark is a case of the tail wagging the dog. Sure, there will be some code will be impacted. But if you document it well and SHOUT about it, make it easy for users to upgrade their code, possibly via a new new PSSA warning, then I think that would be better for all of us. The use of the {} really is aweful and should be fixed.\r\n\r\nI'm experimenting with test code at the moment and have a test that refers to a PSCustomObject $_options, which contains nested members. I need to access $_options.Tags.From in a safe way.\r\n\r\nTags is known to never be null, but From is optional. So when you use coalescing, do you apply that to the whole path at once, or do you use the ?. on each sub member. When I try the latter (this scenario is missing from the help doc),  it doesnt work because the sub member access is referenced independently, not as a member.\r\n\r\nassuming:\r\n```powershell\r\n        $_options.Tags = [PSCustomObject]@{\r\n          From = '3.0.0';\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n```powershell\r\n# no coalescing, this is ok, but potentially unsafe, if From doesnt exist (I think)\r\n\r\nif ($_options.Tags.From) {\r\n```\r\n---\r\n```powershell\r\n# this doesnt work\r\n# => RuntimeException: The variable '$Tags' cannot be retrieved because it has not been set.\r\n#\r\nif (${_options}?.${Tags}.From) {\r\n```\r\n---\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# this doesnt work\r\n# => The variable '$_options.Tags' cannot be retrieved because it has not been set.\r\nif (${_options.Tags}?.From) {\r\n```\r\n\r\nso what is the correct and safe way to coalesc the entire path from _options right down to From? And also, do the rules apply the same inside of a class method as opposed to a function or script?\r\n\r\n...and the strange thing is this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n        if ($_options.Tags.To) {\r\n          Write-Host \"---> (PLAIN) TO: '$($_options.Tags.To)'\"\r\n        }\r\n        else {\r\n          Write-Host \"---> (PLAIN) TO: MISSING\"\r\n        }\r\n```\r\nprints:\r\n\r\n> ---> (PLAIN) TO: MISSING\r\n\r\nand in fact this is the functionality I want, but I fear it is unsafe, but I dont know why. And if this works, why do we need the coalesc  operator. I though the operator was introduced to prevent accessing a non existing member as in this case, from returning error, but return $null instead.\r\n\r\nPS, I'm using strict mode 1\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Imagine the script will receive a JSON payload, then convert it to a `PSObject` and access its members -- you don't know what actual payload you will receive, so there is no way to guarantee the ahead-of-time checking on the member accessing.\r\n\r\n> I think quite a few folks expected the ?. operator to pull double duty as doing that as well.\r\n\r\nIf there is such an ask, then we can discuss/debate on whether that's reasonable and worth to have. But for its current behavior regarding strict mode, I don't think it's fair to say it's broken. It's just a syntactic sugar today, and it does what it's supposed to do as a syntactic sugar, nothing more.",
