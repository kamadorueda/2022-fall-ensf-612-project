I want the ability to keep track of the version for that function. If I run Get-Command Get-CompanyFoo, I need to be able to see a version number.  For that matter, even in a module, all exported functions share the same version number. I'd like a facility to track version information on a per-function basis. And of course, without having to rely on reading the source code.  If a help desk technician is using one of my functions, they need to be able to use PowerShell to discover the command version.\r\n\r\nCertainly, not every function needs this, even those in a module.

    "body": "I definitely write/use some standalone functions, but most are in modules. And most of those are random flotsam tools that *can* be used as standalone functions. I always put semantic versions and changelogs in `.NOTES`  within the comment block, and a `[version]$Version` in the begin block, because I want to keep track of what changes I made to a particular function, not just to the module (which I increment when I make changes to the inner functions). Having something like `[version()]` or `[cmdletbinding(Version='01.00.0000')]` would be spectacular; I like it better than .VERSION because I know a lot of people put multiple functions into a psm1 file (although I don't).  \r\nI use git, also, btw, but I don't commit every time I make a change to an individual function; I bundle them up and commit when I change the module, usually w the module version as the commit message. Yeah, yeah, I know, I'm weird. ",

All I'd like is a mechanism to provide a way to track and discover version information so that if I run Get-Command, or perhaps a new command like Get-Function, I can see some metadata about the function.

If I can specify and query function versions, wouldn't it be sensible to allow execution based on version number?  \r\n\r\nEither a way to load multiple versions of a function and be able to pick the one to execute, or enable the user to choose amongst different versions to load into the function list we see with gcm and then execute that one. \r\n",

Having separate versions for each function would not be helpful, it would just be confusing. Regardless of how you distribute your code, you're not distributing sub-file \"hunks\" and the user can't load an individual function (or anything except a full file) -- so there's no point in trying to version them.\r\n\r\nI think we need versions for modules and scripts. Functions should inherit their version from the _module_ that contains them. Scripts need their own version.\r\n\r\n#### For the record: \r\n\r\nIf you have a .ps1 file that has multiple functions in it, you need to change the extension. If you don't, then users have no way to discover those functions anyway, so versioning won't matter. We should actively discourage anyone trying to distribute _functions_ in anything but a module. 🤨\r\n",

We are TOO close to RTM to be shoving new features into the mix. I have bad memories of NT 5 days!!

It also not clear what the expected behavior would be if the script function is within a module, but has its own version attribute.  Then there is concern about other parts of PowerShell, PowerShellGet, and PSGallery that would need to be updated to respect this new attribute.  If the desire is to be able to pass around a single script file vs a folder (module), then it would be better to invest in the ability to [import a zip/nupkg module directly](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7259) and easier to turn a .ps1 into a module.",

There's not a whole lot to it.\r\n\r\n> It's not relevant to me. It provides me NO VALUE.\r\n\r\nIf you're publishing something for others to consume it definitely provides value.  The way scopes work for modules make it a lot harder to step on someone's global session state and vice versa.  That makes your function significantly more resilient to unexpected differences in environments.\r\n\r\nIt's also way easier to consume.  If you release a function as a script folks need to dot source, they need to know where it is, dot source it, then use the command.  If you release it as a module, folks can just deploy it ahead of time and call it whenever they want.\r\n\r\n> how does the committee suggest that versioning for functions/filters be done?\r\n\r\nIf versioning was implemented for individual functions, would you expect their version to be queryable?\r\n\r\nIf yes, can you elaborate a little bit on what scenario you would expect the user to query it?  Would you expect it to play into any other systems like `#requires` tags?\r\n\r\nIf it would just be metadata visible in the source then you could just put it in the `NOTES` section of comment based help.",

Most of my career was spent thinking the hashtable syntax was \"the splatting syntax\".  Most of my coworkers only know the absolute basics of PowerShell (if at all), same with most of the people I help on discord/reddit.\r\n\r\nI get that you have some beef with the PS dev team, but please don't pretend like I couldn't possibly understand your perspective because I happen to know C# now. I'm constantly fighting for that perspective on this repo.\r\n\r\n> think \"just make it a module\". Most admin scripters aren't going to know how and they'll say (and I'll agree) that it's too much trouble once they see the requirements.\r\n\r\nFor anyone who comes across this thread later and gets discouraged from making a module, here are the requirements:\r\n\r\n1. Rename your `.ps1` file to `.psm1`\r\n1. Use `Import-Module ./file.psm1` instead of `. ./file.ps1`\r\n\r\nThat's it, you got a module.  Everything else is just best practices you don't need to worry about yet.  If you want to version it you need a manifest, here's the full requirements for that:\r\n\r\n1. Rename your `.ps1` file to `.psm1`\r\n1. Run `New-ModuleManifest -RootModule ./file.psm1 -Path ./file.psd1 -ModuleVersion 1.0.0`\r\n1. Use `Import-Module ./file.psd1` instead of `. ./file.ps1`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you're shipping a loose function in a ps1 that the consumer (or yourself) would need to dot source, just throw it in a module real quick it'll make your life easier.\r\n\r\nIf you're shipping a directly invokable script, you can use `New-ScriptFileInfo` which will generate a script file with a comment like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n<#PSScriptInfo\r\n\r\n.VERSION 1.0.0\r\n\r\n.GUID xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx\r\n\r\n.AUTHOR username\r\n\r\n.COMPANYNAME\r\n\r\n.COPYRIGHT\r\n\r\n.TAGS\r\n\r\n.LICENSEURI\r\n\r\n.PROJECTURI\r\n\r\n.ICONURI\r\n\r\n.EXTERNALMODULEDEPENDENCIES \r\n\r\n.REQUIREDSCRIPTS\r\n\r\n.EXTERNALSCRIPTDEPENDENCIES\r\n\r\n.RELEASENOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n.PRIVATEDATA\r\n\r\n#>\r\n\r\n<# \r\n.DESCRIPTION \r\n     Quick script description here.\r\n#> \r\nparam()\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd you can query that with `Test-ScriptFileInfo`.",
