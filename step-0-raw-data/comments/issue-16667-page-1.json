    "body": "Hello, @iSazonov . Thank you again for your help, and I apologize for the delay. My update is puzzling. I swear that in real life I am a sane and very technically competent person who has never even been drunk. I have a wonderful wife and four awesome adult children, and I'm even nice to dogs, but to you, I do this. My apologies. Here's what I have:\r\n\r\n1. On one of my laptops, running Windows 10 21H1 (OS Build 19043.1415) Enterprise, it all just suddenly worked. VS Code asked me again if I wanted to upgrade pwsh, and not wanting to miss out on any chance that things might somehow work, I said yes again. And this time, it worked.\r\n2. On my other laptop, running Windows 11 Version Dev (OS Build 22523.1000) Pro Insider Preview, I am still unable to install pwsh 7.2.1. However, just to make things more interesting, I can't uninstall it either. This seems like an edge case that you (MS) may not want to work on with me if I'm the only one reporting it. If that's the case, that's fine. I work in a somewhat similar position, so I get it. If we don't chase this down, are there any instructions on how to manually perform a complete uninstallation of pwsh 7.2.0? If that's possible, I'm certainly willing to go that route. I already have a \"last resort\" plan: I did an administrative installation and I can run pwsh 7.2.1 directly from the folder it created (but that workaround feels pretty \"dirty\"). Advice?\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time.",
