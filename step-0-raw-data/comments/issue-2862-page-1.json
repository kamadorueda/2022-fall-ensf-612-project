Yes, those double casting should be avoid, but like @2xmax mentioned it will increase nesting, which is also annoying.

I'm not sure if it's really a potential bug, or it's OK because the value can only be one of JArray, JObject and JValue. @2xmax can you comment? If it's a potential bug, then we can open an issue to track it.\r\n\r\nAccording to this [doc](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json/help/html/SerializationGuide.htm), there be no other value except JArray, JObject, and JValue but maybe it is still worth to examine [the Json.NET unit test suite](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/tree/master/Src/Newtonsoft.Json.Tests/Linq) in details; I haven't found any contradiction, yet I feel like maybe we could beware of a breaking change (e.g. caused by the nuget package update) by writing some tests [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/test/powershell/SDK/Json.Tests.ps1).\r\n\r\n> For these untyped properties, the Json.NET serializer will read the JSON into LINQ to JSON objects and set them to the property. JObject will be created for JSON objects; JArray will be created for JSON arrays, and JValue will be created for primitive JSON values\r\n\r\n",
