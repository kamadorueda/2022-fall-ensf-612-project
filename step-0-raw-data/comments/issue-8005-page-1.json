But this doesn't address a general terminating exception.\r\n> - Catch all terminating exceptions (in EndInvoke) and insert into Error stream, marking the error as terminating in some way.\r\n> - Create a new \"EndInvoke\" exception class that is thrown, which wraps the actual terminating error and also provides the output buffer as a parameter.",

Once the code is in use I think it would be more common to rethrow or change code paths (and if you *do* absolutely need it, the other overload is still available to you).\r\n\r\nThat said, my main concern isn't really about the output and more about changing the behavior of `EndInvoke`. \r\n\r\nSince the output collection is stored internally on the `PowerShellAsyncResult` returned by `BeginInvoke`, would it make sense to instead have a new method that can retrieve the output? e.g.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic PSDataCollection<PSObject> GetAsyncOutput(IAsyncResult);\r\n````",
