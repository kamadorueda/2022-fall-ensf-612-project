This includes tokens.\r\n- You may encounter complexity with composite tokens, which are ones that in my opinion the tokeniser doesn't handle very well. But you should still have enough information in the token string to do the right thing given enough determination.\r\n\r\nI believe the current token is available here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c909541b7797b60462188a4abe9592a8763c1fbb/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandCompletion/CompletionAnalysis.cs#L22-L24\r\n\r\nand the full token array is available here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c909541b7797b60462188a4abe9592a8763c1fbb/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandCompletion/CompletionAnalysis.cs#L62\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to search backward through the token array if need be.\r\n\r\nIf the token up to that point isn't available, I don't think there's a way of piercing through the tokeniser abstraction to see the raw input currently, but the right way to do that would be to expose it as a token anyway.",
