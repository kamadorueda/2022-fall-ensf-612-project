    "body": "What's the actual real benefit here? Because TabCompletion is for completing to `Full Command names` which in this case includes the `.exe` or `.ps1` whilst the engine will look to the command values you can see with the below you could technically brake all scripts that don't reference the full `powershell.exe` with the following\r\n\r\n``` powershell\r\nfunction powershell { \"Whoops you broke using PowerShell for PowerShell.exe in the terminal due to command preference - for more info run 'Get-Help about_Command_Precedence'\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen tab complete and you would have a PowerShell Function as well as the PowerShell Application `powershell.exe`\r\nfor more info on command preference have a look at ` Get-Help about_Command_Precedence`\r\n\r\nAlso - `This would make the behavior similar to how the search for executable scripts work.` - technically this is incorrect as per the below tabcompletion for slmgr.vbs which is an executable script and also shows the extension as per mentioned above (and IMO always should)\r\n```Powershell \r\nCd C:\\\r\nslmg\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason at the prompt I think that you should always be shown the file extension is that you may have scripts in different languages but are still executable scripts and share the same file name - build scripts are like this on xPlat projects\r\n\r\nTake the following (in an admin prompt if you have v6 installed then this will work as it's a location on $env:Path)\r\n``` powershell\r\nNew-Item \"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6\\slmgr.ps1\" -Value 'Write-Host \"This is not the Slmgr vb executable script\"'\r\n```\r\nnow in the console type slm and tab complete\r\n\r\nThat's when you need to have the file extension and why I can't see any real benefit behind removing the extension from the returned completed commands and IMO actually hampers the UX - yes the extension may be surplus to most requirements but as it doesn't impact performance by doing what it's intended to do, whereas your suggested change would add lots of overhead with potential perf losses and be of marginal gain to not only the everyday Windows Scripter but also be a possible downturn on the xPlat ones as well.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts on this :-)\r\n\r\n",
