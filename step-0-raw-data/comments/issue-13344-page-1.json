What about `WindowsApplication`  on Windows, in the future?\r\n\r\nEither way, for now we should throw an error for `ConsoleApplication` on parameter validation, and for `WindowsApplication` on Unix.\r\n\r\nOnly if we never expect these things to work should we deprecated the `-OutputType` parameter altogether (in which case `-OutputType Library` would be invariably implied).\r\n",
