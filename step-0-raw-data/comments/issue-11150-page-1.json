    "body": "@PaulHigin Thanks Paul, I had read through that. Here's the parts that threw me a bit:\r\n\r\n1) How to get the results:\r\n\r\n> \"You can use Receive-PSSession rather than using the Connect-PSSession cmdlet. If the session is already reconnected, Receive-PSSession gets the results of commands that ran when the session was disconnected. If the PSSession is still disconnected, Receive-PSSession connects to it and then gets the results of commands that ran while it was disconnected. Receive-PSSession can return the results in a job (asynchronously) or to the host program (synchronously). Use the OutTarget parameter to select Job or Host. The default value is Host. However, if the command that's being received was started in the current session as a Job, it's returned as a Job by default.\"\r\n\r\nThe return value of Receive-PSSession was unclear to me from this. Reading this, I thought that unless I specified out target as a job, it would return either the results of the command I invoked via Invoke-Command or attempt to reconnect and return nothing if the job hadn't finished. However, when I actually tested I saw I got a job even though I did *not* specify out target as a job. Is that expected?\r\n\r\n2. State and Availability properties\r\n\r\nIn this section all the examples of busy sections were disconnected and busy was defined as:\r\n>A value of Busy indicates that you can't connect to the PSSession because it's connected to another session.\r\n\r\nSo, when I waited a bit on the job I got from Receive-PsSession I was pretty confused when I got a session that was opened/busy. I'm assuming that's because when the session reconnected the invoke-command I had run previously would continue meaning I couldn't send more to the session, but I'm still not certain I get the semantics here.\r\n\r\n3. Based on 2, it seems like the job I get finishes when *both* the session reconnects and the previous command I invoked via invoke-command finishes. Assuming this is correct, it's mildly annoying now to do a reconnect timer because the job is waiting on both those things to finish -- not just the session reconnect. It's surmountable of course with a small window where I check if the session is now opened but the job is still busy, but it's much less simple than passing a simple timeout.\r\n\r\nHere's roughly what I ended up with after *a lot* of fiddling. I've seen it work correctly a few times as far as I can tell from the print statements.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$results = Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock {...}\r\n\r\nwhile ($session.State -like \"Disconnected\")\r\n{\r\n        Write-Warning \"Attempting to reconnect for up to 6 more minutes...\"\r\n\r\n        # Reconnect waiting 6 more minutes on top of the standard 4 (10 total)\r\n        $job = Receive-PSSession $session\r\n        for($i = 0; $i -lt 6 -and $session.State -like \"Disconnected\"; $i++)\r\n        {\r\n            Write-Warning \"Continue attempting to reconnect to $($session.ComputerName) ...\"\r\n            Wait-Job $job -Timeout 60\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        # If the session has reconnected, continue to wait for the test to finished\r\n        if ($session.State -like \"Opened\")\r\n        {\r\n            Write-Warning \"The network connection to $($session.ComputerName) has been restored.\"\r\n            $results = Receive-Job $job -Wait\r\n        }\r\n        else\r\n        {\r\n            break\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "`Receive-PSSession` will return a job by default if the original session was created as a job, or otherwise it just returns the output data.  But you can always ensure what form you get by using the `-OutTarget` parameter.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nReceive-PSSession -OutTarget <Host | Job>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYes, unfortunately the PSSession state during a disconnect/reconnect is very confusing.  We tried to squeeze disconnect semantics into existing State and Availability fields.  Anyway, here is what each combination means:\r\n\r\n`State==Opened, Availability==Busy`            ->  Client is connected to Target and Target is running\r\n`State==Opened, Availability==Available`     ->  Client is connected to Target and Target is idle\r\n`State==Disconnected, Availability==None`   ->  Client is disconnected from Target but can connect\r\n`State==Disconnected, Availability==Busy`    ->  Target is connected to some other client.  This client cannot connect.\r\n\r\nWhen a session is disconnected (for whatever reason, network flakiness or manually), if script/command is running on the Target, it will continue to run although in a 'disconnected' state.  This is complicated if the script returns data.  The data can't be transferred to the client so it will be cached on the Target but only up to 1MB (I think is the limit).  After that the script will block and cannot continue until a client connects to receive data.  Unless you opted for a PSSession with `-OutBufferMode` set to 'Drop', in which case the Target script continues to run but output data is dropped after the cache is filled.\r\n\r\nIn any case, once you reconnect a client to a Target PSSession, if that session was/is running it needs to complete before you can run more script commands on it.  'Complete' may mean the script actually needs to finish running, or it may mean that cached output data needs to be transferred to the client.  Once both those things occur then the script 'completes' and the session becomes available for more work:\r\n\r\n`State==Opened, Availability==Available`\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Yes, exactly. I'm stumped. To be clear, this happens <1/10 times -- most of the time it works just fine. I see the standard disconnect messages, and my code actually even checks that the session is disconnected before running the Receive, but then receive tells me I'm no longer disconnected and the session state agrees. The logs I get are above, word for word minus xx'ing out the IP. The error message I get when I try to run Receive-PsSession is incorporated in the last log line I pasted: \"There is no disconnected command associated with this runspace.\" -- all I did is also include the session state when I logged that. I don't have multiple sessions and I'm not doing anything in parallel outside of this script or anything. Pasting the updated code below so you can map it to the log output, but the only change truly is logging and the -OutTarget Job change.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$results = Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock {...}\r\n\r\nwhile ($session.State -like \"Disconnected\")\r\n{\r\n        Write-Warning \"Attempting to reconnect for up to 6 more minutes...\"\r\n\r\n        # Reconnect waiting 6 more minutes on top of the standard 4 (10 total)\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            $job = Receive-PSSession $session -OutTarget Job\r\n        }\r\n        catch\r\n        {\r\n            LogError \"Reconnect attempt failed.

This works in Windows PowerShell but not in recent versions of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\nMore Info:\r\nWhen an Invoke-Command session is disconnected, a temporary job object is created to facilitate a session running command re-connection.  The bug is that the temporary job object is not created correctly.\r\n\r\nPossible workaround:\r\nThe reconnect should work if you run Invoke-Command as a job:\r\n```powershell\r\n$results = Invoke-Command -session $session -Script {...} -AsJob | Receive-Job -Wait\r\n...\r\n```",
