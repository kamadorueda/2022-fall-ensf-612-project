The only way known to me is something like this:\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Whatever 2>&1 |\r\n  ForEach-Object {\r\n    if ($_ -is [ErrorRecord]) {\r\n      # handle error\r\n    } else {\r\n      $_\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the `break` and `continue` seem weird to me because this is a scriptblock, not a loop.\r\nWhy not continue by default, and break with `throw`? That would be more intuitive to me",
