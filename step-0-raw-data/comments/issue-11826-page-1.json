    "body": "@iSazonov @mikeTWC1984 Code has been modified per your suggestions:\r\n\r\n[Modified code](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/4203700/Sample_Show-OnlineHosts.txt)\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n  1. Removing calls to `Write-Debug` has made troubleshooting this issue easier, but does not explain the discrepancy in behavior between versions. Does this discrepancy warrant further investigation?\r\n  2. `$socket.Connect()` was indeed unnecessary, but removing it had no appreciable impact on runtime or monitored resource usage.\r\n  3. The pool size was set to such an admittedly insane number to facilitate speed with the original code. Reducing this value would lower memory usage, but would greatly increase runtime.\r\n  4. Using `$socket = [Net.Sockets.TcpClient]::new()` and `$task = $socket.ConnectAsync($ip, $port)` reduces runtime and virtually eliminates the difference in runtime between versions, in all stages.\r\n  5. In conjunction with (4) above, reducing the pool size to (threads)x1.25 also greatly reduces memory usage, while maintaining an acceptable level of speed.\r\n  6. Eliminating runspaces reduces memory usage even further, but a brief timeout is required between connection attempts before success can be verified, and even a small timeout (0.1s) severely slows down processing when hundreds of addresses are scanned sequentially. Thus, runspaces have been preserved.\r\n  7. Data points have been stored in `$results` for easier retrieval.\r\n\r\nSample output:\r\n`PS 7-preview> soh -Force -Verbose`\r\n```\r\nVERBOSE: Starting function . . .\r\nVERBOSE: [Startup] : Begin\r\nVERBOSE: Initializing . . . \r\nVERBOSE: Total network(s) detected       : 2\r\nVERBOSE: Address(es) to scan per network : 256\r\nVERBOSE: Generating list of IP address(es) to scan . . . \r\nVERBOSE: List of IP address(es) to scan successfully generated. \r\nVERBOSE: Total address(es) to scan       : 512\r\nVERBOSE: Creating and opening runspace pool with 20 thread(s) . . . \r\nVERBOSE: Runspace pool successfully created and opened. \r\nVERBOSE: [Startup] completed in 0.031 seconds.\r\nVERBOSE: Memory usage : Current 52.281 MB / Peak 52.281 MB\r\nVERBOSE: Total runtime : 0.046 seconds.\r\nVERBOSE: Continuing . . .\r\nVERBOSE: [RunspaceSetup] : Begin\r\nVERBOSE: Generating runspace(s) . . .\r\nVERBOSE: [RunspaceSetup] completed : 512 runspace(s) in 0.174 seconds.\r\nVERBOSE: Memory usage : Current 88.734 MB / Peak 88.734 MB\r\nVERBOSE: Total runtime : 0.233 seconds.\r\nVERBOSE: [Scan] : Begin\r\nVERBOSE: Scanning network(s) . . .\r\nVERBOSE: Total detected host(s) : 1\r\nVERBOSE: [Scan] completed : 512 address(es) in 2.525 seconds.\r\nVERBOSE: Memory usage : Current 101.719 MB / Peak 101.719 MB\r\nVERBOSE: Total runtime : 2.767 seconds.\r\nVERBOSE: [Cleanup] : Begin\r\nVERBOSE: Performing post-processing and cleanup . . .\r\nVERBOSE: [Cleanup] completed in 0.005 seconds.\r\nVERBOSE: Memory usage : Current 100.988 MB / Peak 101.832 MB\r\nVERBOSE: Total runtime : 2.779 seconds.\r\nVERBOSE: Exiting gracefully. Total time to execute : 2.783 seconds.\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless I'm missing something, it appears that the original's time and memory discrepancies between versions can be explained by some garbage code on my part. Thank you for the advice! Please let me know if I may be of further assistance.",

    "body": "@iSazonov That is correct. Runtime is now pretty consistent for me across versions, and is faster than ever. Memory usage, both peak and current measured after cleanup, has also been reduced across versions. In fact, peak memory usage in core is now consistently around 1/3 that of v5.1, and core is now using less memory at completion than v5.1. Combined with the reduced runtime, this is a complete reversal of the situation that originally prompted me to submit this issue.\r\n\r\n@mikeTWC1984 On my end at least, generating runspaces is still nearly 2x faster in v5.1 than it is in core. However, with the dramatic reduction in threads, the difference is now only fractions of a second instead of several seconds. Agreed on memory usage per thread. What I still don't really understand is why executing the runspaces initially took ~ 20x longer in core, or why it was initially using much more memory in core.",
