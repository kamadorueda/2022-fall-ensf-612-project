Note that if you want to use _PowerShell_'s wildcards in this scenario, use `-Include` rather than `-Filter`. Not sure if the backtick problems affect `-Include` too, but at least it works with the failing command in the initial post: ``gci -include '*`[defg-0 hijk -lmn`].pdf' -Recurse``\r\n\r\n",

I forget this and rediscover it about once every couple of years. I asked a group of experts and everyone initially thought literal path is just path without wildcard processing.\r\n\r\n`dir -Recurse -Path  \"profile.ps1\" `  works like  `dir  -Recurse -Include \"profile.ps1\" ` ,   and \r\n`dir -Recurse -LiteralPath \"profile.ps1\" `  does something different.    \r\nThe help descriptions of `path` and `literalPath` don't lead people to understanding the difference and there are no `literalpath` examples. It is working as designed, but the design comes as a surprise to many.  \r\n\r\n` dir -Recurse -literalpath .\\PowerShell\\readme.md `  tries to recurse through  a non-existent readme.md directory but   \r\n` dir -Recurse -path .\\PowerShell\\readme.md ` recurses through all subdirectories looking for readme.md  -path seems to split into parent and child parts, and do different things if the child is a file or a directory. \r\n\r\n`Include` has its own annoyances\r\n1. without `-recurse` neither  `dir -include profile.ps1` nor `dir  . -include profile.ps1` return a file from the current directory, one must specify `dir * -include profile.ps1` (nothing would break if the cmdlet assumed *). \r\n2.  `dir -path .\\PowerShell\\,.\\WindowsPowerShell\\ -Include profile.ps1` returns nothing (it requires `.\\PowerShell\\*,.\\WindowsPowerShell\\*`  and again * could be assumed) but...\r\n3.  `-Include` and `-exclude` don't apply when used with literalpath  (`dir -LiteralPath .\\PowerShell -Include *.psm1`  returns everything)\r\n\r\nFortunately the bug in this issue - which I think is validating the path parameter - does not affect `-Include` so        \r\n```dir -include '* `[defg-0 hijk -lmn`].Txt' -Recurse```  works \r\n\r\nThis is all harder than it needs to be :-( \r\n\r\n",
