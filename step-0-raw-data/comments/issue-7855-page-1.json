    "body": "Thanks, @BrucePay, but further clarification is needed:\r\n\r\nTo quote @SteveL-MSFT's summary:\r\n\r\n> The current use of -Raw is acceptable and therefore no reason to make the proposed change. We would support a proposal to add a type parameter for streaming line-by-line w/o annotations although we did not come to agreement on the naming. -Bare is not different enough from -Raw to communicate functional differences.\r\n\r\nThis tells me that the decision was entirely focused on rejecting the proposal to deprecate `-Raw` _as currently used with `Get-Content`_, and what to name the new parameter that fits the pattern described in this issue _in the context of `Get-Content`_.\r\n\r\nAside from my obvious preference for this deprecation (without removal - I'll stop saying that now, consider it implied; \"deemphasizing\" is just too clunky), **_this_ proposal's gist is to _introduce a general parameter pattern_ with _a_ shared name** - while my naming preference is clearly `-Bare`, that is just _one_ suggestion.\r\n\r\n**Committing to this pattern means the newly agreed-upon name should be used in  #7713, #7537, and perhaps #5797, as well as going forward.**\r\n\r\nBy your own reasoning,\r\n\r\n> \"Raw\" in this context means, \"undecorated\", \"not cooked\", etc.\r\n> In PowerShell we try to choose a single term and apply it consistently so that, even if it does not seem intuitive to a person, they only have to learn it once. Sometimes we choose a sub-optimal term but we live with it because you should only have to learn something once. \r\n> [...] use the existing pattern -Raw as the parameter to indicate that an object should be returned unadorned.\r\n\r\nIn other words, this issue:\r\n\r\n* just asks more formally for defining and establishing the use of a `-Raw`-like parameter pattern.\r\n\r\n* and to you `-Raw` is an acceptable name for this general pattern, because what `Get-Content -Raw` currently does fits in as well, correct?\r\n\r\nIf so, and everyone's happy with this `-Raw` deal (if you will), then that leaves just one, incidental question:\r\n\r\nWhat to name the new _streaming line-by-line w/o annotations_ parameter for `Get-Content`, given that `-Raw` is already taken there. \r\nGiven the `-Raw` deal, the name `-RawLines`, which [you yourself have pondered](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7537#issuecomment-413461691), sounds just fine to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Y'know, thinking on that a bit, @mklement0, although it would be a more significant change... I would consider simply *replacing* the `-Raw` parameter with your proposed `-RawLines` parameter.\n\nThere's no need for an extra parameter; as has been noted in the associated issues at least once, `-ReadCount` can already be used to read the file in one go. Additionally, use of that *is* backwards compatible.\n\nSo while old code would need to be updated to work properly with the new version (thus a breaking change, I suppose), new code would be relatively backwards compatible, *if* the read-all-at-once was all that it was being used for. And if the undecorated output was required, it would be restricted to the newer versions.",

    "body": "I went exploring, and maybe irrelevant but for the record, found a few other more things which, if you squint a bit, fit this issue's described pattern of asking a cmdlet to return a more basic output, or switch to another commonly desired output, or do less work for improved performance. Not all related to \"undecorated\" output, exactly:\r\n\r\n - `Get-Date` returns a `[DateTime]`, and `-Format 'yyyy-mm-dd'` returns `[string]`.\r\n - `Test-Connection` returns `[TestConnectionCommand+PingReport]`, and `-Quiet` returns `[bool]`.\r\n - `ConvertTo-Xml` returns `[XmlDocument]`, and `-As String` makes it return a `[string]`.\r\n - `Get-Variable` returns `[PSVariable]` but with `-ValueOnly` it returns just the variable value.\r\n - `Get-CimInstance` has `-KeyOnly` and `-Shallow` to ask it to get less information (KeyOnly is documented as \"[returns key parameters only ..] reduces the amount of data transferred over the network.\" - presumably that's a performance reason).\r\n - `Get-ComputerInfo -Property BiosCaption` asks it to return less information, just like feeding it through `| select BiosCaption` would .. but apparently still makes you wait as long as it takes to get all the information, so it doesn't seem to be a performance reason. Help says it \"Specifies, as a string array, the computer properties in which this cmdlet displays.\" as if it's intended to be an output *display* option for a user.\r\n - `Measure-Command` returns `[GenericMeasureInfo]` but with `-Lines` it switches to `[TextMeasureInfo]` (to try and behave like the `wc` utility?).\r\n \r\nand existing in Windows PowerShell, but not PS 6.1:\r\n\r\n - `Get-Clipboard` has a `-Raw` parameter which ignores newlines.\r\n - `Get-EventLog` has `-AsBaseObject` which \"Indicates that this cmdlet returns a standard System.Diagnostics.EventLogEntry object for each event. Without this parameter, Get-EventLog returns an extended PSObject object with additional EventLogName, Source, and InstanceId properties.\"",

    "body": "Thanks, @HumanEquivalentUnit.\r\n\r\nThe  patterns I see in your examples is to ask for an _alternative_ output data type or only _part of_ the usual output objects.\r\n\r\nWith respect to an alternative data type, it is what the `-As<type>` switches in _some_ of the examples do.\r\n\r\nYou could argue that `-ValueOnly` should therefore be `-AsValue`, and `-Quiet` (which isn't really quiet, only _quieter_) should be `-AsBoolean`, and, though a less clear-cut case, perhaps `-KeyOnly` should be `-AsKey`.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, `Get-ChildItem`'s `-Name` could be `-AsName`, and it is an example of how the reasonable expectation that asking for something _simpler_ or for _less_ also results in _better performance_ doesn't always hold: see #9119 - just like you found with `Get-ComputerInfo -Property` in #9234.\r\n\r\n`Get-Clipboard`'s  use of `-Raw` is just as unfortunate as `Get-Content`'s - I've previously proposed \r\n`-Whole` in  #7715, but, based on the above, `-AsString` could work too (though, while more consistent, it is a tad more obscure in this specific case).\r\n\r\n`Get-EventLog`'s `-AsBaseObject` is a good example of what this issue calls for: requesting the usual output object, but _undecorated_ (without tacked-on ETS properties); thus, it should be `-Raw` (though I wonder if I've expressed my preference for `-Bare` before).\r\n\r\n`Measure-Object`'s  `-Line`, `-Word` and `-Character` switches are interesting, because they only not only result in a different type of output object, but also _change the input processing_ to count _inside_ of the input objects, i.e., the lines, words, and characters inside multi-line strings. `TextMeasureInfo` is derived from the abstract `MeasureInfo` class,  just like the default `GenericMeasureInfo` output type.",
