It already has this sort of behaviour with `-GroupBy` in any case, so it would be a matter of doing something similar-ish (though I don't think it should by default change the displayed *order* of items as that is disingenuous and does not represent the objects properly).",

    "body": "@jszabo98  \r\n> more than one object type is piped through it\r\n\r\nIn your example, there is, in fact, only one type of object going through the pipeline. In the cases where there actually are multiple types of objects e.g.\r\n```powershell\r\n $((get-process | select -first 1) ; get-date ; (get-process | select -first 1)) | ft\r\n```\r\nthe secondary objects are rendered as lists. \r\n\r\n@vexx32 Please consider the following scenario: one of the most commonly used commands is `Get-Childitem/dir/ls`. This command returns heterogeneous object types: `FileInfo` and `DirectoryInfo` depending on the contents of the directory. `DirectoryInfo` doesn't have a `Length` property but `FileInfo` does. Should we be warning on that? That would mean that pretty much every time you type `dir` you'd get a bunch of warnings. Not a good experience.  Alternatively, should we restart the table when we switch from object type to the other? If it happens once that might be OK but if it's happening every other record then you'd have poor experience, especially with a recursive `dir`. \r\n\r\nUltimately the current behavior of formatting and output is the result of a lot of testing focused on providing a good user experience (most of the time). It's certainly not perfect but it could be made much worse if we aren't careful.",

Obviously that has a custom format file because it's a core cmdlet, but in general that pattern wouldn't be terrible (not warning on objects that inherit from a common type). Granted, I'm not sure how you'd *code* for that at the moment, but it seems doable.\r\n\r\nI agree that the current situation is... probably the best of a bad lot, in some ways, but just because it *could* be made worse is no reason to avoid looking at ways to *improve* it as well.

We considered an lot of scenarios in building formatting and output (and PowerShell in general) and it's (hopefully) helpful to know some of the specific things we looked at.",

Is there something we could look at where, perhaps, situations like this are handled kind of like this?\r\n\r\n```\r\n# mock up\r\nname   address\r\n-----  -------\r\njoe    home\r\nSteve  work\r\n--------------\r\nName    :  Bill\r\nAddress :  Florida\r\nPhone   :  (772) 845-1189\r\n--------------\r\nJames  work\r\nJoan   home\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat would be *thoroughly* useful, I think, is for this display to be collapsible to hide the interloper objects (perhaps even by default, with a marker to be clicked on or notifying the user to press a key to show the interlopers).\r\n\r\nThat is a very display-only sort of solution, though, but that's really where this tends to hurt the most -- at least if users are *aware* there're interloper objects of different types than they might expect they can filter them out as needed. Not being shown them at all can make it very difficult to work with!",

    "body": "Your example (excluding the dashes) is more or less what we do today if we have type names and format data. (I assume that the 'Bill' record is actually a record with three fields and not inferred by joining two records.) In the absence of type names and information about how to format objects, a set of heuristics are used with questionable results. If there are fewer than 5 properties on the object then table formatting is used with the set of properties from the first object used as column headers. The formatter will then attempt to retrieve those properties from subsequent typeless objects. Absent properties are not treated as errors (like `Length` with `dir`) and additional properties are ignored (since objects typically have a large number of properties).  Beyond the threshold of 5 properties, list formatting is used for all objects so the 'hidden object' problem goes away:\r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore (1:303) >  [pscustomobject]@{name='joe';address='home'; a=1;b=2;c=3};  [pscustomobject]@{phone='1'}\r\n\r\nname    : joe\r\naddress : home\r\na       : 1\r\nb       : 2\r\nc       : 3\r\n\r\nphone : 1\r\n```\r\nIf you have typenames and format data, you get:\r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore (1:306) >  [pscustomobject]@{PSTypeName = \"Address\"; name='joe';address='home'};  [pscustomobject]@{phone='1'}\r\n\r\nName       Address\r\n----       -------\r\njoe        home\r\n\r\nphone : 1\r\n```\r\nIf we changed the formatter to synthasize a `View` for the first object if it was typeless, then you would get the above without having to provide additional information. That would fix this specific problem. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
