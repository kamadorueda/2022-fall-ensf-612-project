I ended up with something a bit different anyway, there are so many applications that assume bash as a shell, simple additions to the `.bashrc` that weren't working when using PS as a shell.  I also started using tmux so I've changed to using the following at the end of my .bashrc to spin up tmux or pwsh.\r\n\r\nI opened another issue here for a problem related to pwsh as a shell and SSH: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9842#issuecomment-517736879\r\n\r\nIt's a bit odd to fire up bash just to set up environment and then launch tmux or pwsh, but it works pretty well in practice, even across SSH to another host configured the same way, etc...\r\n\r\nI'm fine if you'd like to close either or both of these issues.",

    "body": "If you're able to test `pwsh-preview` in your environment it might help to make sure that this is not an ongoing issue.\r\n\r\nAlso I should note we don't execute `.bashrc`. On both Linux and macOS we use `/bin/sh` or another shell in POSIX shell mode, meaning `~/.profile` (or `/etc/profile`) is executed (rather than `.bash_login` or `.bash_profile` -- `.bashrc` is not a login profile so is not executed on login but rather shell process start). This is because the POSIX standard makes this more reliable and consistent across implementations (a number of Ubuntu installations, etc. don't have `bash` but do have a POSIX shell, like `dash`, since they must for POSIX compliance).\r\n\r\nIf you need more configurability there, it's worth opening a feature request. I will say that the login behaviour lies on the critical path for startup, so ideally the implementation can be kept as minimal as possible.",
