In French the thousand separator is a space and comma is the decimal point  but ...\r\n```\r\n[double]\"123,567\"\r\n123567\r\n\r\n> [double]\"1 234 567,00\"\r\nInvalidArgument: Cannot convert value \"1 234 567,00\" to type \"System.Double\"\r\n```\r\n\r\ncasting with `[double]` uses **invariant** so comma is the thousand separator and space isn't allowed.  \r\n\r\nIf I want to use something that I **know** is **local** format I can use `parse` (or the `[convert]` class) without identifying the culture:\r\n```\r\n> [double]::parse(\"1 234 567,00\")\r\n1234567\r\n\r\n>([double]::parse(\"1 234 567,00\")).tostring(\"E7\")\r\n1,2345670E+006\r\n\r\n[string][datetime]::parse(\"mercredi 19 janvier 2022\")\r\n01/19/2022 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nThe last one understands French (and only French) weekday and month names, -\"January\" would throw an error - and then `[string]` makes it invariant format (i.e. US Date and 24 hour clock).  I can also call parse with a culture to say \"This file was written with UK English, this one with US English, this one Canadian French, that one French French\" \r\n\r\nSo what do you think casting with `-As` does ? \r\n```\r\n> (\"mercredi 19 janvier 2022\" -as [datetime] ).tostring('d')\r\n19/01/2022\r\n\r\n $null -eq (\"1 234 567,00\" -as [double])\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n`-As`  returns null on a failed conversion and uses local for dates and invariant for numbers.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n> @MartinGC94 The issue question is about script vs C#, not cmdlet vs function.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov A trace shows that the parameter conversion is different depending on whether what is called is a a cmdlet written in C# and loaded from a .DLL  or an \"advanced function\" / \"script cmdlet\" . loaded from a PS1 file. \r\n\r\nThe result is if a module has commands that take date parameters, users need to know **how** those commands were implemented it. An author should be able to change that implementation detail without impacting the user, but as @MartinGC94  already said a proxy function for Get-Date would break existing scripts.   \r\n\r\nIf the first thing a user meets is a function that takes dates they expect  `Get-Date` to require invariant format. If the first thing they meet is `Get-Date` the expect local format to work anywhere. \r\n",
