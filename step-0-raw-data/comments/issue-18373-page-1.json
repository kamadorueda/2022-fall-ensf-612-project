The terminal , powershell, and Write-Progress can all display UTF 16 strings correctly. \r\nIf I switch to minimal view something like the € sign which is not in code page 437 or the ellipsis (…) which is a two-byte unicode character both cause failures with the **minimal view** \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/197985849-d9767954-8ba0-47da-8913-19e294282be3.png)\r\n \r\nThis issue should be have title like **Minimal view in Write-progress should not depend on code page settings** .
