    "body": "I never liked `-Raw`, and proposed `-Bare` as the name for a switch that generally omits output-object _decorations_ or _wrappers_ - remember #7855?\r\n\r\nAs such, `-Bare` would have been appropriate for `Select-String` too, not because it returns _strings_ as such, but because the _unwrapped_ objects are being returned, which just so happen to be strings.\r\n\r\n(For `Get-Content`, the current `-Raw` switch should never have been named that, but my proposal to have it renamed was rejected - see #7715. What _would_ deserve the name `-Raw` / `-Bare` is a behavior yet to be implemented - see #7537)\r\n\r\nIt looks like we're stuck with `-Raw` as the name for the not-string-specific pattern described above, so I think it is the right name here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
