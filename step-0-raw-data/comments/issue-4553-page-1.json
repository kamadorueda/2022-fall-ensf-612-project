If you run the lower part first then upper part, then all work fine.\r\nThis happens when a COM object is wrapped into a PSObject, which is the case when the COM object is returned from a pipeline, like the above repro code.\r\n\r\nI cannot open an issue until this PR is merged because the repro requires enumerating a COM collection.\r\nI have updated the test to not access `Name` member, so it would be good now. When I resolve the bug, I will update the COM basic test to keep accessing the `Name` member.",

Example: #2450\r\n- A PR is non-trivial and the history is clean, then it's worthy to keep the history. In this case, consider using `rebase and merge` to keep the main branch history clean if the number of commits is not too many (~5/6). Otherwise, use `create a merge commit`.\r\n- A PR may contain more than 1 fix, in this case we usually should ask the author to break it into two PRs.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from the main branch history, most of time we use (and prefer to) `squash and merge`.\r\n\r\nAs for what is a simple/complex/non-trivial fix/work, it's hard to describe but you will have your judgement call as you gain more expeirences.",
