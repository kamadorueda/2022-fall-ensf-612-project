Not sure how that would affect performance for piping it `Import-CSV | ConvertTo-DataTable` but that makes it so much more useful than tying it as a parameter.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the `-AsDataTable` purpose as apposed to e.g. `AsHashTable` (#11027) purpose is that a `[DataTable]` doesn't require a `ConvertFrom-DataTable` (it automatically unrolls in powershell objects, e.g.: `$DataTable | ForEach-Object { ...`. \r\nA `ConvertTo-DataTable` cmdlet, at the other hand, would be more complex as a `[pscustomobject]` might contain different datatypes in a single column with makes a hard to define a single column `DataType` for a 'DataTable.Column` and it is also hard to determine the `DataType` if you want to support streaming. Besides a `[DataTable]` doesn't support as many data types as a `[PSCustomObject]`. Anyways, I have given it try here: https://powersnippets.com/convertto-datatable/\r\n\r\nBut I think it would be nice if PowerShell better supports the creation of that tables with an easier constructor and adding data rows, see: #11987\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://powersnippets.com/convertto-datatable/\">ConvertTo-DataTable â€“ Power$nippets</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
