First, make sure your copy of the repo is up to date (`git fetch; git status`) -- you may want to make sure you also have the latest commits from upstream if your main remote is a fork (as it often is) -- `git pull upstream master` can do that if you need that (substitute the name of your upstream remote if needed).\r\n\r\nSecond, always try with `Start-PSBuild -Clean` _first_. Do a clean build anytime you pull new commits in from upstream, and/or any other time you find yourself running into issues. After a clean build, you can do regular builds as needed, but a -Clean build is always required first, as it generates some necessary files.\r\n\r\nLet us know how that goes, and we'll see what more needs to happen here. ðŸ™‚ ",
