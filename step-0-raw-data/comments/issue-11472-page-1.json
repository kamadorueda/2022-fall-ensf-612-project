Arrays as keys don't work very well but I'm not aware of any issues with using arrays as values. Can you expand on this?\r\n\r\n@jantari \r\nThere's one huge advantage to returning objects with the host name as a property on the object: it allows streaming. In other words, you get objects from remote machines as soon as they are available. Returning something like a hashtable would stall the whole process until the very last record is received from the very last machine. (But if you do want that, you can use `Group-Object` as the others have mentioned.)\r\n\r\nAlso, remote operations return deserialized objects (PSObject) which are essentially a wrapper around a hashtable so adding the hostname as a property doesn't really add significant overhead.",
