[The documentation for `SendAsyncCancel()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.networkinformation.ping.sendasynccancel?view=netframework-4.8) mentions that `SendAsyncCancel()` is meant to cancel async requests submitted with `SendAsync()` ðŸ¤” \r\n\r\nDownloaded the build artifact, and it seems to cancel, but the task doesn't return until the predefined timeout either way... though it does stop. Weird. So I guess it sort of does, but it won't cause the task to return right away. Odd. I think it was already doing that before this change, though, so it must be something that the API is doing internally, a shared code path somewhere, most likely.",

It may be worth simply skipping the traceroute tests under Unix until we get better functionality from .NET Core if we aren't already.",
