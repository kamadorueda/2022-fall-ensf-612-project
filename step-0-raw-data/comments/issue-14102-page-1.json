It is wrong. It should be `CompatiblePSEditions=@(\"Desktop\")` if the module is known to be Not working in PS Core.\r\nPlease note `Unless the module manifest indicates that module is compatible with PowerShell Core...` in this quote from [About Windows PowerShell compatibility](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_windows_powershell_compatibility?view=powershell-7.1):\r\n```\r\nLONG DESCRIPTION\r\nUnless the module manifest indicates that module is compatible with PowerShell Core,\r\nmodules in the %windir%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules folder\r\nare loaded in a background Windows PowerShell 5.1 process\r\nby Windows PowerShell Compatibility feature.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo at high level the process is:\r\nWhen `-UseWindowsPowerShell` parameter is used - user's intent is perfectly clear, so compatibility solution is used immediately to load the module (regardless of what module manifest says about module compatibility).\r\nWhen `-UseWindowsPowerShell` parameter is Not specified, PS will first check module manifest. If it finds `Core` value in `CompatiblePSEditions` then PS will load the module directly, if the value is not there - it will use compatibility solution to load it.\r\n",
