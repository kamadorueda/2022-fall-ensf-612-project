    "body": "Is this issue still relevant or a workaround such as `$j=\"job7\"; Wait-Job $j -Timeout 5 >$null; Receive-Job $j` is considered good enough?\r\n\r\nI am asking partly because PR #5471 that resolves a related issue was submitted some years ago but was never merged. Therefore it seems that the [suggested workaround](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/5471#pullrequestreview-77138717) in this PR is practically considered good enough.",
