    "body": "@StingyJack the fact that PSCore6 works side-by-side with Windows PowerShell means you can use it.  Certainly enterprise policy may not allow actual deployment of PSCore6, but that's a different problem.\r\n\r\nRemoving any alias from Windows PowerShell is too big a breaking change to even be considered.\r\n\r\nVSC is the premier cross platform IDE.  It still a work in progress and will improve over time.  VS has features that will never show up in VSC.  The PowerShell Team focused on VSC because of it is cross platform and the major feature of PSCore6 is cross platform.  VS support of PowerShell will improve.",
