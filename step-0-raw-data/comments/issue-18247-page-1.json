After our project is built, the scans in our pipeline report these files as malicious since they are not signed.\r\nWe have to account for this scenario as well. Maybe signatures in these files will not be validated when they are being used as it is in non-Windows, but that should be fine as the files would be signed for other consumers, like us.",
