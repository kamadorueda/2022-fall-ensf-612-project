I do think it's certainly worth discussing and investigating further - along with other customization options that have been discussed and how to handle `powershell.config.json`.  \r\n\r\nSo, help me clarify the suggestion. The suggestion is to add `DisabledPreviewExperimentalFeatures` that requires a user to individually list the features that are to be disabled.  If they don't list them, then all experimental features are enabled for this and all previews. Is that correct?\r\n\r\n",

Today, the current-user scope file is always located in `C:\\Users\\<user-name>\\Documents\\PowerShell\\powershell.config.json`. So, maybe for preview versions, the current-user scope file path should be `C:\\Users\\<user-name>\\Documents\\PowerShell\\preview\\powershell.config.json`.\r\n\r\nWith this, the stable and preview versions of pwsh uses different current-user scope config files, and won't be conflicting with each other. For the all-user scope config files, they are always in `$PSHOME` for each pwsh instance, so there is no conflict on it.",
