We're just kinda testing it out in WT right now to make sure this works for all the cases we'd like before documenting it in greater detail. Wouldn't want to have to rewrite the whole docs if we're wrong ðŸ˜… The fix also isn't going to be in OS builds of ConPTY for quite some time yet, so that gives us a bit of wiggle room for making sure the surface is stable.",
