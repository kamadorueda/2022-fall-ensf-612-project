I do think that there should be an easy real time way to capture the output of your PowerShell code and analyze it at an enterprise level.\r\n\r\nI agree with you that compiling my own version of PowerShell is a non-starter.  The distribution is too complex.  Additionally I want my user statistics to go to Microsoft so that our experience is recorded and goes toward making the product better.\r\n\r\nWe have toyed with the concept of creating a centralized logger.  Again, I would not consider this a low barrier approach because the back end infrastructure to analyze the results would need to be created.  It would serve the purpose to create a centralized logging store, but dashboard, analysis, statistics would all need to be developed.  That is where I was hoping Azure App Insights could fill the gap.",
