I.e.\n>    build.psm1 can find dotnet, if it's not in the path, can run dotnet\n>    build or dotnet publish, etc. I think it's better to avoid duplicating\n>    all such logic and use build.sh precisely for the bootstrapping on the\n>    new platforms. If we agree about this purpose, then my suggestion would be\n>    to replace\n>\n> pushd src/powershell-unix\n> dotnet build --configuration Linux\n> popd\n>\n> by\n>\n> dotnet publish --configuration Linux ./src/powershell-unix/ --output bin\n>\n> And add an echo message about the build location, something like You can\n> run powershell from bin/.\n>\n>    1. publish will create a self-contained build of powershell.\n>    2. Putting it in bin/ will allow to avoid complicated logic about\n>    figuring out where the build was made\n>    3. this version could be used for the build with .psm1 and would not\n>    interfere with the standard location (avoid \"file in use\" problem).\n>\n>\n>    - build.sh doesn't perform analog of Restore-PSModule (adding PS\n>    modules from myget and psgallery). It's worth to have a message with this\n>    information at the end of the build to avoid confusion.\n>\n> â€”\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/2832>, or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AB8JvCcph1OdwgySUuL4jaQkQbE6FVSyks5rFGB3gaJpZM4LCEBA>\n> .\n>\n",
