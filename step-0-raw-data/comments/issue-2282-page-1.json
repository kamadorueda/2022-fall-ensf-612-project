    "body": "@hakabo, thanks. I assume the older certificate is still valid. http.sys caches the certificate, so that's the reason the connection is working even when the cert is deleted from store. I expect the SSL endpoint to stop working after the cert has expired or after a machine reboot. \n\nPlease let me know your observations. \n",

My hypothesis is that the cert is correctly updated, and that WinRM does present the correct cert, but that for some reason the WinRM PS drive and netsh commands list outdated information.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1247626/19241228/8e351c3c-8edb-11e6-860e-b4cbaf86db9b.png)\n\nNote the discrepency here, both commands list the first cert ever used with WInRM on this machine, however this info does not match what we see in the MMC.\n",
