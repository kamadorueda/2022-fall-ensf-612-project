    "body": "So... I expect the first question they will ask is \"well how many spaces do YOU think a tab should occupy?\" And the problem is that not everyone will agree. I think it *is* likely that a significant majority of PowerShell users would prefer 4, not 8, but I doubt PowerShell is actually getting involved here, and it's left to the terminal to decide how big a tab is. I don't know if there is a way to configure that on conhost... maybe you could check on microsoft/terminal and let us know.",
