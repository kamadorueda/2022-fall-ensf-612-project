Into functions, into the pipeline, into variables, everywhere!\r\n\r\nWhat `Select-String` does today is it returns objects as well of type `MatchInfo`. But you already knew that üòÅ\r\n\r\nThe addition of a `-Raw` flag in my mind (and @mklement0 who originally opened the issue) is that `-Raw` would tell `Select-String` to actually return `string`s instead of `MatchInfo`s.\r\n\r\nWhat your current implementation does is still returning `MatchInfo` objects but it's changing the behavior of `MatchInfo.ToString()` to look like it's only returning the matching lines.\r\n\r\nIt's still really impressive what you've done so far, but we should look at the problem from a different angle.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Let me know if you're interested in still working on this üòäno rush",

If you feel these features shouldn't have been approved, please voice your concerns there.\r\n\r\nTo recap the rationale:\r\n\r\n* `Select-String`'s core mandate - as the name implies - is to return _strings_. As such, this is what it should always have done _by default_. Lest we break backward compatibility, the best we can do now is offer the typical use case as an _opt-in_.\r\n\r\n  * In hindsight, `Select-String` could have been patterned after `Get-Content`, which outputs strings, as expected, that are  _decorated with NoteProperty members_ to provide metadata. \r\n\r\n  * The `-Raw` switch would still make sense then, however, as an opt-out of the costly act of decoration, as has been proposed for `Get-Content` in #7537.\r\n\r\n  * The case for `-Raw` as a general opt-out-of-decoration-or-wrapping-in-helper-types was made in #7855.\r\n\r\n* `| % Line` is not only more cumbersome, but performs poorly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
