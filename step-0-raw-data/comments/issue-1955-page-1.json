The code is [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/libpsl-native/test/test-getfullyqualifiedname.cpp), and the function it's testing is [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/libpsl-native/src/getfullyqualifiedname.cpp).\n\nThere seems to be much disagreement between `getaddrinfo()->ai_canonname` and `gethostname()`; which, to be fair, is probably to be expected (nodename and canonnname are not necessarily identical).\n\nI think the main problem is [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/libpsl-native/src/getfullyqualifiedname.cpp#L27), where the library first attempts to get the hostname, and if it looks like an FQDN, uses it; otherwise it attempts to get the cannonname. This logic was implemented in 2d442eb73279a24638e63c4a82344de5717e5a70.\n\n@palladia do you remember why this was done? It's causing problems :smile: \n",
