There's a bit more info in #11400. \r\n\r\nReading back through that discussion, sounds like the most promising option would be to duplicate the format view definitions for `System.IO.FileInfo` and `System.IO.DirectoryInfo` and explicitly declare the same formatters for their deserialised versions to account for this.\r\n\r\nI'll mark this as duplicate for now. If you're interested in looking at a fix yourself, I can point out the relevant code areas where the formatting is handled. If not, I might have a look in a while myself; it'd be good to get this fixed for 7.1. ðŸ™‚ ",
