    "body": "It's likely that PowerShell can't load `System.Collections.Immutable.dll` because it already has that assembly loaded. You should see it in `$PSHOME`. Let us know what the output of the following is:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ngci $PSHOME | ? { $_.Name -eq 'System.Collections.Immutable.dll' } | % { [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFile($_.FullName).GetName() }\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou won't be able to load your version and PowerShell's version at the same time, and since PowerShell uses its version very early on, it's always going to win. The best solution is probably to pin your version to the lowest version used by any of the PowerShell versions you want to support.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're putting together a binary module (i.e. using the DLL dependency from C#/.NET rather than from PowerShell script), you probably don't want `RequiredAssemblies` but instead should put your DLL next to the `RootModule` and let PowerShell's assembly resolve event handler do the dependency resolution for you.\r\n\r\nFinally, since in this case the DLL is present in PowerShell, you probably don't want to include it in your module at all. When you build your module, try just omitting it.\r\n\r\nI'm actually about to publish a blog post relevant to this.\r\n\r\nA few extra points:\r\n\r\n- PS 6.2.4 is out of support; you should upgrade to either 6.2.5 or preferably 7.0.1\r\n- PSStandard is now available with version 5.1.1 too\r\n- If you can provide the full stack trace of the error, it will be much easier to determine specifically what's going on. In PS 6 you'll need to do `$error[0] | fl * -force`, in PS 7 it's as simple as `Get-Error`.",
