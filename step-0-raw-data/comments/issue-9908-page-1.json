I find debugging a manifest to be pretty useless because it's not really code (there really isn't much to see/do here).\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a bunch more variables and some additional commands to the manifest, but in my mind it's still not enough to warrant debugging.\r\n\r\nI think that this approach (that a manifest is not cannot be debugged) is a good measure for whether or not additional commands should be added to the manifest. The more we add, the more we open the opportunity for wanting to debug it, but it shouldn't be \"code\" per se...it should just be module metadata specified in a PowerShell-ish way.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I would avoid adding support for any commands other than those that we deem absolutely necessary in a manifest.",

If a cmdlet compiled but can not be used on a platform (or we don't want to expose it), for the case (it is true for script cmdlet too) we could use an attribute (new parameter in existing attributes) to inform engine to load the cmdlet/function/alias only on platform specified in the attribute.

My original thinking was if that was implemented to be additive, such that the platform-specific properties are combined with the platform-agnostic properties in the manifest, I'd like it much better than having conditional logic here and there. It would also make it easier to view as a property file, which is its intent, and it would be easier to author correctly as well since it would be more about defining properties and less about conditional logic.\r\n\r\nThere is a problem though. What do you do for metadata that you want to define for multiple platforms, but not all platforms? Do you define it once for each platform, resulting in duplication? That's not great. So how could we specify properties for multiple platforms this way? That's where conditional logic comes in handy, because then I can do this (contrived, assumes that we get support for `Out-Printer` on macos but not on Linux):\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n# ...\r\nCmdletsToExport = @(\r\n    'Out-String'\r\n    'Out-File'\r\n    'Out-Host'\r\n    'Out-Null'\r\n    if ($IsWindows -or $IsMacOS) {'Out-Printer'}\r\n)\r\n# ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince we already support conditional logic in manifest, I think this is probably the easiest path forward to success.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think we need to be minimalistic and only add the bare minimum variables that we know would be useful, i.e. `$IsWindows`, `$IsLinux`, and `$IsMacOS`. Others can be added in separate PRs if there is a driving need for them.\r\n\r\nI would also drop `$PSHome` from this PR, because module authors shouldn't be doing anything directly with that path, and if they do have that need, that may point to issues that should be addressed in a different manner.",

That will be a lengthy change and something that's not coming in PSGet 3.0... So in the meantime, I'm in favor of allowing `$Is*` because of the utility and easy of use.",
