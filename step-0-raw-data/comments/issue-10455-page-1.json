    "body": "@adityapatwardhan \r\nI am not too surprised at this, as this change increases the processing rate of creating/running scripts.  Even though the default Throttle limit is 5, since the script block is empty the code is basically creating and disposing threads/runspaces as fast as it can, 10000 times.  So I am not surprised that memory consumption is large.\r\n\r\nAs long as the CLR eventually collects the memory, I think we are Ok.\r\n\r\nI have run tests that loop for hours, detecting handle and working set usage.  So far I see the usage plateau after a while so there seems to be no resource leak.  However, the CLR and GC is getting a lot of exercise!",
