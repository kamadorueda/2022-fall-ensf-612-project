Some of these need to passed along _without_ being resolved at all, not as a file name/directory name or anything. With PSNativePSPathResolution a standard feature, if PS thinks it's a relative path it's _resolving_ it to what it thinks the full path \"should\" be. Which means an argument like this will never be passed to the executable verbatim. Which is going to be endlessly problematic.\r\n\r\nIf we get `name1:name2` and `name1` isn't a recognised physical drive or PSDrive, IMO it should be passed along verbatim.",
