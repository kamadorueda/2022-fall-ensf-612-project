    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT \r\n\r\nSorry, I did not mean to imply that the problem was your doing or something you created and I\r\ncertainly do appreciate all you have done since joining the team!\r\n\r\nMy issue is with the answers provided regarding the problem.\r\n\r\nI have been in the field for 32 years and have programmed in at least 25 different programming\r\nlanguages during my career.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, there is one common theme and answer to the question, \"Why do we write programs?\"\r\n\r\nWe program so that we can automate processes and produce reliable, consistent, and repeatable results.\r\n\r\nThere are very few cases or reasons why we would want to write code which produced results which were not repeatable or consistent (random number generator comes to mind) as that would defeat the purpose of automating the tasks.\r\n\r\nIf we were discussing what the expected behavior was versus what the actual behavior was that\r\nis something that could be addressed (but maybe not desired) by changing your/my expectations\r\nto match the actual behavior.\r\n\r\nThat is NOT the case here.  The same code run multiple times does not produce the same results.\r\n\r\nBefore taking the time to write up that bug and all the various situations, I spent CONSIDERABLE\r\ntime trying various syntax (trailing slashes, *, *.*, and others) to try and find a single syntax\r\nthat would produce a consistent result which could be used in code which would cover the use cases.\r\n\r\nAny good developer is not going to write new code using existing code which does not produce repeatable results because then their code also becomes unreliable and unstable.\r\n\r\nI'll bet that most PS developers have taken the route that I have which is to use external tools to\r\nperform that functionality in their code so that they can get consistent repeatable results.\r\n\r\nI take breaking code issues quite seriously too, however, when the original code is broke in the first\r\nplace, it makes sense to fix it regardless of whether it would break \"other\" code.\r\n\r\nYou can argue as to whether you want to label this as a bug or whether it was a design flaw, however, that does not change the fact that the existing code does NOT produce consistent results.\r\n\r\nImagine if the existing Copy-Item had a bug where it deleted the file after it copied it.  Using the\r\nanswer you provided, that would not be addressed because it might break existing code that depended on that bug.  I cannot imagine anyone considering that a good reason or answer.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I wrote all that up and reviewed it, however, there were also examples where\r\ndata loss occurs because there was no warning or confirmation.   That certainly goes against the\r\nbasic PS design principles of not doing harm without a warning.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate that you opened the issue for FileSystemProvider V2, I am quite skeptical that it will ever occur based on your response here, your comment about \"if #5785 ever gets done\", and the fact that these issues have gone unaddressed pretty much since the beginning of PS.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether the existing code is fixed or whether a V2 is created, there should still\r\nbe a desired to provide this basic functionality in the product, especially one that is marketed\r\nas the replacement for all of the other command shells.\r\n\r\nI really hope that someone take up the task of addressing this most basic and core functionality.\r\n\r\nSincerely,\r\n\r\nJoe\r\n",

    "body": "Again - getting angry is pointless. Now that PowerShell is open source, you can see what the team is doing and what its priorities are. The bug you refer to is one I have never seen in practice - but I've only been using PowerShell for just short of 20 years. I can tell you, there are some tough tradeoffs that have to be made, but you can see the process (unlike in other WIndows components that are totally opaque in terms of the changer (The feedback hub is just a black hole).\r\n\r\nThe challenge here is that if the team 'fixes' this problem, it is likely to be a complex change (eg File System Provider (V2)) and would not be cheap, It also would almost certainly be a breaking change that could (would?) break a LOT of existing scripts that depend on the current behavior.  A targeted fix for just the original issue could be considered but this too has the potential to break stuff. And for me breaking stuff, without a really good reason, is just not acceptable.  Frankly, I would prefer to leave this as it is, with well-documented workarounds, than to try to fix it.  I do get that mileage may vary on this!\r\n\r\nLike so many issues here in the repo, this is one I suspect we may just close as \"won't fix - by design\" which is what I am thinking today.  But can you convince the team that this is a bug that NEEDS fixing? Is there enough user demand for this change? Right now, I am not seeing the need to make this change today. But please convince me I am not looking in the right places.\r\n",

This practically blocks changes of internal APIs if we strictly intend to avoid breaking changes.\r\nAs for cmdlets, I tried to strictly state PowerShell concepts in the RFC and found inconsistencies and deviations in the implementations. If we intend to conform strictly to PowerShell concepts and path manipulation rules, it will inevitably lead to a lot of breaking changes.\r\nAmong other things, there are performance problems which should have been solved if we are going to do anything in this area (i.e. path/file operations). This also requires changes on all four levels.\r\nWe could of course isolate the new code as an experimental feature starting with the cmdlet level, but as you understand we would have to re-design and write all four levels of code from scratch and this would inevitably affect all providers. So initially we should have written several thousand new tests for all providers and their cmdlets to avoid regressions. At the very least we need these new tests to open the door to innovation.\r\n\r\n",

It was so popular that it was itself a standard, while violating all public standards. When its popularity declined, it became a serious problem. MSFT was forced to release 5 (!) versions of IE each introducing a new compatibility mode. This made IE so complicated that MSFT threw it out and said it would use Chrome!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of pwsh, there are about 50 breaking changes tagged in 2 1/2 years, plus probably as many more in the previous 2 1/2 years before 2016, plus things that were deliberately cut out (like workflow, etc.). As a result, we see a huge number of incompatibilities with Windows PowerShell. \r\nWe accept this as inevitable.\r\nThe policy today is that all innovation is in pwsh only, Windows PowerShell is frozen.\r\nMaybe it's time to take a new leap and say pwsh 7 is frozen, the last LTS will be 7.4 and all innovations will be in pwsh 8.\r\nThese innovations could modernize virtually all pwsh subsystems.\r\nOf course, that would require a lot of effort. But I don't see how we could make it easier and cheaper within version 7. It's more of a dead-end way to transform IE6.\r\n",

I remember when I first started using PS before I wrote up my 12 use case bug report where I figured I must be doing something wrong until I did some research and found many people searching for how to get it working.\r\n\r\nI hope that your suggestion sticks and that PS 8 is all about making sure the basics work and addressing any areas where performance is not as good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
