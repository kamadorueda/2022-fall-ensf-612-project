Therefore you can use the command \"curl\" to invoke all the features and functions of `libcurl`. (Not only downloads!)\n\nThe same things apply to `FFmpeg` and `libavformat/libavcodec`. The former is the CLI of the latter library.\n\nWindows PowerShell will never `alias FFmpeg=\"Windows Media Player\"`.

    "body": "@jpsnover \n\nFirstly, thank you for your contribution in this thread, you're handling this quite well. \n\nIt seems like it should be fairly trivial to fix this in a fairly consistent manner.\n\nPS > get-command ls -All\n\n```\nCommandType     Name                                               ModuleName\n-----------     ----                                               ----------\nAlias           ls -> Get-ChildItem\nApplication     ls.exe\n```\n\nSo Powershell already has a means of identifying if there are multiple commands/functions/aliases of the same name present on the system.\n\nI should think one possible solution would be that in the begin block of a Commandlet where a commonly used alias has been provided, that the system run a check using get-command to see if another variation of that command is present.  \n\nAs another possibility or extension, you could add a ParameterSet for the commands that includes the native parameters for the original application. Curl being a rather decent example, there really isn't a lot of collisions between the actual Curl command, and the PS Invoke-WebRequest, even including command aliases.  \n\n```\n    PS > (get-command invoke-webrequest).Parameters.Keys | % {\n    >>  [PSCustomObject] @{\n    >>     Name = $_\n    >>     Aliases = (get-command invoke-webrequest).Parameters[$_].Aliases\n    >>  }\n    >> }\n    >>\n\n    Name                                                                       Aliases\n    ----                                                                       -------\n    UseBasicParsing                                                            {}\n    Uri                                                                        {}\n    WebSession                                                                 {}\n    SessionVariable                                                            {SV}\n    Credential                                                                 {}\n    UseDefaultCredentials                                                      {}\n    CertificateThumbprint                                                      {}\n    Certificate                                                                {}\n    UserAgent                                                                  {}\n    DisableKeepAlive                                                           {}\n    TimeoutSec                                                                 {}\n    Headers                                                                    {}\n    MaximumRedirection                                                         {}\n    Method                                                                     {}\n    Proxy                                                                      {}\n    ProxyCredential                                                            {}\n    ProxyUseDefaultCredentials                                                 {}\n    Body                                                                       {}\n    ContentType                                                                {}\n    TransferEncoding                                                           {}\n    InFile                                                                     {}\n    OutFile                                                                    {}\n    PassThru                                                                   {}\n    Verbose                                                                    {vb}\n    Debug                                                                      {db}\n    ErrorAction                                                                {ea}\n    WarningAction                                                              {wa}\n    ErrorVariable                                                              {ev}\n    WarningVariable                                                            {wv}\n    OutVariable                                                                {ov}\n    OutBuffer                                                                  {ob}\n    PipelineVariable                                                           {pv}\n\n```\n\nIt seems you could add a parameterset that includes all of the Curl parameters, and since those parameters are currently not even valid for the command, you could simply check $PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName to see if they are passing parameters for the real command, then run the Get-Command -all to resolve it.  \n",

    "body": "Lots of people around here are promoting ideas of /actually/ breaking backward compatibility, for the sake of /theoretically/ improving cross-platform compatibility.\n\nHow about no.  \n\nPowershell was /never/ designed to behave like a Bourne shell derivative with a GNU toolset underneath, and anyone who expects it to start behaving like one 10 years on is being unrealistic.  Aliases preempt disk files.  That's the design.\n\nIt isn't just curl and wget, either.  There's also diff, start, kill, ps, cat, tee, and some others.  These Powershell cmdlets all offer similar functionality to Unixy commands of the same name, but the inputs and outputs are completely different.  Command names are a starting point for humans to understand what a function does, not an iron-clad contract with perfect fidelity across all platforms.\n\nIf at some point in the future, Microsoft were to release an update to Server 2016 that disables Powershell aliases by default, I'm going to have hundreds of broken servers to contend with.  Microsoft's long-standing averseness to changing the behaviour of existing commands and APIs is exactly why so much software written 10, 20, 30 years ago continues to work in Windows 10.  It's also why Powershell hasn't replaced cmd.exe.  People depend on this ongoing commitment to backwards compatibility for business continuance.  For all we know, removing aliases could cause random pieces of Exchange Server or some other critical business software to stop running or quietly behave incorrectly!\n\nAnd yet there are people here who are demanding that I accept that risk **because they want to type 'curl' instead of 'curl.exe'**?  Madness.  Madness.\n\nWith that said, I believe adding a \"-NoAliases\" parameter to powershell.exe would be a good way to provide an alias-free environment for those who do not like this feature of Powershell.\n",

    "body": "@warrenrumak there is no `curl.exe` on Linux.  It is just `curl` which makes it a bit tougher to get to the native executable.  BTW PowerShell Core is already a massive breaking change.  Many of the commands that exist in PowerShell today are not in PowerShell Core because either A) the underlying .NET Core doesn't support them or B) the alternative platforms don't support them. \n\nFrankly, I think PowerShell Core is an opportunity to fix a number of PowerShell issues - one of which is the removal of \"transition\" aliases defined by default e.g. remove curl, wget but leave in iwr, irm.  For the PowerShell faithful - the team could always provide a way to easily re-enable these aliases via profile tricks.  And we (the community and tools like PowerShell Script Analyzer) have been telling you - do NOT use aliases in your scripts!  Aliases are an interactive use tool to help folks be more productive at the CLI and reduce RSI issues.\n\nMany folks on Windows, who have large sets of scripts that need to not break, can continue to run the PowerShell \"desktop\" edition.  That edition should strive to remain backwards compatible. \n\nThis does leave us with a diverging desktop vs core edition issue.  I don't think the changes discussed here (removal of some built-in aliases) are any more insurmountable then the inherent breaking changes between desktop and core.  If you're a PowerShell scripter who wants to write scripts that can target desktop _and_ core, you have a bit more work to do.  And hopefully, tools will be able to help spot issues.\n",

There are a few reasons for this, but most importantly is that this would inherently lead to less-portable scripting practices.\n\nAs of right now if you choose to use wget.exe or curl.exe on a Windows system, you're forced to use explicitly call those.  If I'm allowed to turn off Unix aliases in my profile, and then write my scripts with the assumption that it will be run on a system with a similar setup, that would lead to less-explicit coding, and when I publish my code to github for sharing, someone can download a copy and run into errors, because unless they read the README, they won't realize that they need to also turn off Unix aliases.\n\nWe would then have to rely on the developer to ensure that the Remove-All-Unix-Aliases function is called in the top of the script (and ensure it only works for the duration of the script) where we intend to have those aliases replaced.  And if that is the preference on how to do this, using Remove-Alias explicitly for the commands you intend to use at the top of the script is IMHO a better solution than a blanket script to remove everything to begin with.\n\nRemove-Item Alias:Curl\nRemove-Item Alias:WGet\n\nInsert that at the top of my script, and we've worked around the issue as elegantly as we can, aside from explicitly calling the command with the .exe extension.\n\nEither way you look at it, I agree with anyone saying that we should be using best practices in scripts, such that removing an alias like wget or curl would not be a breaking-change, but just a learning curve for those who are actually at the command line.  That's obviously not the case, so the best solution is to modify the search order when a learning curve alias is being utilized to evaluate it more closely. \n",

This issue is symptomatic of a larger concern about being able to make improvements to PowerShell without breaking backward compatibility _in general_, not just limited to aliases or per-platform issues.\n\nI'd suggest that a script should be able to declare for which version of PowerShell it was intended.  That a `Use-Version 4` command or metadata declaration at the top of a script would opt you into a runtime environment tailored for that version, and that runtime environment then need not necessarily be backward compatible; and that this could impact more than just aliases but even extending to parsing changes or other behavioral changes, similar to how Perl's `use v5.10;` statement is used to opt into possibly breaking features.\n",

Something like: `Import-Module Future.RemoveAliases.Net.Http` where **`Future`** contains exported module members (sub-modules, I'll call them) for opting in to _future_ breaking changes **_now**_, **`RemoveAliases`** includes sub-modules for removing various sets of previously defined \"helper\" aliases, **`Net`** includes sub-modules for removing network-related aliases, and **`Http`** removes the `curl` and `wget`aliases.\n\nThat's my $0.02, anyway. That would let you combine the best of all worlds. @jpsnover's current favorite idea would just get a different syntax, and we could add `Import-Module Future.RemoveAliases` to a profile to remove all aliases, others can use `Import-Module Future.RemoveAliases.Net.Http` to remove the `curl` and `wget` aliases, and _you_ could add `Import-Module Future` into yours, and live life always on the bleeding edge! 😀\n",

That's obviously not the case, so the best solution is to modify the search order when a learning curve alias is being utilized to evaluate it more closely.\n\nAs you can see, I agree :)\n\nI was just saying that people are obviously using aliases, and that will never change for everyone across the board (hence why this becomes a breaking change).  I have just recently ran my first script through PSScriptAnalyzer (800 lines of code) and removed all errors/warnings.  Honestly, just doing this once is a learning experience everyone should do, even if they don't intend to use it in all their scripts.  You learn a lot.  But personally, I'm doing my best to start running all of my scripts through PSScriptAnalyzer, and use best practices as often as possible.\n",

    "body": "All, I'll have to side with @omrsafetyo on this one.  Simply improving Windows Powershell's curl and wget built-ins should provide an immediate improvement for most users.\n\nEven Busybox has a terrible wget implementation; intersecting Busybox wget with GNU wget gets us these:\n- --spider\n- -c, --continue\n- -q, --quiet\n- -P\n- -O\n- -U, --user-agent\n\nNote that wget and busybox disagree on other options (-s for spider, --output-document or --output-file for -O).\n\nMight I suggest the following changes to the wget alias, perhaps adding it as an extension of Invoke-WebRequest rather than an alias:\n- -O accepted as a synonym for -OutFile\n- -U and --user-agent accepted as a synonym for -UserAgent\n- -c and --continue implemented as in wget\n- -q, --quiet for quiet operation\n\nThis would retain 100% compatibility with wget as an alias for Invoke-WebRequest, and immediately implement the above four options to extend PowerShell wget into something resembling the most-common options used in GNU Wget.  It would at least be no more of an offense than Busybox, least of all if you somehow added --spider (-s) later.\n\nWhen invoked as curl, you could attempt a similar strategy.\n\nThis change _will not break things_, and will give an immediate improvement in compatibility.  In the future, Microsoft may declare that these commands will wrap Invoke-WebRequest with a compatibility profile to implement the wget and curl interfaces, and that they are deprecated as an Invoke-WebRequest alias; if not, then these changes still allow writing for a common intersection.\n\nIn a more slightly-off-topic direction...\n\n@bagder I know you're not trying to be rude, and your behavior is more familiar and frank than all that; I'd like to point out that @joeyaiello and @jpsnover had a better opening, by simple virtue of being calm and, mostly, just by framing from a sympathetic point-of-view (this is a common and well-documented technique).\n\nNo doubt it's more fun to read level-headed, polite, but frank discussions than it is to read the sterile, diplomatic mumbo-jumbo that represents universally-effective technique.  As much as this pleases me, I feel you'd be served well by Dale Carnegie's famous book, _How to Win Friends and Influence People_; the audiobook is even a fantastic performance (ignore the \"In the Digital Age\" version), and the material is well-presented and highly effective.  It appears to me you're interested in keeping things civil, and so I thought I'd share.\n",

(Since it doesn't entirely disable support for aliases, only disables some of the default ones?) Maybe something like -NoDefaultAliases or -NoCompatibilityAliases?\n\nFurthermore, could PowerShell follow the git approach when there are breaking changes, and provide deprecation/configuration warnings on interactive terminals? Like when the behavior for git add changed for removed files, we got a warning asking you to configure your environment, and telling the default behavior would change in a future release.\n\nOverall kudos to Microsoft for OpenSourcing and porting this over, and providing a good path to integration/compatibility on *NIX environments moving forward\n\n## \n\nYou are receiving this because you commented.\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHubhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/1901#issuecomment-241148341, or mute the threadhttps://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ARh-S45zUSRtHLrUo5VDYL34FTDSXSUvks5qhiozgaJpZM4Jn1fs.\n",

And I think the best candidate is to extend the \"drive\" mechanism already built in to Powershell. We already have a drive named `Alias:`. Adding a `Path:` drive would allow us to say `Alias:curl` to mean the internal version and `Path:curl` to mean an executable named `curl` found on the system `$Env:Path`.\n",

    "body": "@antony _Every_ part of the environment introduces mutable state into every script. Starting from slightly incompatible implementations of default commands in Unix shell scripts (e.g. GNU vs. BSD), environment variables, current directory, etc.\n\nWhat would your course of action be here? Don't observe aliases in scripts, okay. But continuing from there?\n- Do the same for modules? Because in the past Pscx introduced an own, incompatible version of `Get-Random` which took precedence. You can work around that by fully-qualifying every single cmdlet you use, but that's quite a step further than just replacing aliases with their actual cmdlets.\n- Do the same for functions? Well, bummer, mkdir is no longer available, you have to use `New-Item -ItemType Directory` in that case. Or something as benign as `C:` in Windows PowerShell.\n- Don't observe `$Env:Path`. Because native commands could be different depending on which one is called depending on search order in `$Env:Path`.\n\nAll those things introduce failure points into a script based on the outside environment. At some point you have to concede and allow some of them because otherwise scripts would be utterly unusable.\n\n(Also I'd hate to no longer being able to do code golf in PowerShell. But that's a rather minor issue.)\n",

    "body": "I find this attitude not really conductive of anything. Yeah, Microsoft tried to outcompete Linux and mantain its dominance. That worked for some time and then the market and developer mindset shifted. It became clear that Open Source is a positive sum game, and developers were favoring open tools over proprietary ones. So Microsoft shifted its strategy accordingly. Corporations (like any large group) are not individuals and cannot be analyzed like that: leaderships change, the entire workforce changes and there are always dissenting voices and ideas.\n\nWhat does it even mean to \"usurp\" Linux? The MIT/BSD license gives us the ultimate control over what goes in our systems, if in the future Microsoft decided to make decisions that would not be beneficial to the ecosystem we could just fork the repo, and move on. \n\nFurthermore how is this issue even related to Linux directly? It could be argued that the original addition of the aliases was bad, but I genuinely can't see it as an \"embrace, extend, extinguish\" thing. I think they only wanted to provide convenience and familiarity to devs making the switch from *NIX environments.\n\nPowerShell has some great ideas on it, has received countless man hours of work and polish, and Microsoft is giving us all of that for free both as in beer and as in speech. Not being this hostile is the least we can do.\n",

But in some cases they simply makes sense.\nIn some cases it's easy to switch between a old and new behavior.\n\nGit is a great example. Well ahead of the next major release a warning is produced when using a given feature, informing the user that the default behavior of the given command will change in the next release and instructions how to stick to the old behavior or enable the new behavior immediately.\nSure, Git is open source and released \"as is\" and does not provide support like Microsoft does.\n\nBut there are reasonable limits for how long backward compability can be enforced.\nLessons should be learned to not repeat things like [why ASP.NET in 2016 has restricted filenames because of decisions made in the 1970s.](https://bitquabit.com/post/zombie-operating-systems-and-aspnet-mvc/).\n",

Should PS remove things like `ls` in particular?\n\nI don't have an answer to this one, but for removing curl and wget, I think the best way is to have another machine-wide install, like \"PowerShell Legacy Tools Compatibility Support\" (would ideally be better named maybe), which includes these tools back.by including them in default profile etc.\n\nThis way those who want to upgrade can have the 2 installs and their usual PowerShell. Eventually those tools can go through a deprecation cycle and then complete removal (or availability as 3rd party modules with manual install script). That could take years.\n\nOf course this adds a lot more work on the team, which may or may not be acceptable for the outcome, and there are definitely competing priorities as well, but it's a mere suggestion.\n\nThanks for opening the PowerShell source and support more OSes.\n",

They basically defined the modern OS - I think if anyone knows how to run an open source project, it's them.\"\n\nThis comment demonstrates a lack of awareness about both the history of Computer Science:Operating  system development  and Open Source culture. \n\nMS products were known for decades as being the worst on the market.  They had only two marketable features: They were blessed as a standard by IBM and they were cheap.  This led to widespread adoption by businesses that were otherwise intimidated by technology. \n\nBill Gates openly claimed that both he and Steve Job's stole all their ideas for their respective GUI systems from Xerox.  \n\nGate's original DOS was purchased/licensed from another small company and he re-licensed it to IBM (in a very shrewd and lucrative deal. :-)  )  \n\nMS' \"NT\" OS was substantially (but not completely), a clone/re-write of VMS done by actual VMS engineers with the Windows GUI added on top.\n\nThe only things MS defined about modern OS was the race to the bottom for software quality,  how to steal intellectual property from other companies and how to violate anti-trust laws so grossly that the Federal government actually had to prosecute them for it. \n\nMicrosoft neither invented nor defined anything new about operating systems.   You have mistaken one business winning the race to the bottom for engineering prowess. \n\nPeople who actually know what they are talking about know that MS created almost nothing substantive except how to market insecure, buggy software. (They are excellent at copying and selling )\n\nIt is no wonder then why a free version of UNIX has almost completely replaced them in every new market and is slowly pushing them out of the markets they currently populate.   \n\nAccording to Gartner, the following is the worldwide device shipments (referring to wholesale) by operating system, which includes smartphones, tablets, laptops and PCs together.\n\n```\nAndroid     1.3 Billion  (54%)\nOthers      520 million  (21.6% ) \niOS         297 Mill(12.3%)\nWindows     283 Million  (11.7%)    \nOS X       21 million\n```\n\n(New markets - cell computing, dominated by the Android-Linux: 80-85%, IOS:10-15% \n\nTablets:   Andoid-Linux 68%, I-Pad 28%\n\nTop 500 Super computers: June 2016 - Linux; 497 out of 500,\n\n Cloud services - virtually all based on Linux , except, of course, the misbegotten MS cloud service which is failing in the market.\n\nGoogle, Amazon, Facebook, New York Stock Exchange, American Stock exchange, Yahoo, Most Fortune 500 Companies - all using Linux servers, some exclusively.\n\nRegarding MS and open source;     For the past 25 years MS has worked as hard as it can to oppose Open Standards and has actively denounced and disparaged Open Source.  And you think they are best suited to lead an Open Source Project?\n\nIts clear from the moribund orientation of the \"RFC\" process that MS has absolutely no idea at all how to do Open Source. \n\nWorse, the fact that they don't understand how to resolve a trivial namespace collision (fix it in the smaller scope) means they aren't that up on interoperability engineering.  Sadly, that is a a fatal flaw in Open Source. \n",

    "body": "@JohnMHarrisJr The driving factor of free software is not \"what is best for the end user\"; that is a romantic view.  The driving factor of free software is \"what is best for the developers.\"\n\nOpen source software developers do not study and compare the state-of-the-art processes with the software they write ostensibly to provide that state-of-the-art; they do not engage in focus groups; they do not do requirements analysis.  They write what seems like a good idea in their little world, picking out some of the things users say (often from feature requests) and molding them to fit what they think would be nice.\n\nThis is, in most cases, not an issue because most user interfaces are standard (based on mimicry) and most software provides standard features.  Wars between desktop environments might have some merit, because you can approach them scientifically; and even they are mostly preferential and artistic.\n\nThe things that most stand out are things like project management software, which you _can_ back up with empirical evidence, and which consistently shows a complete lack of understanding of how modern processes dramatically improve the effectiveness of planning and executing large projects; however, that's only my view, and I've seen chemists and EEs freak out about some jibber-jabber about open-source chemistry and EE programs not providing a useful interface for nuclear bonding or complex field tunneling operations or whatever it is they do--this is possibly because I understand PM, they understand Chem and EE, and the open source developers have faulty understanding of these things and so implement broken ideas.\n\nIn the end, it's not about open source or commercial software; it's about your programming team and its management style.  If your team has become governed by a proper management philosophy--whether it's self-governed as in open source or dictated as in business--it will provide better products.  If your team has no idea how to manage itself, it will just produce something impressive to non-professionals, and continuously fail to understand how completely riddled with idiotic design decisions the product truly is.\n\nGriping about a fantasy view of open source vs proprietary is unuseful.\n",

This is bad for the user, who then must either select an inferior GTK+ application over a Qt application; ditch all GTK+ applications for inferior Qt counterparts; or install both toolkits and use hundreds of additional megabytes of space and extra RAM, as well as deal with applications with completely-different look-and-feel, creating the most horrible user experience imaginable.\n\nThe GPL didn't force the developers to make the software the best software for me, the user.

Having system-wide /etc settings on some of these settings allows individual distros and flavours choose how they configure PS (just like is it /bin/{bash,grep} or /usr/bin/{bash,grep}).\n\nFWIW loving PowerShell on Debian sid.\n",

    "body": "@bluefoxicy I think that you misunderstand the idea of the free software movement. The point is that the user has the right to change software installed on their machine to do whatever they want. If you want to go through the trouble of porting KDE to GTK+3, you're more than welcome to. The issue with Qt vs GTK+3 is a personal opinion issue that we don't have a solution for and is not relevant in any way to this thread.\n\nThat aside, many software projects use Qt and many use GTK+3, to the point that you always end up having both installed anyway. This is true on Windows as well, with common applications like HexChat using GTK and many things using Qt.\n",

    "body": "@kuldeepdhaka Your argument is essentially that the Linux Kernel was specially-designed to be the best kernel for everyone.\n\nIf that's true, then Windows is even better, because it was select-taylored to the needs of thousands of times the users.\n\nThe truth is people use open source software because it's cheap (free) and it works for them.  That's incidental.  It's like picking up a rock, smashing something open with it, and declaring God formed that rock especially for you, to fit perfectly in your hand, to smash open the thing you needed opened.\n\nYou insult the user.  You insult the user because the situation you describe is that users are by-and-large too stupid to make use of tools to fit their need; instead, these stupid invalids must have said tools carefully-crafted to meet their needs, else they wouldn't be able to use those tools at all.  That is your claim when you claim that a tool is used by people because it was designed to _best_ suit their needs, rather than because it was **designed to fit the whims of the developer, and incidentally can be made to produce a viable--perhaps not optimal--result for the user**.\n\n@JohnMHarrisJr Why don't you port KDE to GTK+ for me?  It's trivial, right?  If I could do it myself, I'm sure you could go ahead and get that out of the way for me instead.  It'd be easy, right?\n\nWhile we're at it, any user has the ability to make their own smartphone by smelting silicon, iron, and oil into semiconductors and plastics.  Good thing we can all alter our own electronics.\n",
