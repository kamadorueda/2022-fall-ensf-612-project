Perhaps others can comment.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I find the absence of an exponentiation operator from C# puzzling; [this blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/csharpfaq/2004/03/07/why-doesnt-c-have-a-power-operator/) from 2004 explains that it wasn't included because it is \"fairly rare\", which wasn't too well-received in the comments.\r\n\r\nAside from that, PowerShell already has operators that C# doesn't have, and it is a sufficiently different beast so that I wouldn't rule it out just based on that.\r\n\r\nPerhaps PowerShell can lead by example and down the road we'll see an operator added to C# as well? :)\r\n\r\n> An operator is potentially confusing - different languages use different tokens (is it ** or ^)\r\n\r\n`^` indeed invites confusion, because it has [different semantics in some languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponentiation#In_programming_languages).\r\n\r\n`**`, by contrast, while not used by all languages, seems to have no other meaning, and, as stated, is used in several popular languages: Python, Ruby, JavaScript, Perl\r\n\r\n> `[Math]::Pow(2, 8)` is really readable.\r\n\r\nIt is readable, but neither easy to _remember_ nor to _type_.\r\n\r\nTo me, a dedicated exponentiation operator seems like a natural complement to the arithmetic operators.",
