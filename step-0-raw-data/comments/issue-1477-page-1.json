I don't like `Shared-Core` and `Shared-Win` together, because they use different entities at the same places and it's confusing.\nI realize that current way is confusing too, but for long term, we have a better plan (with `$IsLinux`, `$IsCoreCLR` in the .psd1 files).\n\nSo I would probably keep these two things as is. Thank you for the thoughtful feedback!\n",
