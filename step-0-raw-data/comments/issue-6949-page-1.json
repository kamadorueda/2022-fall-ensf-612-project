    "body": "If you remember a year ago, I offered to fix style in tests. Response team was negative - it is better to spend your time on more useful things. It was a convincing position. Then we continued to receive many-many comments on the style of tests _each_ PR. Finally everyone ran out of patience and we fixed our tests.\r\nWe have long endured trailing spaces in our code. At one point, our patience ran out and we fixed it.\r\nNow we understand that spend a lot of useless efforts to style and formatting. So @TravisEz13  suggested the use of CodeFactor.\r\nWe must configure it before we can effectively use it. This is being discussed in #6930.\r\nWe disable obvious rules which we'll never fix like \"one type per file\" or \"ordering elements\" and more. \r\n_The remaining problems, we have to be correct (partially) to use CodeFactor effectively._\r\nShould we disable current issue? I believe no because we already discussed this and we already require that use the _C# style_ in our code. If we leave bad samples we lose meaning use CodeFactor which reports problems a entire file rather than the latest changes.\r\nAbout risk see my https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6930#issuecomment-393015925",

Such a PR should be reviewable, and that's why we proposed the flexible guideline. But this should be temporary -- once the existing style issues reported by CodeFactor are fixed, we won't accept PR with pure style changes.",
