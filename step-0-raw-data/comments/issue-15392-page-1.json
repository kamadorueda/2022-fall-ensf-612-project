I've not taken a close look to see what the real impact would be if those properties were removed, but it's possible that it may be of a little more concern than simply removing non-functioning parameters from the affected command.\r\n\r\nI would generally agree that this suggested change is a good idea, though. I suspect the likelihood of breaking something else is fairly minimal, but it might be worth taking a closer look before making a final decision. 🙂 ",
