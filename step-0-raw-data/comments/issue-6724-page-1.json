    "body": "@iSazonov Yes, it could be in PowerShell engine via something like `-IsolatedContext`. Here are a list of the touch points I can think of throughout the PowerShell universe that should be considered:\r\n\r\n1. psd1 PowerShell Module Manifest file \"knobs\"\r\n    1. `RootModule` key can be a dll (although this fact is not documented _anywhere_, my testing discovered it), that dll in turn can load other dll(s) using the default assembly loading context. While it's possible for the author of the `RootModule` dll to use something like `DotNetCorePlugins` and achieve an isolated context for its dependencies, \r\n    2. (Curiously) If `RootModule` is unspecified and `NestedModules` contains a single dll, that dll will become the entry point for the PowerShell module.  (This was tested using `RedGate.SqlClone.PowerShell` module).  This is my _observed behavior_ and may not be the fundamental behavior.\r\n    3. If `RequiredAssemblies` key is specified, my _observed behavior_ (because PowerShell documentation is missing) is that `Import-Module` for the module forces the assemblies to load before `Import-Module` completes.* (* Asterisk denotes \"before\", because, as you may know, the module cache is asynchronous, so the behavior is actually undefined as to when it really gets loaded.)\r\n        - In PowerShell 5, if you try to load two different dll versions of the same assembly via `RequiredAssemblies`, the second assembly silently fails.  In PowerShell Core, it produces a _warning_, which is better but still not great.\r\n2. `Add-Type` knob\r\n    1. Like the psd1 PowerShell Module Manifest, it contains a `-ReferencedAssemblies` parameter, which I am guessing is meant to be isomorphic to the Module Manifest's `RequiredAssemblies` key.  This \"law of nature\" is also not documented anywhere, but for the sake of this discussion and drawing a circle around \"assembly loading context\" design space, it is purposeful to highlight.\r\n    2. `Get-Help Add-Type -Examples` returns nothing.  Before we go adding new parameters to this cmdlet, I suggest we fix the documentation.  What's the point in having a technical discussion if there is no specification and examples of the specification in action?\r\n3. CLR `System.Reflection` knobs\r\n    1. `[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom` , the behavior for which is defined in [Deploying .NET Framework Applications > How the Runtime Locates Assemblies > Initiating the Bind](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/deployment/how-the-runtime-locates-assemblies#initiating-the-bind)\r\n    2. `[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName` **deprecated**\r\n4. Please add additional knobs I am unaware of in your replies to this thread.\r\n\r\nIn this vein, I have found StackOverflow user _Bacon Bits_ answer to \"How to load assemblies in PowerShell?\" quite helpful, in that he delves into \"[How do I verify what I loaded?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35702348/1040437)\"\r\n\r\nFurther in this vein, I think it would be great to name named contexts.  This could be essentially the same as \"[var jq = $.noConflict()](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_noconflict.asp)\" JavaScript trick the jQuery library uses: it releases the existing named context and replaces it with a new variable (ideally a locally scoped variable!).  This is also not much different than how, in C#, you can specify a namespace alias, including the [global namespace alias](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/namespaces/how-to-use-the-global-namespace-alias).",

    "body": "Is this on the roadmap for the PowerShell team at anytime?\r\n\r\nThe need to load in NuGet Packages (in this case the one that seems to keep coming up is the SMO Tooling, in addition to this thread here is another one https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/issues/623) seems to be a pretty common scenario for a lot of developers.\r\n\r\nThe current work arounds (provided by @MartinHBA and @mklement0 in #11860) aren't super great. Massive kudos to you two though because you show up in many of these threads! Here's another public blog post that tries to work around the issue as well http://www.maxtblog.com/2020/03/streamlining-sql-server-management-objects-smo-in-powershell-7-revised/. While we appreciate that it is a way to move forward they all basically boil down to:\r\n\r\n1. Copying the Appropriate DLL's out of the various referenced NuGet Packages (or creatively referencing them from their NuGet locations)\r\n2. Performing an `Add-Type` for each of the dependency assemblies\r\n\r\nThis is a bit of a pain, especially because the `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.runtime` package ships a native binary that will require you to determine if you're going to run x64 vs x86 and then have the native assembly sitting next to the managed assembly. This makes automating this in any type of pipeline wherein you do not have full control over the machine difficult.\r\n\r\nThe path of least resistance in these cases has been to build a \"dummy\" binary that pulls in all of the NuGet Packages into a single output and then commit this into version control. This completely subverts the powerful tooling that NuGet was supposed to provide to us to keep our repositories free from binaries.\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"http://www.maxtblog.com/2020/03/streamlining-sql-server-management-objects-smo-in-powershell-7-revised/\">Streamlining SQL Server Management Objects (SMO) In PowerShell 7 (Revised) – Max Trinidad – The PowerShell Front</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
