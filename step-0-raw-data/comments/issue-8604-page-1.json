Nothing really important, up until you are comparing strings that have been generated using ConvertTo-Json. Only then it will matter.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI just would like to share what fixed my issue, just in case, somebody outthere faces the same problem in the future:\r\nThe first thing I did, is to use the switch \"-Compress\" delivered with ConvertTo-Json to compress the json, and remove all the formating stuff. This mostly fixed all the issues I had, except for cases where I had empty arrays. Where on PS6 I got ```[]``` but on ps 5.1 ```[ ]``` (See the extra space in ps5.1?)\r\nFor that I used the following function\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Thanks to Jakob Jares for the tip!\r\nfunction Clear-WhiteSpace ($Text) {\r\n    \"$($Text -replace \"(`t|`n|`r)\",\" \" -replace \"\\s+\",\" \")\".Trim()\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCheers",
