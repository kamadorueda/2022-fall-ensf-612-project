I didn't recognize \"first most commonly used\" as potentially being the same as declaration order):\r\n\r\n* declaration order for `-<tab>`\r\n* alphabetic order for `-<prefix><tab>`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThat said, what would make the distinction moot and would allow us to stick with declaration order consistently  is if we could get _realtime feedback_ on what the completion _would_ be, as you're typing, which is what Visual Studio Code already does:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/588825/43541472-82df9d4c-9598-11e8-8b24-decc50c65fd8.png)\r\n\r\nYou then  just need to keep an eye on the currently selected match and keep typing more of the prefix if the right one isn't selected yet - no need to use `<tab>` to cycle.\r\n\r\nIs it possible to bring this type of instant-feedback UI to PSReadLine, @lzybkr?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thinking about this some more:\r\n\r\nI don't think the alphabetic sorting in the case of prefix matching is worth it, after all.\r\nIn all likelihood, you'll probably just cycle _until the right parameter name appears_, without even thinking about ordering at all, so whatever the order is, you probably won't pay attention to  it or take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nThe only real improvement I see is from the realtime feedback feature I mentioned. Simply typing without interruption until the right parameter name appears and _then_ tab-completing seems like the best solution to me (again: not sure if we can get that in the terminal).\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the good old ISE offers that too, and even throws in _substring_ matching, with prefix matches given precedence:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/588825/43671917-1c591974-9771-11e8-9160-ffd50bf8c239.png)\r\n\r\n`-ou` selects the first _prefix_ match (`-OutVariable`, in common-parameter declaration order, I presume, before `-OutBuffer`), but also shows _substring_ matches (other parameters that contain `ou`).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of declaration order: I haven't looked at other cmdlets, but `Get-Content` is an example where the order warrants fixing: currently, you get `-ReadCount`, `-TotalCount` , and `-Tail` as the first 3 completions.\r\n\r\nI've modified the title and the initial post to make this topic generically about improvements to parameter-name tab-completion.\r\n\r\nIf no one is interested in continuing this conversation, I'm also happy to close it.\r\n",
