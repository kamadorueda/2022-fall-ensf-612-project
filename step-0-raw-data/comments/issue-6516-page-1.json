The below makes no difference whatsoever.\n\nAnd I don’t know how it could (make a difference) — Get-Help isn’t doing the rendering, it’s just displaying what’s in the file. What is in the about*.help.txt file(s) should be already rendered text (and is, on every other about I’ve looked at, including at least one other one with a table, i.e. about_special_characters. The problem is with the about_profile.help.txt file; the text isn’t properly rendered in that file.\n\nI created an issue in Powershell-Docs for this.\n\n(On a different note, I tried cut-and-pasting (with Ctrl-V) your below line into the pwsh session, and it doesn’t work. And it turns out ctrl-V doesn’t work from anywhere. \"Enable ctrl key shortcuts\" is checked on the shortcut/session. Works fine in 5.1.)\n\n> On Mar 27, 2018, at 8:25 PM, Steve Lee <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Seems to happen due to setting $outputencoding = [System.Console]::OutputEncoding.
