    "body": "> There was concerns about new automatic variables scoped only to this usage but would needed to be documented in the about_automaticvariables topic which may create some confusion. \r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT Was the prospect of providing the callback parameters to the scriptblock by way of properties on `$_` contemplated?  That feels like the most PowerShell-ey style to me.  There is precedent for non-pipeline use of `$_` instead of `param()` in [ValidateScript()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_functions_advanced_parameters?view=powershell-5.1#validatescript-validation-attribute).  \r\n\r\nI've been favoring `$_` over `param()` for scriptblock predicates like `ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback` mainly because the `param()` block ends up being repeated, often overshadows the predicate in character count, and usually doesn't provide much useful information to a reader.\r\n\r\nHere's a mock-up of `param()` vs `$_` for illustration:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n{\r\n    param($Message,$Cert,$Chain,$PolicyErrors)\r\n    Assert-CertificateCompliance -Policy Strict -Message $Message -Cert $Cert -Chain $Chain -PolicyErrors $PolicyErrors\r\n}\r\n\r\n{$_ | Assert-CertificateCompliance -Policy Strict}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor me the point of this PR is to be able to impose per-URL certificate requirements.  So I'll end up with policy data structures looking something like this:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n@{\r\n    Uri = 'https://github.com'\r\n    CertificateValidator = {\r\n        $_ | Assert-CertificateCompliance -Policy Strict\r\n        $_ | Assert-Certificate Server -Thumbprint d79f076110b39293e349ac89845b0380c19e2f8b\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n@{\r\n    Uri = 'https://www.powershellgallery.com'\r\n    CertificateValidator = {\r\n        $_ | Assert-CertificateCompliance -Policy Strict\r\n        $_ | Assert-Certificate Intermediate -Thumbprint ‎98af62baa639b0827f887c75a77f4afd4eff2685\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe validation scriptblock gets repeated for each uri so noise from `param()` adds up.",

    "body": "> ...I did tests where the event triggers updated a variable at that same time as callback and that resulted in a hang.\r\n\r\nI'm curious what these tests looked like.  It doesn't seem like `Register-ObjectEvent` naturally accepts `PSVariable`s in its parameters.  It also doesn't seem like the `Register-ObjectEvent -Action` scriptblock has access the call site's variables.  In the tests that hung how did the event handler get a reference to the same variable as the callback?\r\n\r\n> I have incorporated the $_. I'm open for suggestions on renaming the members. Right now they are Request, Certificate, CertificateChain, and SslErrors.\r\n\r\nI see that [the current documentation for `HttpClientHandler.ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclienthandler.servercertificatecustomvalidationcallback?view=netcore-2.0#System_Net_Http_HttpClientHandler_ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback) doesn't name its parameters.  For that matter, there is very little documentation about the semantics of that callback altogether.  dotnet/corefx#24774 might improve that documentation and that might lead to parameter names.  If `ServerCertificateCustomValidationCallback` does end up with documented parameter names, it seems like the properties on `$_` should have identical names.  The closest documented callback interface seems to be [full .net's `System.Net.Security.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.security.remotecertificatevalidationcallback?view=netframework-4.7.1).  I propose adopting the corresponding names from that callback interface in the meantime.\r\n\r\n> The down side is that the ScriptBlock is now devoid of the calling scope. I was originally under the impression it would need to be done this way and I think that so long as it is documented it should be acceptable. Any of the other means of making the scope available results in either unpredictable behavior or hangs. I think no scope is better than some broken scope.\r\n\r\nIs there a reason that the scope rules wouldn't be the same as for other scriptblocks using [remote variables](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_remote_variables?view=powershell-5.1)?  [`Invoke-Command`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/invoke-command?view=powershell-5.1)` -Session -ScriptBlock`, for example, provides access to local variables in the remote session by way of the `$using:` expression.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I think this would be a pretty awkward interface without having some way of making user objects available in the callback scriptblock.  A natural use would be as follows:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n@{\r\n    u='https://github.com/some/important/file'\r\n    thumbprint = 'd79f076110b39293e349ac89845b0380c19e2f8b'\r\n},\r\n@{\r\n    u='https://powershellgallery.com/some/other/important/file'\r\n    thumbprint = '98af62baa639b0827f887c75a77f4afd4eff2685'\r\n} |\r\n    % { \r\n        $thumbprint = $_.thumbprint\r\n        # ... do some prep things\r\n        Invoke-WebRequest $_.u -CertificateValidationScript {\r\n            # ... a bunch of tests that are identical for every certificate\r\n            $_.Certificate.Thumbprint -eq $using:thumbprint\r\n        }\r\n        # ... do some cleanup things\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout `$using:`, arguments, or some other means of passing data, it will be tough to separate the concern of which thumbprints are acceptable for which url from the concern of checking for certificate revokation, for example.",

Unless it is documented on this API, we should use something generic that is easier for PowerShell users to use. `Sender` is a terrible choice when it's an `HttpRequestMessage`. If Sender were the documented name for this API, then I would concede that's probably better. \r\n\r\n> Is there a reason that the scope rules wouldn't be the same as for other scriptblocks using\r\n\r\n`$using` in every instance I've seen is a unique implementation. If there were a generic API for adding this capability to a `ScriptBlock`, then `$using:` would be awesome to have here. but I see no point in adding yet-another-using-implimentation for validation callbacks on cmdlets that don't normally do any work with `ScriptBlock`s.\r\n\r\n> Without $using:, arguments, or some other means of passing data,..\r\n\r\nErm, not really? I mean yea, not on the ease of use level that using variables from the calling scope or `$using:`, but, most validation logic is fairly static, in my experience. Create module, Import it in the ScriptBlock, magic. or use CSV, Clixml, JSON files for confgis if you don't wants it hard coded in the the PS Script.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is ideal. What I am saying is that I can't see a safe way to get the calling scope available in the remote scope with out severely over-complicating the implementation.\r\n\r\nAlso, these validations scripts are \"per call\". For 6.1 I want to look at adding session persistent options. One of them will be add your own .NET delegates for cert validation, So if you want to have some variable magic then you can. The goal in this PR is to provide the basic implementation that will work for most people on a \"per call\" basis. I think most will just need to ensure a static thumbprint or 2 against URLs. Complex validation scenarios are not the goal of the implementation in this PR, but are on my radar for the futre.",
