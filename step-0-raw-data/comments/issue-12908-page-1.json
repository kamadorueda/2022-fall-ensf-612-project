    "body": "Keep in mind that you could have a process name itself with one or more parentheses.  Something like:\r\n\r\n`17718 (really weird process(  ) name) T 15873 17718 15873 34816 ....`\r\n\r\nSince, per standard, the rest of the line should all be numeric fields, it might be valuable to look for the ')' in reverse and then parse from there.  You could also do a regular expression, but you have to anchor it to the start and end to ensure proper parsing:\r\n\r\n`'^\\d+ \\(.+\\) [A-Z] (?<parent>\\d+)(?: \\d+){48}$'`\r\n\r\nIn the above, the 'parent' named capture group would be the parent PID.  The regular expression, while computationally expensive, is probably the most robust way in my opinion.",
