    "body": "> @KirkMunro Is it possible to split the PR on some small ones? The PR is so large that we can wait too long for approval.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like quite a bit more work, with little tangible value; however, a \"review map\" might help. Here is a break down of the changes in each file, with like changes grouped together to allow them to be reviewed more easily. Between these extra details and being able to mark files as viewed in the GitHub UI, I think it should be much easier for others to review this PR.\r\n\r\n### Cleanup of changes done in @TylerLeonhardt's other PR that this supercedes\r\n\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/New-PSBreakpoint.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/EnableDisableRunspaceDebugCommand.cs`\r\n- simple removal of changes added by @TylerLeonhardt in PR #8923; instead of\r\ncreating breakpoints using `New-PSBreakpoint` and passing breakpoints into\r\n`Enable-RunspaceDebug`, breakpoints are managed on a runspace using the\r\noriginal set of `*-PSBreakpoint` cmdlets.\r\n\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/PSBreakpointCreationBase.cs`\r\n- simple removal of previous refactoring work that was done in the same PR\r\n\r\n`src/Modules/Unix/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.psd1`\r\n`src/Modules/Windows/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.psd1`\r\n- removed `New-PSBreakpoint` reference\r\n- changed experimental feature name/description to match what it actually does now\r\n(this was previously missing from the Windows version of the file, and would have been\r\nadded in #9907 if this PR didn't supercede it)\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InitialSessionState.cs`\r\n- removed `New-PSBreakpoint` reference\r\n\r\n`test/powershell/engine/Basic/DefaultCommands.Tests.ps1`\r\n- removed `New-PSBreakpoint` reference\r\n\r\n`test/powershell/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Enable-RunspaceDebug.Tests.ps1`\r\n- removed this file as it was based on the other PR that this supercedes\r\n\r\n### Changes for Pester tests\r\n\r\n`test/powershell/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/RunspaceBreakpointManagement.Tests.ps1`\r\n- added tests for runspace breakpoint management (both local and remote runspaces)\r\n\r\n`test/tools/TestMetadata.json`\r\n- updated to match new experimental feature name and test file\r\n\r\n### Changes to support `-Runspace` parameter in `*-PSBreakpoint` commands\r\n\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/RunspaceParameter.cs`\r\n- defined a transformation attribute that converts integers, GUIDs and strings into\r\nrunspaces; this is for use in the `-Runspace` parameter added to the `*-PSBreakpoint`\r\ncmdlets updated below (it keeps the number of parameter sets low in those commands\r\nwhile still supporting multiple ways to reference a runspace)\r\n\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/PSBreakpointCommandBase.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/PSBreakpointAccessorCommandBase.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Get-PSBreakpoint.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Set-PSBreakpoint.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/PSBreakpointUpdaterCommandBase.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Disable-PSBreakpoint.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Enable-PSBreakpoint.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Remove-PSBreakpoint.cs`\r\n- added `-Runspace` parameter to each `*-PSBreakpoint` cmdlet\r\n- standardized parameter set names across this set of cmdlets\r\n- refactored `*-PSBreakpoint` cmdlets into class hierarchy, as follows:\r\n    ```none\r\n                           PSBreakpointCommandBase\r\n                              /              \\\r\n    PSBreakpointAccessorCommandBase        PSBreakpointUpdaterCommandBase\r\n                 |                                       |\r\n     Get/SetPSBreakpointCommand        Disable/Enable/RemovePSBreakpointCommand\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n### Changes to support managing breakpoints in debugger via the SDK\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/debugger/Breakpoint.cs`\r\n- fixed minor issue in display of breakpoint that was hit when attaching\r\nthe debugger to a remote runspace\r\n- updated RemoveSelf method to return a bool if a breakpoint was removed\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/debugger/debugger.cs`\r\n- added SetCommandBreakpoint, SetLineBreakpoint, SetVariableBreakpoint,\r\nRemoveBreakpoint, EnableBreakpoint, and DisableBreakpoint public methods\r\nin Debugger class\r\n- added DebugJob method that allows you to attach a debugger to a job\r\nwithout invoking a BreakAll\r\n- changed return type of AddCommandBreakpoint, AddLineBreakpoint and\r\nAddVariableBreakpoint on ScriptDebugger class to be specific to the type\r\nof breakpoint they add\r\n- removed New*Breakpoint methods on ScriptDebugger class (these have been\r\nsuperceded by the Set*Breakpoint public methods)\r\n- updated Remove*Breakpoint methods to return a bool indicating whether or\r\nnot a breakpoint was removed\r\n- defined overrides in ScriptDebugger for the *Breakpoint methods that were\r\nadded to the base class, and grouped them together (this involved replacing\r\nsome methods that were previously internal)\r\n- moved a few methods into proper groupings according to existing regions\r\n- defined overrides in NestedDebugger for the *Breakpoint methods that were\r\nadded to the base class\r\n- added internal virtual function names for breakpoint functions that can now\r\nbe invoked in a remote runspace\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/client/remoterunspace.cs`\r\n- added overrides to remote debugger for the *Breakpoint methods that were\r\nadded to the base class\r\n- added internal helper method to handle invoking those methods remotely,\r\ncapturing their results, and processing any errors\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/client/Job.cs`\r\n- added IsFinished property to simplify code elsewhere that checks if a job\r\nis finished\r\n- added new *Breakpoint* methods to JobDebugger class and grouped them together\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/server/ServerRunspacePoolDriver.cs`\r\n- added support for the new *Breakpoint virtual functions to the\r\nPreProcessDebuggerCommand method\r\n- added overrides for *Breakpoint methods to ServerRemoteDebugger class\r\n- added override for new DebugJob overload method to ServerRemoteDebugger class\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/serialization.cs`\r\n- added `RehydrationFlags.NullValueOk` to `Script` and `Action` properties of\r\nbreakpoints (this ensures they are set to null instead of empty when rehydrated,\r\nwhich matches how they are set before they are dehydrated)\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/hostifaces/PSDataCollection.cs`\r\n- added AddRange method to simplify adding a collection to a collection\r\n\r\n### Addition of `-NoInitialBreak` parameter to `Debug-Job` and `Debug-Runspace`, plus refactoring\r\n\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/resources/Debugger.resx`\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/resources/RemotingErrorIdStrings.resx`\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/resources/DebuggerStrings.resx`\r\n- moved a bunch of resource strings into src/System.Management.Automation/resources/DebuggerStrings.resx\r\nas part of the refactoring of `DebugRunspaceCommand` and `DebugJobCommand` under\r\na common base class\r\n- added some resource strings\r\n\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/commands/PSRemoteDebugCmdlet.cs`\r\n`src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/DebugRunspaceCommand.cs`\r\n`src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/commands/DebugJob.cs`\r\n- added `-NoInitialBreak` parameter to `Debug-Runspace` and `Debug-Job` cmdlets\r\n- moved common code out of the cmdlet classes into new `PSRemoteDebugCmdlet` class\r\n- refactored these two cmdlets to eliminate unintended differences in the UX they\r\nprovided into a class hierarchy, as follows:\r\n    ```none\r\n               PSRemoteDebugCmdlet\r\n                 /              \\\r\n    DebugJobCommand        DebugRunspaceCommand\r\n    ```\r\n",

    "body": "@PaulHigin FYI for when you do get to look at this:\r\n\r\nI'm experiencing an intermittent issue with my `RunspaceBreakpointManagement.Tests.ps1` Pester test series where setting a breakpoint in a remote runspace (i.e. one associated with a background job) gets stuck. On my system, when I don't have my VS 2019 debugger connected to the PowerShell session process, I can very often reproduce my intermittent issue the _second_ time that I manually invoke that Pester test file in a single PowerShell session. All tests pass in the first run, but the second run hangs at a certain point (the moment the first MS-PSRDP call is made. Digging in to this on my system, I believe it's getting stuck between the moment it invokes the virtual `__Set-PSBreakpoint` function in a nested PowerShell instance, which should set the breakpoint on the remote runspace. The local process seems to be waiting for the pipeline to finish, and the debugger in the remote (job) process seems to be waiting for a client to connect to it, so this seems to have to do with the MS-PSRDP. If you wait long enough (30 minutes), the Pester test eventually fails (probably due to a timeout) with a `PSRemotingTransportException`.\r\n\r\nIn the PR that this supercedes, @TylerLeonhardt switched many of the collections to their concurrent equivalent, and he updated the breakpoint ID increment to be thread safe as well. Those changes were preserved through this PR work.\r\n\r\nI know little about how the MS-PSRDP plumbing works other than what I learned while working on this PR, so I wanted to let you know what I ran into so that you could have a look when you get to this review work because so far I can't figure out the root cause.",

In particular, the changes to the remoting protocol should be separate.  To support these remoting changes, we need to update the protocol version and update capability to ensure down level compatibility.  In addition, the protocol documents must also be updated with the new protocol version additions.  This is an absolute requirement for Windows.\r\n\r\nI don't believe we ported all of the remote debugging tests (cc @JamesWTruher), and this makes it difficult to know if any regressions are introduced.  So we need to be careful of any changes we make to the remoting parts.",

We appreciate the effort to help improve the debugging experience, however, this PR as it currently exists is too large (size and scope) and risky (due to lack of our own complete test coverage) to accept.  If we are to review PRs like this in the future, we will need:\r\n\r\n  - The changes to be split into multiple PRs:\r\n    - refactoring with adequate test coverage (PS Team has existing debugging tests that can be shared, but needs to be ported from an internal (will not be OSS) test framework to Pester/XUnit)\r\n    - local debugging\r\n    - remote debugging (evaluate if this is necessary due to protocol changes)\r\n  - Protocol changes necessitate a change to the protocol documentation which is not a small effort and should be a separate item and also involves cross remoting version validation\r\n",
