This big change here is to fix the GUIDs for all the file components.  This allows the file components to be patched (using an MSP, which is required by Microsoft Update for Security Patches.) \r\n\r\nAfter we merge most of the MSI PRs I have pending, I'll submit the main implementation for RFC.  I'll mark it as a WIP until the RFC is done.",

We need to remove all references to the specific version numbers from the GUI.  Otherwise, when you are applying the 6.0.3 patch to 6.0.2 MSI, the patch will still say 6.0.2.  Perhaps there is a way to use the actual MSI version at runtime.  I'll have a PR for that sometime after this is merged.",
