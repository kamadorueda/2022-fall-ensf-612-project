    "body": "> The Issue does suggest that instead of the original command it shows the alias in the syntax but the `Syntax` property is read-only and I didn't want to mess around with the base CommandInfo or AliasInfo object for something like this, not doing that also somewhat enables @KirkMunro's request that it shows the `alias -> real command` as part of the output since it'll now show the resolved command name in the syntax'.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to change the `Syntax` property for this. `Get-Command ... -Syntax` returns a single string. All you need to do to show a more meaningful (and technically more correct) output is to modify the syntax strings you retrieve from the command associated with that alias, by replacing the leading command name with the name of the alias.\r\n\r\ni.e. When you discover that it is an alias, store the alias name, and then later when you retrieve the command syntax, replace the command name with the alias name in the output, while also pre-pending that output with a comment showing the alias to command relationship.\r\n\r\nThis will be very helpful when an alias references a script path, because you'll see the alias in the output syntax (which is the command you requested syntax for), while also seeing that the command you're requesting syntax for is actually an alias for another command (good for awareness/educational purposes).\r\n\r\nI'd really like to see the output from this match something more along these lines:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# First, create a script file\r\n@'\r\n[CmdletBinding()]\r\nparam(\r\n    [Parameter(Position=0, Mandatory, ValueFromPipeline, ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]\r\n    [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\r\n    [string[]]\r\n    $Name\r\n)\r\nprocess {\r\n    \"Processing ${Name}\"\r\n}\r\n'@ | out-File ${env:USERPROFILE}\\Test-GcmSyntax.ps1\r\n\r\n# Now set up an alias for that file\r\nnew-alias tgs ${env:USERPROFILE}\\Test-GcmSyntax.ps1\r\n\r\n# Get the command syntax using the alias\r\ngcm -syntax tgs\r\n```\r\n\r\nDesired output:\r\n\r\n```none\r\ntgs is an alias for C:\\Users\\kirka\\Test-GcmSyntax.ps1\r\n\r\ntgs [-Name] <string[]> [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make that work, you can inject the alias definition at the top (wrapping a script path in quotes if it has spaces), and then use regex to replace `\"^Test-GcmSyntax.ps1\"` (or an actual command name if it was an alias for a command instead of for a script) with `\"tgs\"`.\r\n\r\nIf we don't agree on showing the alias definition at the top, at a minimum I would expect the syntax to show the alias name instead of the command/script it points to.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative, we could leave the syntax as-is, and just show the alias note at the top so that users see first that they asked for syntax for an alias, and then they see the syntax for the command that is being aliased.\r\n\r\nAs another alternative, we could show the alias details in verbose output instead, so that users only see it when invoking the command with `-Verbose`. I don't love that though because people should realize when they are looking at an alias, so we really need to show them that detail. They see that when they invoke `Get-Command` without `-Syntax`, but they should really see it when they invoke it with `-Syntax` as well.\r\n",

Get-Command already returns all of that information when you don't specify the `-Syntax` switch, even when specifying an alias or wildcard. If you're wanting to work with the syntax of a command in a programmatic way then you're going to ignore the `-Syntax` switch and work directly with the Parameters attribute (or write regex to parse the `-Syntax` output but that seems like a mistake given Parameters exists).",

Whatever `Get-Command` does when you pass it a command name that results in the module auto-loading should happen when you pass it an alias name, with it auto-loading the module that contains that command before it pulls information about that command so that it can show the proper information.\r\n\r\nNote that I say all of this without looking at the code, so this is theoretical, but I think that this work is related enough to this PR and shouldn't be too difficult to figure out since `gcm` already worked for cmdlets in modules that were not loaded yet.",
