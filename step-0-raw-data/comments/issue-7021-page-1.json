Is this a problem now with tests (and results) being spread across 2 build jobs? Maybe in the case of an actual daily build (i.e. not a feature commit, the `Test-DailyBuild` function does not disambiguate them) we need to run all tests in one job then.",

Maybe it was because it was triggered by a push that included 3 commits (a merge commit to pull upstream changes in, a commit from myself and then the empty feature commit at last), which might have confused AppVeyor... I tried something similar again below (ie. `git pull upstream master; git commit -m '[feature]' --allow-empty; git push` to check if that might have been the reason but it worked again, therefore I can only conclude we must have had a flaky build for unknown reasons.\r\nWhat do you think about my [question](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/7021#issuecomment-395853603) about code coverage of the daily build?",

    "body": "@bergmeister We have considered VSTS.  I have already reserved `powershell.visualstudio.com`.  One issue I'm aware of, VSTS Hosted Linux uses an Ubuntu container not a VM and our tests currently have issues with containers.  There is a PR to get this partially working https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6953.  I doubt the author will do more work.  I'm fine as long as the build works, we tag tests somehow as not working with docker and file an issue to fix the tests (hopefully with some sort of breakout into smaller pieces.)\r\n\r\nI plan to move PowerShell-Docker to VSTS when I get the issues worked out (the CI builds aren't running even though the webhook fires.)",
