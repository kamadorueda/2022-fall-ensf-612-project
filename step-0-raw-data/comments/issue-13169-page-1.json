In other words, if the stated version is not in the PSCompatibleVersions list, PowerShell won't even _try_ to run the script. Many scripts are compatible, which is why later versions will still try to run scripts written for older versions. But not all, as you've seen here. Typically adjustments needed are minor, though; for instance, there's a good chance if you simply replace the `Get-WmiObject` calls with `Get-CimInstance` instead, it will probably work.\r\n\r\nIt's more about preventing earlier versions of PS from trying to run scripts which may contain language features that were introduced later on, to the best of my knowledge. ðŸ™‚ ",
