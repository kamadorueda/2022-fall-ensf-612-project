It is valid (but unusual) to have leading spaces in a file name (trailing spaces is less usual but also valid) - or indeed in the extension. \r\nSpecifying a trim copes with case that the user didn't type what they intended, but it's a sure bet that if `trim()` is applied to input someone will complain that they tried to do `set-content` or `out-file` and include spaces in the name and PowerShell won't let them. \r\nIsn't the answer to this (a) only use quotes on the command line where needed and (b) only around the characters you intend to be part of the file name ? \r\n\r\nDoes any other shell do a it as suggested ?

BaseName has an implementation that is misbehaving and could return more than just the filename without it's extension (original bug report here).\r\n2. Discrepancies between different providers in terms of trimming trailing whitespaces.\r\n3. Trailing whitespaces in file names *should* be allowed (according to @jhoneill), causing all implementations that explicitly trims trailing whitespace on file creation (New-Item, \"cmd > filename\" and just creating a new file in explorer.exe to mention three) to break compatibility with the file system(?).",

What I wrote implies that the file-name-including-extension can have trailing spaces which isn't correct, sorry for creating confusion. \r\n\r\n1. Basename is implemented by .Net, does look like a bug and should be sent over there (perhaps by the PowerShell team).  \r\n2. PowerShell providers appear to be lazy and pass unmodified names to whatever the providing for, I _think_ (for example) the registry API will create a key or value with spaces at the end, but the file system trims spaces from the end of the path (so after the extension).  Having the registry provider treat some legal paths as invalid to make all providers do the same thing is probably not a good path to go down\r\n3. No, what @iSazonov  said above is correct: the windows API trims anything at the end of the path. I gave an example of spaces around the dot between name and extension, which works in Windows explorer , PowerShell etc. But if you try to add spaces at the very end, they're removed in PowerShell and Explorer.  I don't know what rules linux or mac file systems apply, and can't test from the machine I'm on, but I would say it is for the file system to decide how a given name is handled (if at all -the windows fs won't let you use \"lpt1\" but I think linux will, and I think there are differences over illegal characters, the provider shouldn't intervene). \r\n  \r\n**TLDR**  Basename is bug for .NET , the rest is by design. \r\n",

I don't think it is strictly a bug, but I do agree that what we expect to come back is the actual path of the file. \r\n\r\nIn this example we would not expect something which comes back from `Resolve-Path`  and is deemed OK by `Test-Path` to produce something invalid when used with `Join-Path`\r\n```\r\n >$myDir = resolve-path  $SomeStringWeDoNotControl\r\n> if ($myDir -and (Test-Path $myDir) ) {$myPsDir = Join-Path $mydir \"PowerShell\"} else {Write-warning \"Bad Directory\"}\r\n> $mypsdir\r\nC:\\Users\\James\\Documents     \\PowerShell\r\n```\r\n\r\n.Net can't decide what to do.  It trims trailing spaces from the full path, but keeps them from the name.  It should trim both or neither. \r\n```\r\n Get-item 'C:\\Users\\James\\Documents\\PowerShell\\profile.ps1  ' | %{ \"'$($_.fullname)'\", \"'$($_.name)'\" }\r\n'C:\\Users\\James\\Documents\\PowerShell\\profile.ps1'\r\n'profile.ps1  '\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo `Get-Item` I would leave untouched but ask the .NET folks to be consistent, and I'd have **all** the `-path` commands trim their inputs **on the right only**  (I haven't checked if  `split-path` keeps or removes trailing spaces, but I'd guess it keeps them)\r\n \r\n\r\n",
