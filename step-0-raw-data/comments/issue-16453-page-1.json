    "body": "> Parameter validation errors are pipeline terminating already so they do not change behavior with `ErrorActionPreference`\r\n\r\nIt's not always clear what's terminating and what isn't. Validation errors are before the command gets control of the error but ...\r\n```function test1 {\r\ndel noththere\r\n\"here\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest1 \r\ndel : Cannot find path  ....\r\n\r\nhere\r\n```\r\nJust what we'd expect. \r\n```\r\n function test2 {\r\ntry {del noththere } catch {\"there\"}\r\n\"here\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest2\r\ndel : Cannot find path \r\n\r\nhere\r\n```\r\nWe can't _catch_ the error because it's not really _thrown._  That needs an `errorAction Stop` \r\n```\r\n function test3 {\r\ntry {del noththere -ea Stop } catch {\"there\"}\r\n\"here\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest3\r\nthere\r\nhere\r\n```\r\nNow we can catch it, and if we don't catch it the function stops. \r\n```\r\nfunction test4 {\r\ndel noththere -ea Stop \r\n\"here\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest4\r\ndel : Cannot find path\r\n\r\n```\r\nNo surprises so far.  But let's put a validation error in ... \r\n```\r\nfunction test5 {\r\ndel noththere -credential 1\r\n\"here\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest5\r\nRemove-Item : Cannot process argument transformation  \r\nhere\r\n\r\n```\r\nSo a validation error doesn't terminate just like the OP noticed.  But you _can_ catch it.\r\n```\r\nfunction test6 {\r\ntry {del noththere -credential 1} catch {\"everywhere\"} \r\n\"here\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest6\r\neverywhere\r\nhere\r\n```\r\n EA Stop needs a bit of help to get the function to throw \r\n```\r\nfunction test7 {\r\ntry {del noththere -credential 1} catch {throw $_} \r\n\"here\"\r\n}\r\n\r\ntest7\r\nRemove-Item : Cannot process argument transformation\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see cases where people use `try  {...}  catch {throw $_}`  where it's not needed, and I think is a habit created by this kind of thing\r\n\r\n",
