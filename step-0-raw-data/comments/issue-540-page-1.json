Unfortunately we haven't managed to port everything to `netstandard` just yet, so some mixed projects have to use `net461`.\n\n> I'm also not seeing a direct dependency on Microsoft.WSMan.Management from Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK. Can you post your project.lock.json file?\n\nIt isn't a direct dependency, the dependency is Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK -> Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management -> Microsoft.WSMan.Management.

    "body": "Ah, I think I know what happened. We quit depending on Microsoft.WSMan.Management as a package and instead build it from source as a project in `src/Microsoft.WSMan.Management`.\n\n@daxian-dbw we'll probably need to build and publish Microsoft.WSMan.Management as a package.\n\n@masaeedu what you can do in the meantime is build the package yourself; a `dotnet pack --version-suffix alpha9` in that directory _ought_ to create the package (with the correct version). Then there's the matter of getting `dotnet restore` to find it, which should just amount to adding a new feed in your `nuget.config` that points to a local folder and sticking the package there.\n",
