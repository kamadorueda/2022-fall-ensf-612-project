    "body": "I was just thinking about this while working on a function in a module. I could easily set it up to accept the output of another function in the same module from the pipeline, except it needs to be run in parallel. Right now I'm debating adding the `Foreach-Object -parallel` inside the function (I really don't like this from a design standpoint), or just resigning to wrapping the function at runtime. It would be great to have the best of both worlds!\r\n\r\nI like the idea of making it an attribute of CmdletBinding. I would suggest that when `SupportsProcessInParallel` or `SupportsParallelProcessing` or whatever it's called is `$true` then the following common parameters should be available to control it: \r\n- `-Parallel` (switch to enable at runtime) \r\n- `-ThrottleLimit` (same as Foreach-Object)\r\n- `-AsJob` (same as Foreach-Object)",
