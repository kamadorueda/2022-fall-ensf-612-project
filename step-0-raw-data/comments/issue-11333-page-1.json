However, it doesn't seem to make sense to create a persistent drive in a remote session.  Once the remote session is closed the drive mapping doesn't need to persist, and creating a new remote session means having to create a new drive mapping, correct?",

    "body": "I'd like to revive this thread and try to resolve it. The issue does look like the dreaded 2nd hop problem where ICM is the first hop and New-PSDrive is the 2nd hop. \r\n\r\nICM+New-PSDrive works with `-ComputerName <name> -Authentication CredSSP`. I suppose CredSSP is allowing New-PSDrive to use the passed on credentials.\r\n\r\nICM+New-PSDrive does not work** if ICM is used as:\r\n```\r\n1. -HostName <name> -SSHTransport\r\n2. -ComputerName <name>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This works once and fails on subsequent attempts. This will work again, 15 minutes after the first attempt that worked. This is where the 'cached credentials must be expiring'. Just a theory.\r\n\r\nIf that is correct, can we force the cached credentials to expire? I'd really like to make `ICM -HostName` work for all platforms. \r\n\r\nOn the same lines, I do not see any other issues/documentation that discusses use of `ICM -HostName -SSHTransport` along with other cmdlets accessing remote systems (2nd ICM, New-PSDrive etc). Can you point me in the right direction?\r\n\r\n@PaulHigin can you have a look at this?",
