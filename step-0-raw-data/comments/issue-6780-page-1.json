    "body": "> As an aside, is there a way to control the filename value? If there was, I could work-around this by supplying the quotes myself. Also, I could see someone wanting to change the filename to something other than the original file's filename.\r\n\r\nFor the `-Form` way, no. This was intentionally simplistic. For customization, users can create their own `MultipartFormDataContent` objects and pass them to `-Body`.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the `-RequestFilter` Idea, but, I would consider accepting an `HttpRequestMessage`. The cmdlets do not send a raw request, so there is no way to really do what you are wanting, The Cmdlets use HttpClient and creates a `HttpRequestMessage` so we could consider allowing the user to supply their own.",
