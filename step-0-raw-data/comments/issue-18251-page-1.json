There is a long standing thing that `Resolve-path` won't resolve a non-existent path (and scripts rely on this to resolve an test in one). `test-path ..\\..\\foo -IsValid` returns true but `resolve-path ..\\..\\foo ` gives a \"doesn't exist\" error. It would be good if we could expand a relative path without resorting to `$ExecutionContext.SessionState.Path.GetUnresolvedProviderPathFromPSPath(\"..\\..\\foo\")` \r\n\r\n2. `New-Item` should probably resolve the path in this case.  As general rule for all software, if the user's intent is unambiguous, but is in a format which the API doesn't accept, it _should_ be the job of software, not the user to change the format. Exceptions to this are allowed (it's a _should_ not a _must_), but I don't think this is one of those. Not resolving just looks like an omission. ",
