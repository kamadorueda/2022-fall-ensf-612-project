This is similar to how content is truncated in other parts of PowerShell formatting.  Anyone writing progress needs to be thoughtful on the information being presented (like long file paths).  I'd rather than support multi-line output.\r\n\r\nDo you have a scenario that requires multi-line progress output?  Keep in mind that nested and multi-progress bars is supported, but each bar is limited to one line currently.",

Getting the error output to be shorter was held to be a Good Thing, yes?    \r\nDevelopers have figured out what should be transient (something for eyeballs while work is happening) generally don't force users to read stuff they don't need to, and make most of the \"hey this is what the program has done\" stuff  verbose / debug. It works well , but nothing is stopping developers writing commands in the style of Linux, just replace write-verbose with write-host .  So this proposal doesn't allow anything extra but would take away something good and distinctive.   \r\n\r\nAnything which has a loop of display progress message, output a row, and remove the progress message will - I suspect - get the messages interleaved with the output. \r\n",
