We use a configuration specific to the ConsoleHostUserInterface to allow it to re-prompt, without affecting other hosts that may also choose to implement it\r\n3. We decide that re-prompt is above the PSHostUserInterface's level and simply call the relevant prompt method multiple times\r\n\r\n(1) provides the most re-use, but is hardest to get right. One way is to provide a new method that re-prompts, itself calling one of the abstract methods, but meaning that commands not targeting PS 7.1 won't be able to re-prompt. Because commands need to call the overridden abstract method directly, we're quite constrained in our options.\r\n\r\n(2) is essentially a bad implementation of (1), so is probably not the right way to go.\r\n\r\n(3) is another possibility, which means we're more free to implement what we like, but means that other hosts (particularly the PowerShell extension for VSCode) won't get this improvement.",
