    "body": "I think we should wait until there is any issue reports that a user is really depending on the previous behavior, for the following reasons:\r\n1. IMHO, the previous behavior is more like a bug and unexpected to users. Take the following as an example, I think most users won't expect these 2 pipelines to behave differently depending on `$PSStyle.OutputRendering`, since this scenario is not about output rendering at all.\r\n    ```\r\n    Get-Content file-a | Set-Content file-b\r\n    Get-Content file-a > file-b\r\n    ```\r\n2. Given that the previous behavior may alter the string input when `$PSStyle.OutputRendering` is `Host` or `PlainText`, a user may run into the [spoofing issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements/issues/28) without knowing it when these 2 output rendering options are in use. So even if we add parameter to `Out-File` and `Out-String` to bring back the previous behavior, we probably still need to warn users to be cautious using this parameter, and later on, it may become a good-practice within the community to avoid using this parameter.\r\n\r\n3. If a user really want to remove Ansi escape sequences from strings, they can do it explicitly by using `StringDecorated` type (example below), or we can expose another cmdlet just for that. I think being explicit is better.\r\n    ```\r\n    Get-Content file-a | % { [System.Management.Automation.Internal.StringDecorated]::new($_).ToString(\"PlainText\") } | Out-File file-b\r\n    ```\r\nIf we know a user is actually depending on the previous behavior, it would make more sense to add a parameter to `Out-File` and `Out-String` to bring the previous behavior back.",

So from that perspective, documentation is sufficient and a warning is not necessary.\r\n\r\nThe Committee believes there is utility to have the previous behavior where a cmdlet (like `Select-String`) which explicitly adds VT codes (rather than go through formatting) and the user may want those removed before having something else process it as plain text.  Although you are correct that `[StringDecorated]` exposes this capability already, it's more dev centric and not discoverable compared to a switch on existing cmdlets.\r\n\r\nI'm personally ok waiting on user feedback, however, before adding this.",

The `MatchInfo.Line` doesn't contain VT codes, and if you use `Select-String -Raw`, it output strings, without VT codes.\r\n\r\nIt's possible for a cmdlet to directly output strings with VT codes, but in that case, it's more likely the VT codes are not for decoration purpose but something the caller is supposed to consume. By contrast, it's more likely for an executable to write out VT decorated strings, where removing the VT sequences becomes interesting. But be noted that, **a lot of executables are able to detect whether the stdout is redirected, and write out strings without VT codes in case of redirection**, such as `git`.\r\n\r\nHowever, for both cases, I think exposing another cmdlet just for removing VT sequences from strings is probably better, so that the operation is explicit and predictable (behavior won't change based on a global setting such as `$PSStyle.OutputRendering`).",

If a parameter to `Out-File` and `Out-String` is decided to be needed, we only need to update the docs of `Out-String` and `Out-File`. So, for the updates to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_ansi_terminals?view=powershell-7.2, I think we can go ahead and do it.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo-powershell-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_ansi_terminals\">about ANSI terminals - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>Describes the features of PowerShell that use ANSI escape sequences and the terminal hosts that support them.</div></blockquote>",

    "body": "> The proxy function is an interesting idea. But I assume you mean to have `Out-String/File -RemoveAnsi` to always remove ANSI, regardless of what `$PSStyle.OutputRendering` is. If so, then that's not the previous behavior anymore, but is still something we can consider, I guess.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of two cases \"always remove\" and \"conditionally-remove\". I think always is more common, but if it a script has \r\n` <external program> |  <removal tool >` I can see a desire for it to honour the value of `outputRendering`\r\n\r\n",
