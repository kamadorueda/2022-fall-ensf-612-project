We already have an `AvoidAlias` rule over there, though it was aggressively derided for being too noisy on people who didn't feel like aliases in scripts were a problem. Given everything with #1901, maybe it's time to bump it up to an `Error` level severity and tell the pro-alias folks to override `AvoidAlias` in their PSSA settings files. \n",

    "body": "I think turning off aliases needs to be tiered a bit rather than a simple on/off. Not all aliases are equally bad. I see the same discussion in PSScriptAnalyzer because its too noisy for core scenarios.\r\n\r\nAliases like `iwr`, `curl`, `gci`, `ls`, and `cat` are bad for two reasons:\r\n1. Too Short and hard to read\r\n2. Aliases to existing executables like curl, ls, and cat\r\n\r\nThe most useful aliases are: `Select`, `Where`, `Group`, `Sort`, `%`.\r\n\r\nI found when doing a lot with the pipeline, the % alias (ForEach-Object) is invaluable to actually making it readable because you can very quickly finding yourself with lots of nested foreach loops. Cutting that down to just % substantially simplifies the code. I know some people stay away from pipelines but I see % as important as | itself and once you get used to it, reads faster than foreach itself or ForEach-Object.\r\n\r\nSo at a minimum I think we should keep all of the Aliases for -Object since they are core fundamentals of PowerShell and reduce noise a lot. They are likely to be the most used aliases. The full list is below:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS C:\\> Get-Alias | Where ReferencedCommand -Like \"*-Object\" | Select DisplayName\r\n\r\nDisplayName              \r\n-----------              \r\n% -> ForEach-Object      \r\n? -> Where-Object        \r\ncompare -> Compare-Object\r\ndiff -> Compare-Object   \r\nforeach -> ForEach-Object\r\ngroup -> Group-Object    \r\nmeasure -> Measure-Object\r\nselect -> Select-Object  \r\nsort -> Sort-Object      \r\ntee -> Tee-Object        \r\nwhere -> Where-Object    \r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "The great features of the VSCode PowerShell extension during _editing_ notwithstanding, a strict mode of sorts that prevents _running_ scripts with aliases (ideally, at parse time) sounds useful.\r\n\r\nI agree with @dragonwolf83 that certain aliases, such as `%` and `?` are indispensable, but I think allowing aliases that shadow native utilities (e.g., `sort`) are problematic.\r\n\r\nSo, I think only the following aliases should still be permitted:\r\n\r\n* _built-in_ aliases (they are the only ones guaranteed to available - at least for a given PS version)...\r\n* ... that don't shadow native utilities on _any_ platform (in other words: the route that PS _Core_ has already chosen)\r\n\r\nAnother thing worth preventing in scripts is the use of _elastic syntax_ (e.g., `-Expand` for `-ExpandProperty`), because it threatens the long-term stability of the code (future parameters with the same prefix could render the previously unique prefix ambiguous).  \r\n(Not all such cases can be prevented however, such as in the case of indirect command execution via strings).\r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, it would be great if the VSCode PowerShell extension didn't just expand _aliases_ to their underlying commands, but expand _parameter-name prefixes_ to the full parameter names too - and possibly also for the recently proposed extension of elastic syntax to _operators_ - see #4730.\r\n\r\n",
