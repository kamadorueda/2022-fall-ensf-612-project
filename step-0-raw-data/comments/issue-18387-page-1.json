    "body": "@garretwilson PowerShell is trying to tell you **slowly** that you have missed the mandatory parameter & that if you want to learn more then you must enter `!?` to learn more.\r\n\r\nThis is a design decision due to the fact that PowerShell can be used to change state, and in many cases the operator, not the script author, may be rushing and not taking that much needed step back to ensure that the changes they want to enact are actually correct. It is also why we have Confirm & WhatIF built into the language, which when used properly is to help reduce accidental harms in System Administration, like an accidental deletion of everything in the C Drive.\r\n\r\nTo get your expected behaviour you should not use parameters but instead in the script make use of the `Read-Host` cmdlet however you'd lose the ability to run this non-interactively unless you made the parameter non-mandatory and then equated for either it being provided when called or after it was called. This is where you'll start to find you need to make choices whilst authoring scripts, dependant on how it is to be run and who is intended to run it & what skill level with PowerShell they have. \r\n\r\nI'd strongly suggest as someone new to PowerShell to come join the [PowerShell Slack](https://aka,ms/psslack) or [PowerShell Discord ](https://aka,ms/psdiscord) servers (which are bridged together so slack users can interact with discord users & vice versa) where you could ask a question like this ",

    "body": "Thank you for addressing _correctness of behavior_, by explaining that PowerShell here is functioning as (someone) intended. But your response failed to address _consistency with documentation_ and _usefulness_.\r\n\r\n### Consistency with Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation clearly and unambiguously says that PowerShell \"displays this message in the prompt that appears\". It doesn't say \"displays this message in a separate help screen that the user may access by pressing additional keystrokes at the prompt that appears\". The current behavior directly contradicts the documentation.\r\n\r\n### Usefulness\r\n\r\nUsers will not actually use the feature as implemented. Don't take my word for it. Let me just quote from `powershell.org`, [A Helpful Message about HelpMessage](https://powershell.org/2013/05/a-helpful-message-about-helpmessage/) (bold in the original):\r\n\r\n> Here’s my help message about HelpMessage:\r\n> **Don’t use it**! Users can’t see it. It does no harm, but it has no value. Danger lurks in writing a HelpMessage instead of writing help that users can see. … The language permits it. But it’s not useful).\r\n> …\r\n> When you omit a mandatory parameter, you get a message like this one: … `(Type !? for Help.)`\r\n> And then you type “!?” to get the HelpMessage value.\r\n> You’ve never done that? Me neither!\r\n\r\nNote specifically \"it has no value\" and \"it’s not useful\".\r\n\r\nYou also say:\r\n\r\n> To get your expected behaviour you should not use parameters but instead in the script make use of the `Read-Host` cmdlet …\r\n\r\nWell actually [`Read-Host` would have been my first choice](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8184861), but [other discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8236524) was adamant that this was an anti-pattern. I was only try to use best practices.",

Thanks for being up-front about that.\r\n\r\nAs I said my first inclination was to just ask the user, but most of the times when I ask questions like this, the answer is, \"No, you're thinking in the old DOS/Bash mindset; do it the PowerShell way\", and often the response comes with \"and you should be using `Param`, because they are awesome and take care of all your problems\". So I was trying to get on board, especially reading [things like this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8236524) (against use of `Read-Host`:\r\n\r\n> Using parameter binding is definitely the way to go here. Not only is it very quick to write (just add  `[Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]` above your mandatory parameters), but it's also the only option that you won't hate yourself for later.\r\n> …\r\n> [Read-Host](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh849945.aspx) is, quite simply, bad form.\r\n\r\nAnyway it sounds like for a lot of things there isn't agreement on best practices in the Powershell community. Thanks for helping explain that.\r\n\r\n(Although I really don't see what is wrong or so difficult about just printing the help message at the prompt. Seems like other experts [thought the same thing](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7093#issuecomment-420299268). And whoever wrote the documentation obviously thought it worked that way; the documentation isn't a typo—it was very clear and straightforward. But anyway I have more important things to tackle and I'll leave it at that.)",
