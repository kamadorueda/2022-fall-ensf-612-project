As an old hand rather than a self-identified n00b I learned the work round, usually use it and when I forget I say \"doh, that's stupid why was it never fixed\". \r\n\r\nIt doesn't need to be that way either\r\n``` \r\n[pscustomobject]@{path=\"c:\\windows\"} | set-location \r\n```\r\nShows that an object with a path property works for setting a location.  In fact it PATH has precedence over PSPath which is what CD is using, but files and directories have a `.fullname` property instead of `path`. \r\n\r\nYou can save this as \"mytypes.ps1xml\"\r\n```\r\n<Types><Type><Name>System.IO.DirectoryInfo</Name><Members><AliasProperty><Name>Path</Name><ReferencedMemberName>FullName</ReferencedMemberName></AliasProperty></Members></Type></Types>\r\n```\r\nand then run `Update-TypeData -AppendPath .\\mytypes.ps1xml` then directories support .Path , .Path trumps .PSPath and thing work the way they should. \r\n\r\nI've no idea why the onus is on you to do that, being broken for a long time turns into a reason to not fix I guess.
