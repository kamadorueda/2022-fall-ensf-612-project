Giving a cursory look at the docs ([NetworkCredential](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.networkcredential.domain?view=netcore-3.0) and [PSCredential](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscredential?view=pscore-6.2.0), we have to figure out things like whether to never populate `Password` (vs. `SecurePassword`), what to do with `Domain`, etc.\r\n\r\nAlso wondering aloud if there are any implications with our secrets management work (/cc @SydneyhSmith @PaulHigin)",
