    "body": "I think this issue might have to do with symbolic links need to know if it is a directory or a file based symlink.  MKLINK requires specifying the purpose of the symbolic link.  PowerShell is probably trying to find the target so that it can determine the type of link from the target.  That doesn't work when the target cannot be accessed at that time.\r\n\r\nI also tested creating a symbolic link to a non-existent server via a UNC path and got the same results, except that it could not find 'the network path', so I don't think it has to do with drives as I originally though.\r\n\r\nThis might require new enumerations for -itemtype (type) to bypass the target lookup.  I imagine this is not required for unix, and so this is probably a Windows only issue.",

This would require new new enumerations, but would require changing the definition of the parameter, and also handling the otherwise limited use of an array parameter.\r\n- If the type of link has been suggested, but PowerShell still insists on checking to see if it is the right choice (MKLINK does not care) there will be a delay with non-existent or unreachable UNC paths, and possibly with others if the media is offline at the moment.\r\n-Ppreviously I had found it more common to make symlinks for directories, but recently I have been relying on them to symlink files for the purpose of replacing VS Code's default grammar/syntax files with my own custom ones, as I am not ready to figure out how to replace them with an extension that could break other desired functionality.  I just have to replace the symlinks every time VS Code updates.",

    "body": "@jmg69, that's not how the filesystem works; symlinks have their own last-write timestamps (which never change, unless you recreate the symlink). \r\n\r\nTherefore, you must manually determine the target file (assuming it exists) and then query its properties:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$symlinkPath = './foo'\r\nGet-Item (Get-Item $symlinkPath).Target # use (...).LastWriteTime to get just the last-write time\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a given path may or may not be a symlink:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$potentialSymlinkPath = './foo'\r\n($item = Get-Item $potentialSymlinkPath).Target ? (Get-Item $item) : $item\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut please note that this issue is about symlinks with _non-existent_ targets.\r\nIf you have further questions, I suggest you use the following community resources: \r\n* The [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/powershell/shared_invite/enQtMzA3MDcxNTM5MTkxLTBmMWIyNzhkYzVjNGRiOTgxZmFlN2E0ZmVmOWU5NDczNTY2NDFhZjFlZTM1MTZiMWIzZDcwMGYzNjQ3YTRkNWM) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/AtzXnJM) community chat forums (they seamless talk to each other).\r\n* Q & A site [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/powershell) and the [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org/forums/) forum.\r\n",
