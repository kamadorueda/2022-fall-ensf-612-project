    "body": "Debug messages are pseudo-breakpoints, really. So... not the same thing.\r\n\r\nAnd having information messages be opt out is generally considered a bad idea because PS is an automation tool. If you want to code a wrapper function that provides a more user-focused interface, which automatically enables verbose or information streams as it runs subcommands, that's up to you, but it's generally considered best practice to expose automation-focused commands that do not pollute the output stream or the host environment with text the user hasn't explicitly asked for.\r\n\r\nThat out of the way... I'm not super familiar with how it works, but here's the file for Write-Host (took a bit of searching and digging, but there it is): https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/0f0c46dfe51440470b86f67b258e14aea32fa0aa/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WriteConsoleCmdlet.cs\r\n\r\nIf you use that as a base, I'm sure you can implement something similar. ðŸ˜„ ",
