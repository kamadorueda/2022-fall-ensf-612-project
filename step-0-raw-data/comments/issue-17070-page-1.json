The trap statement only covers statements within the same script block.\r\n\r\nYou need to put the trap in the same block (script block) where exception is thrown, or use try/catch in the same block.\r\nIf you don't attempt to continue execution from the exception, a new feature introduced in PowerShell 7.3 preview supports a new `clean` block for resource cleanup, which will act on exception thrown from any of the begin, process, or end blocks.\r\n",
