    "body": "I can confirm that the issue is present in Core as well (and equally affects advanced functions).\r\n\r\n(Note that, in general, If a problem affects Windows PowerShell only, you should report it at [uservoice.com](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell) instead.)\r\n\r\nTrying to decipher the message:\r\n\r\n* It sounds like the `91` is the character count of the specific argument passed.\r\n\r\n* \"character length\" is awkward; better to call it \"character count\" or \"string length\".\r\n\r\nThe message for a value that is too _short_ is analogous.\r\n\r\nSomething as simple as simple as the following would do, unifying the too-short and too-long messages and the dropping the _prescriptive_ part (\"Supply an argument ...\") altogether: \r\n\r\n> The character count is {actual-count}, which is outside the permissible range of {lower-bound} to {upper-bound}, inclusively.\r\n\r\nIt's probably worth revising the `[ValidateRange()]` error messages accordingly, which also have some awkwardness (\"less than the minimum allowed _range_ of 2\").\r\n\r\nP.S.: To me, the \"validate argument _on_ parameter\" in the generic prefix sounds awkward too; perhaps \"validate argument _for_\"?\r\n",
