We're happy to point you in the right direction and help you find any resources you need! ðŸ’– ",

I also didn't notice the PR that was already submitted.\r\n\r\nSo, for future reference: should I tackle only issues that are tagged `Up-For-Grabs` AND that do not have any submitted PRs? Is there anything else that I should maybe take into account?\r\n\r\nAnd finally, in regards to the current PR, should I close it personally?",

It is a bit of additional overhead, but we may want to be doing that during Hacktoberfest where it's more a possibility that we'll get collisions like this.\r\n\r\nIn general, it's probably best to comment on the issue and ask -- just in case. ðŸ™‚ Usually those PRs will reference the issue and become visible in the issue thread itself. In most cases, authors will comment in the issues themselves and ask if they can take care of it / mention that they're working on it so that folks know. But we're all human, and things can be overlooked! So it doesn't hurt to check, even if you don't see such a comment / PR reference. \r\n\r\nThere's a good handful of us keeping a watchful eye, so in most cases we'll jump in with an answer within a day or two at most. I can close this one for now, no worries. ðŸ˜Š \r\n\r\n",
