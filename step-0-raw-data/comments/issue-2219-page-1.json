    "body": "Wow! Really amazing you guys have tackled this. Feel like I'm quite late to this discussion.\r\n\r\nI personally found the usage of `$PSItem` took me a while to understand in the setter example above. The `get`/`set` syntax being basically C# I think creates the expectation of C#-like semantics where you have to explicitly create your own backing property if you want something more than just assignment and dereference of a backing field.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that PowerShell classes don't really have fields &mdash; PS class properties with no `get` or `set` are equivalent to C# class properties with `{ get; set; }` &mdash; so explicit `get` and `set` in PowerShell classes only really make sense with non-trivial bodies. But not all getters and setters need backing fields (they might be what EF calls a \"computed property\"), so `$PSItem` doesn't apply in all cases (not really a big problem -- this is true in other usages of $PSItem in PowerShell).\r\n\r\nI think part of the issue is that having syntax so close to C#'s creates an expectation of everything being like C#, but because .NET has getters and setters baked into it I think the syntax proposed is the most sensible (`get { ... }` is not unlike `begin { ... }`). Which basically means I think we should go with @SeeminglyScience's version where `$PSItem` only applies as the value in a setter.",

    "body": "@SeeminglyScience Thanks  again.\r\n\r\n> ...not too unlikely that some folks happened to name a method get_something...\r\n\r\nSo you're suggesting (are you?) that this might happen when there isn't a property called 'something'; and later the 'something' property gets added, and attempting to access it behaves oddly. That might be puzzling, but it doesn't actually break anything that worked before. Incidentally, I suppose I'm assuming that accessing a property via dot notation gets translated to a get_/set_ method call (because that's probably how I would do it, and the two behave the same at the moment); but I don't know whether that is true.\r\n\r\n> ...ideally it would be implemented inline...\r\n\r\nAgreed; and I take the point that there might be strange consequences if a user used both techniques on the same property. If necessary this could either be prevented as invalid syntax, dealt with on a 'defined priority' basis (like function definitions in different scopes), or just treated like other duplicate function definitions, i.e. \"last one wins\".\r\nIncidentally, I made the suggestion simply because the good work you did seems to be in limbo for want of someone to take it forward, and I thought this might be related to the perceived complexity of your solution; so it seemed sensible to ask \"what is the simplest thing that might work?\" - and that is what came to mind.",
