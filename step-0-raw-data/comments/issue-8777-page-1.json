This has resulted in a small handful of security and accessibility fixes, and some bug fixes to fix regressions associated with those two. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I want to talk to the Azure PowerShell team about this (/cc @sphibbs and @markcowl for context), as I don't want us limiting the adoption of `Az` in any way. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, using `Import-Module Az` explicitly (even without the full path, I believe), the module will load and you can use it. \r\n\r\nApparently, it may also be the case that `RequiredModules` will fail because it secretly uses `Get-Module -ListAvailable` under the hood (which is where we're doing the locale optimization). \r\n\r\nBut like I said, I'll follow up with the Azure PS to get their sense of the impact.\r\n\r\nPure curiosity and off-topic, but I'd also love to hear what's keeping you from using PowerShell Core. :) ",

But the user cannot call `Get-Module` to see what version of the module they have. \r\n\r\nWith everyone writing their own module install\\update logic, we have to walk the `$env:psmodulepath` just for this module to determine if we should install the module or update it. So we are leaving it on the end user to solve for this.",
