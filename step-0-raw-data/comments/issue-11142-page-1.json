Make it too easy for them, and they'll take the easy way without thinking about why they shouldn't do that.\r\n\r\nAlso, FWIW, if the @PowerShell/powershell-committee thinks `-Force` shouldn't be mandatory in this case, I would like that put in front of the PowerShell Community at large via an RFC rather than just forced in quietly.",

Having them also add a superfluous `-Force` is unnecessary and just adds to annoyance or worst invites users to add `Force = true` in PSDefaultParameters.",

    "body": "> As for `-Force`, the discussion in @PowerShell/powershell-committee is that the noun `SecureString` is already an indicator that care should be taken when using these cmdlets. The user already has to specify `-AsPlainText` to get plain text. Having them also add a superfluous `-Force` is unnecessary and just adds to annoyance or worst invites users to add `Force = true` in PSDefaultParameters.\r\n\r\nFor the uncommon occurrence where you want to convert plain text into a `SecureString`, requiring `-Force` isn't superfluous. It's a safety precaution -- a reminder to think twice about what you're doing. And it only requires 6 extra characters.\r\n\r\nWhen you say it's unnecessary and just adds to annoyance or invites users to add `$PSDefaultParameterValues['ConvertTo-SecureString:Force'] = $true`, do you have evidence that users are really annoyed by this or using `$PSDefaultParameterValues` to do that? There are zero open/closed issues in this GitHub repository complaining about `ConvertTo-SecureString` requiring `-Force` when it is used with `-AsPlainText`. Plus, when it comes to `$PSDefaultParameterValues`, by the time a user would apply a default value to change the way they invoke `ConvertTo-SecureString` when working with it interactively, they're likely knowledgeable enough that we should have no problem with them making that decision if they want to. I'm sure `-Force` might annoy a few people who don't want the reminder. I've spoken with others who appreciate the cmdlet drawing their attention to what they're doing.\r\n\r\n> @rkeithhill Until corefx provides a SensitiveString type to replace SecureString, we still need a type that doesn't implement `ToString()` and dump the contents accidentally to a transcript or the screen...\r\n\r\n...or into a file as a stored secret, or pull plain text from a file to use as a secret. `-Force` in these scenarios helps discourage such accidents.\r\n\r\nIMHO the change in behavior of `-Force` is out of scope for this PR, unjustified, and undesirable.\r\n",
