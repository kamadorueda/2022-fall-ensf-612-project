I went down every path I could find from the different comparison methods to cultural differences, to type conversion, but everything appears consistently implemented.\r\n\r\nAside from the questionable choice to hard-code case-sensitivity into `Select-Object -Unique` when [declaring the ObjectCommandComparer](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/530977440387eff029f36f20497c4a296ac01fda/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Select-Object.cs#L622), I couldn't find much.  \r\n\r\nI mean, that would explain why `\"derp\",\"Derp\" | Select-Object -unique` returns both values, but it doesn't explain why `[PSCustomObject]@{Name = \"derp\"},[PSCustomObject]@{Name = \"Derp\"} | Select-Object -unique` returns only a single value.
