    "body": "@iSazonov \r\n> A problem is that we should first build a crossgened release and then run tests with the build.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know AppVeyor does not support a similar concept to VSTS with Build and Release tasks where the Release (test) tasks use the artifact from the build. [Parallel testing](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/parallel-testing/) does not seem to have something in there that we could use for PowerShell tests.\r\nAll elements in the build matrix (XUnit, Unit and feature Pester tests) will need some sort of time spent on building as each matrix element is on a different VM, the advantage of parallelism would then only kick in when running the tests. If the XUnit tests need a special initialisation (different build parameters or initialisation, then we need to handle that as a test suite preparation step). Running the feature tests as a special category therefore comes 'for free' because the overall time will then be given by the longest running task. But the point is also to get different test result (and artifacts earlier). I don't know too much about the whole test suites but naively speaking I propose:\r\n- Building in Debug (without CrossGen) and running quick Pester unit tests to cover up `Debug.Assert` and race conditions and get accurate stack traces\r\n- Building in Release with CrossGen and running expensive Pester tests (Admin, JEA and possibly feature tests), depending on the duration, this can be split further\r\n- XUnit tests (with whatever build/initialisation option is required/recommended by the team)\r\n- Full Build (Release, CrossGen, etc.) that produces artifacts but also runs MSI smoke tests, etc.\r\n\r\nTo get an idea how it looks like and start small, we could try to first split only into 2 parts: Testing and ArtifactBuild\r\nIn general, depending on how it goes we could then run tests also in various configurations (Debug/Release, with/without CrossGen)\r\n\r\n@markekraus This should make it easier for first time contributors, because they know then more specifically what failed (e.g. was it a Pester tests, an XUnit test or did they break the MSI). Have a look at this PSSA run [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/PowerShell/psscriptanalyzer/build/1.0.2750) for example, where one can see that the tests passed on Windows PowerShell (5.1) but not PowerShell Core (Windows and Linux) and also not on WMF4.",
