    "body": "@iSazonov This is the only especially sensible method I can think of apart from the Get-Member test. Interestingly, `Compare-Object` does _not_ notice the difference; running that Compare-Object line (omitting the `Should`) gives no output. Appending `-IncludeEqual` indicates that it thinks both collections are equal and contain the same items.\r\n\r\nWhich is perfectly correct, I suppose, but it doesn't seem to distinguish the enumerated/not enumerated like one can by checking the type directly; indeed, it seems to me that this may be the only straightforward method to do so.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit of a tricky problem, and I acknowledge that there aren't a lot of good and easy ways to test it due to many cmdlets simply having an implicit *assumption* that piped objects will be enumerated and quietly handling those that don't, in an effort to make things like `$a | Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $b` and `Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $a -DifferenceObject $b` functionally equivalent.",

The example in the PR description doesn't have anything to do with Pester itself:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\r\n$a | Get-Member\r\nGet-Variable -Name a -ValueOnly | Get-Member\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese simply differ because with Get-Variable (and as far as I know, apart from `ConvertFrom-Json` where it is intentional due to JSON structure, it's the **only** cmdlet that does this) doesn't enumerate its output, so there's no difference between `gv -val a | gm` and `gm -inp (gv -val a)`\r\n\r\nThe initial Pester test that I used to verify the behaviour is this:\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Variable -Name var1 -ValueOnly | Should -Be $var1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd the reason this currently _fails_ is simply because `Should` is _expecting_ that a pipeline enumerates the output, so it **deliberately assumes** that any input that comes in implicitly has an already-discarded collection wrapper and matches things to the `-Be` provided parameter values accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe only way this breaks Pester itself would be if someone was using that exact test format and relying on the behaviour of `Get-Variable -ValueOnly` itself over the pipeline, which _may_ certainly be a concern, but to my knowledge Pester doesn't use that cmdlet specifically in this way, so it should remain unaffected. (Were I to need this, after all, I would opt instead for `Get-Variable` _without_ `-ValueOnly`, so that I could simply get the returned object and examine its `.Value` property, which is guaranteed to be true to life, pipeline or not.\r\n\r\nIf it did rely on that behaviour, I think I would expect the test to continue to fail once the change is made in the Get-Variable cmdlet, and we definitely saw the behaviour change as expected judging by the CI results and my own local tests.\r\n\r\nI will of course respect the committee's decision, but I just want to make sure we're not retaining inconsistent behaviour without giving it a thorough look-see. ðŸ˜„ ",

I think the overall conclusion from @PowerShell/powershell-committee is that we don't know how much impact there is with users relying on the current behavior.  A simple search on GItHub turned up a number of scripts using `Get-Variable -ValueOnly`, but it's not easy to see how many use this in a pipeline (directly or indirectly).  The Pester remark may have been incorrect, but wasn't the deciding factor.  It's also not clear how much value this provides (other than consistency) to justify the breaking change.",

There are a fair few alias-forms of the command and parameter that can be used, and in general I would expect less carefully-coded forms of the command to crop up more frequently in a search for those. For now I think we can probably leave it as-is -- but we absolutely should document this oddity. ðŸ˜„ ",
