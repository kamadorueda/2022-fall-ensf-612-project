    "body": "The cmdlet WG has thoroughly discussed this suggestion and came to this conclusion:\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a performance perspective, there is \"server\" and \"client\" side filtering. Currently, the way `Get-ChildItem` uses the API, filtering by age cannot be done \"server side\" in a way that we'd see performance benefits. So adding date and time filters would be for convenience reasons only. \r\n\r\n\r\nSince `Get-ChildItem` is a very generic cmdlet and does not work with just the filesystem provider but can also return completely different data, filter parameters would either need to be dynamic (applicable only when the filesystem provider is used), or require implementations for different providers and adjustments for the data they deliver.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis leads to a more generic challenge: date and time filtering may be a frequently requested operation, yet users may want to filter for modification, creation, or access, and they may want to do this using local time or UTC time, and they may want to filter based on various timespan units like hours or days. So providing adequate filters in a generic and descriptive way is complex and in the end may feel arbitrary.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneric client-side filter using `Where-Object` still seems to be the most flexible and descriptive approach. At the same time, `Where-Object` is fairly simple to use (works like SQL) while at the same time highly adjustable and self-descriptive:\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Path $env:windir -Filter *.log  -Recurse -ErrorAction Ignore | \r\n  Where-Object CreationTime -gt (Get-Date).AddHours(-12)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe cmdlet WG decided to close this issue for now. Should the API implementation of `Get-ChildItem` at some point allow substantial performance benefits using \"server side\" filtering, we are open to revisiting this idea.",
