Thank you for your contribution.\n\nBased on CI logs from appveyor, looks like you hit the problem that was discussed here https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/2182#discussion_r78429825\n\nMulti-line strings are not very reliable for testing, because they depend on OS and the way how test file itself was checkout (for instance on AppVeyor all line ends for git files are `\\n`, not `\\r\\n`).\n\nIn general, it's better to avoid using multi-line lines in the tests.\nThis case seems like an exception, where it's reasonable.\nYou can add code to strip-out line endings, similar to this:\n\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/platyPS/blob/32cc4b625348e40ce39dd12da352eabc203720f9/test/Pester/PlatyPs.Tests.ps1#L612\n\n```\n[-] Test ConvertTo-Html with no parameters 100ms\n   Expected string length 386 but was 396. Strings differ at index 110.\n   Expected: {<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"  \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\\n<head>\\n<title>HTML TABLE</title>\\n</head><body>\\n<table>\\n<colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup>\\n<tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th><th>Friends</th></tr>\\n<tr><td>John Doe</td><td>42</td><td>System.Object[]</td></tr>\\n</table>\\n</body></html>}\n   But was:  {<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN\"  \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd\">\\r\\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\\r\\n<head>\\r\\n<title>HTML TABLE</title>\\r\\n</head><body>\\r\\n<table>\\r\\n<colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup>\\r\\n<tr><th>Name</th><th>Age</th><th>Friends</th></tr>\\r\\n<tr><td>John Doe</td><td>42</td><td>System.Object[]</td></tr>\\r\\n</table>\\r\\n</body></html>}\n```\n",
