    "body": "As there is already a pull request #5760 for this issue, I'd like to add my thoughts with regards to this new feature.\r\n\r\nMany Web Services recommend that clients should implement a retry strategy to cope with intermittent failures of a web service, but also not to overload the service with too many subsequent requests (e.g. use Exponential Backof). But there are also other use cases for retries, where a client wants to regularly check if a Website comes online (retry until Status Code not 404), if a resource was modified (retry until Status Code not 304). Some responses may indicate, that the request rate should be reduced (e.g. AWS uses Status Code 503 \"Slow Down\"), which should be considered by a retry strategy.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, PowerShell should allow to configure different strategies for retries. The following are some of my thoughts and points taken from the discussion in PR #5760:\r\n\r\n- Parameter `-Retry` could indicate that the WebCmdlet should retry the request with a default, conservative, retry strategy\r\n- Parameter `-RetryCount` could indicate how many retries should be made\r\n- Parameter `-RetryIntervalSec` could indicate the interval between different request\r\n- Parameter `-RetryBackofStrategy` could indicate if `linear` or `exponential` backof strategy should be used\r\n- Parameter `-RetryStatusCodes` could contain a list of Status Codes for which the request is retried\r\n- Parameters could also be set on WebSession in PrepareSession() and then have this area of code retrieve the values from WebSession. It would mean extending WebRequestSession to include new Properties\r\n\r\nIn my opinion this is such an important feature, that it requires more discussion and an agreement on how it should be implemented, before work is continued on the PR.",
