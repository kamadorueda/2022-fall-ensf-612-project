The GAC probing logic should be put in AssemblyLoadContext and hook up with the `Resolving` event of the default loader. `Assembly.Load` will trigger the `Resolving` event if the default loader cannot resolve the assembly request. Implicit assembly loading is also taken care of by `Assembly.Load` in this way.",
