    "body": "`SecureString` was previously removed from .NET Core, so `System.Net.NetworkCredential` only takes plain string password in its constructors. Later, `SecureString` was added back to .NET Core RTM for both win and unix, but types like `System.Net.NetworkCredential` and `System.Diagnostics.Process` did not get updated to bring back the `SecureString` APIs. .NET Core is going to fix this in future release, and then we will move back to the `SecureString` APIs.\n\nAs for the comment in the code, you are right, it's not accurate. I will submit a PR to fix the comment.\n",
