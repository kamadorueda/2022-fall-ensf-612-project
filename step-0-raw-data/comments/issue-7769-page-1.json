    "body": "In the case where a file is not `executable`, PowerShell automatically does a `ShellExecute` (equivalent to explicitly calling `Invoke-Item`) which leaves it to the desktop shell to determine how to \"run\" the file.  If you try it with a .txt file, it should open notepad on Windows or textedit on macOS.  So this is expected.  In the case where there's no extension that makes it executable, it leaves it to the shell to take care of it.\r\n\r\nIn the case where you have `file` and `file.cmd`, it will make an exact match first so it finds `file` and not `file.cmd`.  So it does a `ShellExecute` on `file` and the shell seems to find `file.cmd` and executes that but to do so it needs to open a new console window.  You can see the same behavior with Win+R and give the absolute path to `echoFoo` (sans extension).\r\n\r\nThis all seems to be working as designed and (I think) only the edge case of having two files with same name differing by extension brings unintuitive results.",

So the behavior is different from what you described, correct?  I'm just trying to understand why the behavior is different for an absolute path, when it already does the correct thing for a relative path.\r\n\r\nThis will happen for anything installed via `npm`, the nodejs package manager.  `npm`'s installation mechanism always creates both a `.cmd` script and an extensionless bash script for every module that declares a binary.\r\n\r\nFor example, it affects TypeScript.  The example I cited in my original post is webpack, another popular tool.\r\n\r\n`npm` installs binaries into a project-local `.bin` directory so it's common to invoke binaries at this path.  And to avoid issues where I need to `cd` back to the root of my project, I use `$PSScriptRoot` to get the right path.  Here's an invocation that's affected by this issue:\r\n\r\n`& \"$PSScriptRoot\\node_modules\\.bin\\tsc\" # Compile TypeScript`\r\n\r\n(sorry if I sound repetitive; I'm just trying to ensure we're on the same page and that I'm not missing anything)",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT: @cspotcode has demonstrated that there's an inconsistency, and that its effects surface in a common use case.\r\n\r\n> When given a relative path, a search is used to find a match. However, when an absolute path is given, it's a literal.\r\n\r\nWhat search? The only way to resolve a relative path is relative to the current filesystem location; and a relative path such as `.\\.bin\\webpack` is a literal too.\r\n\r\nIn any event, there's no good reason to treat targeting a file by relative path differently than by absolute path.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhat makes sense _conceptually_:\r\n\r\n* Let _direct invocation_ / invocation via `&` (or even `.`) / `Start-Process` - typically used for _invoking executables_ -  _prioritize_ finding _executable_ files, which means that if no extension is specified, to start looking for files with one of the extensions in `$env:PATHEXT` _first_.\r\n\r\n   * `Start-Process` already does that with both relative and full paths.\r\n   * Direct invocation / `&` currently only does it for _relative_ paths, so we must fix it to do the same with absolute ones.\r\n\r\n* Let `Invoke-Item` - typically used for opening _documents_ - _prioritize_ finding extension-less files _as specified_, with a _fallback_ to looking for executables.\r\n\r\n  * This would technically be a breaking change from how `Invoke-Item` functions currently, but I doubt that someone relied on the old behavior, as it is mostly useless: Currently, it behaves like direct invocation does with absolute paths even with relative paths (so, unlike direct invocation, it is internally consistent, but arguably consistently does the wrong thing).\r\n   \r\nNow that we know that having `file` and `file.cmd` in the same folder _does_ happen in practice, and fairly commonly (`npm`), this separation would allow targeting either file in a predictable manner.\r\n\r\nI haven't looked into how to convince `ShellExecute` to treat a given file path _as-is_, without looking for variants with implied executable extensions, but I hope that's a solvable problem.\r\n",
