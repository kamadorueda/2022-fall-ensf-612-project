    "body": "My read of the linked issue and related issues/PRs seems to indicate that the _content_ of a custom payload is ignored, but the _size_ of the payload is still passed to the `ping` native util if running as root or with proper capabilities (permissions?) set on the calling process.\r\n\r\nSo I guess the question here is -- is this enough of a feature that we think it worth keeping for that (kinda narrow imo) use case, and wrap the error that comes up to tell the user to run pwsh as root if they want to use the relevant parameter? Or do we just compile this on Unix systems without that parameter entirely / ignore it if it's set?",
