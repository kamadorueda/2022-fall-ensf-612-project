    "body": "I believe this is not in place today because `subst` just creates the [DosDevice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/kernel/introduction-to-ms-dos-device-names) and because those devices are unique per session they are lost when you enter a new session. Mapped drives work in a similar fashion where they are just a `DosDevice` that maps the drive letter with the SMB provider but they also provide a functionality to persist across logon session through the `HKCU:\\Network` register key. This key is special because the Winlogon process knows to enumerate these values and create the `DosDevices` for that logons session. I'm not aware of `subst` offering that ability and anything that does just rely on autorun features like the `Run` key in the registry to run the `subst` command manually.\r\n\r\nPotentially it could add an entry into `HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\DOS Devices` which should work across reboots but this has some limitations to be aware off\r\n\r\n* It affects all users on the system, unlike persisted mapped drives which are just for the current user (logon session)\r\n* You have to be an admin as the key is in `HKLM` not `HKCU`",
