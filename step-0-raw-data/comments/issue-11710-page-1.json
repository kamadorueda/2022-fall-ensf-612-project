How does this cmdlet even begin to know which log files, are good to remove or which corporate videos get nuked for every organisation. \r\n\r\nI have 2TB collection of Grateful Dead live shows that has taken me over 35 years to accumulate. I would have negative thoughts were a cmdlet to delete that data.  And suppose that there were no 'temp' files to remove - what then? Would you expect the cmdlet to order, install, and provision a new disk, or a new computer with more disks etc etc? I jest of course but there are some real risks here.\r\n\r\nThe question of what constitutes deletable files is going to provide different answers for every customers. An Assert-Freespace might be useful - just leave it to the customer to catch the issue and deal accordingly.\r\n\r\n",

The approved verb system is for discoverability, and you aren't discovering internal functions in the same way  you do public functions (even as a new contributor).\r\n\r\nI say it makes sense mainly for internal functions because it doesn't seem productive to export a `Test`, `Set` *and also* an `Ensure` that just wraps the two.  It doesn't feel like saving an `if` statement is enough value to warrant exporting a whole extra command.  If you *really* want to add a \"test and fix\" option, I'd just add a `-Fix` switch to the `Test` command.\r\n\r\nThe verb also makes sense for external \"controller\" scripts, but I feel the same way there.  If the point of the script is to be ran from a scheduled task and not to provide utility to other scripts, there's nothing wrong with `EnsureDiskSpace.ps1`.",

More specifically, when I say internal I'm referring to situations where you would not (easily) be able to retrieve the function via `Get-Command -Verb Ensure`.\r\n\r\n> I'd say whether to use compliant naming there is a matter of personal preference.\r\n> \r\n> Especially If something is a proper advanced function - even if used only internally - I personally prefer compliant names. If you use nonstandard verbs, _PSSA will haunt you_, as @JohnLeyva has stated.\r\n\r\nI definitely agree that it's personal preference whether you'd like to *extend* the compliance guidline to include non-public commands. As for PSSA, yeah it's unfortunate that PSSA can't determine if a command is exported.  Personally I use `VerbNoun` naming in non-public commands mostly so it's easy to tell at a glance what is public and what isn't; not setting off PSSA is a plus as well.\r\n\r\n> (There's also the issue of something that may start out internal becoming public later; if you start out with compliant names, no refactoring is needed.)\r\n\r\nI get what you're saying but no refactoring seems unlikely.  I don't think the majority of folks build out an internal function in the same way they would a public one.  Plus in this scenario, this internal function is internal because you're just wrapping existing `Test` and `Set` commands to keep DRY.\r\n\r\n> There is currently no good solution:\r\n> \r\n> * You can either live with the annoyance of PSSA warnings that you know don't apply.\r\n> * Or you can turn PSSA verb warnings off altogether, and lose warnings you may care about.\r\n\r\nOr use a different naming scheme for non-public commands.  The list of approved verbs is pretty tailored to public API's imo.  I don't think it makes sense to try to shoe horn incredibly specific and narrow functions into the same naming conventions as general use API's, and I don't think it makes sense to expand the pool of verbs approved for public API's to include every verb you might want for internal commands.\r\n\r\n> (I suppose making the [`UseApprovedVerbs`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/master/RuleDocumentation/UseApprovedVerbs.md) configurable with exclusion lists would _technically_ be a solution, but I don't think encouraging \"private sub-languages\" is a good idea\r\n\r\nDefinitely agree there.  It would be really cool if PSSA could be expanded to infer what is exported and what isn't, but that's *pretty* difficult statically.\r\n",

    "body": "I see a lot of value in an `Ensure` verb. It covers this pattern:\r\n\r\n~~~powershell\r\nfunction Ensure-X {\r\n  if(-Not (Test-X)){\r\n    Set-X\r\n  }\r\n  if(-Not (Test-X)){\r\n    Set-YAndThenX\r\n  }\r\n  Assert-X\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf I call it once, actions are taken to give me my desired state. If I call it a second time the desired state is in place and no action needed.\r\n\r\nA solid example? `Ensure-CassandraClientDeployed`\r\n\r\nFor purity I cannot put it in \"New\" because that implies it is \"New\" meaning I now have two clients. I cannot put it in \"Set\" because it seems to suggest I am simply choosing which client is active.\r\n\r\nSo eveyone has to `Test-Pod cassandra-client` and if not `New-CassandraClient`. Can't even use `Deploy` because there is no `Undeploy`. With the advent of declarative approaches I would have liked to see this already added.",
