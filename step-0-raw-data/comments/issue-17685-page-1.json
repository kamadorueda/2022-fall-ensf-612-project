Is it at all likely that $HOME will be changed to $env:HOMEDRIVE$env:HOMEPATH in the near future, or ever?\r\n\r\nThere **are** two functions - IIRC profile was originally the home of NTUser.Dat - and is set for each user in the registry,    \r\nand the home directory was where users put personal files. The two are moved independently if  `net user tonys /profilepath:newDir` is combined with the `/homedir`  version everything is in one places otherwise you get the functions delivered from different directories.  \r\n\r\nWhen the two are different, whether ~ should be home or profile is arguable both ways but changing it will inevitably break things.   \r\nI did a scan for things that use $home and found that most of the use is combined with \\Documents (and in a few cases with \\Pictures) when the script should use `[System.Environment]::GetFolderPath()`. These scripts will fail when `Documents` etc are moved under `onedrive` for example (I have one machine set that way). \r\n Having $home as  `%HomeDrive%%HomeDir%`  instead of `%userProfile%` would mean these scripts have a chance of working when home <> profile.  \r\n So I can see that `$home` **MIGHT** be changed.  How likely or how soon ? That depends on persuading people that what it fixes is worth fixing and doing so has little chance of side effects. That probably needs a bigger scan of how it is used.   \r\n\r\n",

For everyone else it doesn't matter if $home is set homedrive\\homepath, or userprofile. It's been the latter (wrongly) for ever.  For the few affected something will be fixed if it is changed. But $home isn't used by many things, and where it is used it's not reliable. The advice really should be not to rely on $home but where things do, life can be made better for a few people by changing. So can you provide a list of things that aren't working because $home is wrong ? Because if it's just an annoyance that an unused variable has the wrong value in some \"edge cases\" it's hard to see it getting attention. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n",

    "body": "I like the fact that all the software is on the \"C\" volume and it's easy to\nremove changes by restoring this volume, without affecting my personal\nfiles on the \"D\" volume.\nThe AppData folder in \"C:\\Users\\tonys\" contains application packages.\nThe registry hive files in \"C:\\Users\\tonys\" contain software configuration\nsettings.\nSo these programs and settings stay in sync with the operating system and\nthe other application software.\n\nWhen I reinstall Windows, I choose to completely replace the old system, so\neverything on the \"C\" volume is reset to a clean state.\nI have a PowerShell script that uses the \"KnownFolder\" programming\ninterface functions to change the folder paths of the relocated folders to\nthe appropriate \"D:\\Users\\tonys\" folders.\nI have never had any problems with this approach.\n\nFor years I have used a PowerShell profile script to set $HOME and the\ninitial working directory to my preferred location, so I don't have to hard\ncode values in the rest of my code.\nI will just carry on using this script.\n",

    "body": "As for the importance of `$HOME` and its if-the-current-location-is-a-file-system-location equivalent, `~`:\r\n\r\nIt's an invaluable, cross-platform way to refer to the current user's home directory, and, at least from what I can tell, frequently used - but it has inherent challenges:\r\n\r\nGiven the variable's name:\r\n\r\n* From a Windows-only perspective (which applies to  _Windows PowerShell_), it should always have been the equivalent of `%HOMEDRIVE%HOMEPATH%` (expressed in `cmd.exe` terms), not the value of `%USERPROFILE%`, which only _by default_ is the same as the former.\r\n  * The distinction between the two location is where _data_ (home) is stored  vs. where _configuration_ (profile) is stored.\r\n  * As an aside: Arguably, _Windows itself_ should provide a _single_ environment variable that reflects the value of `%HOMEDRIVE%HOMEPATH%`\r\n\r\n* On Unix-like platforms, there's no such distinction, and `$HOME` reliably refers to the user's home directory.\r\n\r\nGiven the _cross-platform_ nature of PowerShell Core, there is an inherent tension:\r\n\r\n* The _current_ definition of `$HOME` reliably refers to where _some_ applications - notably those with a Unix heritage or those designed with multi-platform support - store their _configuration_ information (e.g, `~/.dotnet`)\r\n\r\n* On Unix-like platforms, it also _reliably_ refers to where a user's data (documents) are stored, but on Windows it does so only _situationally_, depending on the host machine's configuration.\r\n\r\nIn short: To resolve this tension and to account for other platform differences , true _platform-agnostic abstractions_ are needed - see #6966\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
