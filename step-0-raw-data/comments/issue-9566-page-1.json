    "body": "Thanks for the clarification, @rjmholt, but note that _parameter_ is simply the name that POSIX-like shells give to _both_ arguments and variables - the former are _positional_ parameters (e.g, `$1`), the latter are _named_ parameters (e.g, `$var`), and the parameter expansion works equally with both.\r\n\r\nIn other words: your example _is_ an instance of _parameter expansion_, as are the features in the document you link to.\r\n\r\nTo help with fleshing out what features PowerShell may benefit from, here's the list (from http://mywiki.wooledge.org/BashGuide/Parameters#Parameter_Expansion):\r\n\r\nSyntax | Description\r\n-- | --\r\n${parameter:-word} | Use Default Value. If 'parameter' is unset or null, 'word' (which may be an expansion) is substituted. Otherwise, the value of 'parameter' is substituted.\r\n${parameter:=word} | Assign Default Value. If 'parameter' is unset or null, 'word' (which may be an expansion) is assigned to 'parameter'. The value of 'parameter' is then substituted.\r\n${parameter:+word} | Use Alternate Value. If 'parameter' is null or unset, nothing is substituted, otherwise 'word' (which may be an expansion) is substituted.\r\n${parameter:offset:length} | Substring Expansion. Expands to up to 'length' characters of 'parameter' starting at the character specified by 'offset' (0-indexed). If ':length' is omitted, go all the way to the end. If 'offset' is negative (use parentheses!), count backward from the end of 'parameter' instead of forward from the beginning. If 'parameter' is @ or an indexed array name subscripted by @ or *, the result is 'length' positional parameters or members of the array, respectively, starting from 'offset'.\r\n${#parameter} | The length in characters of the value of 'parameter' is substituted. If 'parameter' is an array name subscripted by @ or *, return the number of elements.\r\n${parameter#pattern} | The 'pattern' is matched against the beginning of 'parameter'. The result is the expanded value of 'parameter' with the shortest match deleted. If 'parameter' is an array name subscripted by @ or *, this will be done on each element. Same for all following items.\r\n${parameter##pattern} | As above, but the longest match is deleted.\r\n${parameter%pattern} | The 'pattern' is matched against the end of 'parameter'. The result is the expanded value of 'parameter' with the shortest match deleted.\r\n${parameter%%pattern} | As above, but the longest match is deleted.\r\n${parameter/pat/string} | Results in the expanded value of 'parameter' with the first (unanchored) match of 'pat' replaced by 'string'. Assume null string when the '/string' part is absent.\r\n${parameter//pat/string} | As above, but every match of 'pat' is replaced.\r\n${parameter/#pat/string} | As above, but matched against the beginning. Useful for adding a common prefix with a null pattern: \"${array[@]/#/prefix}\".\r\n${parameter/%pat/string} | As above, but matched against the end. Useful for adding a common suffix with a null pattern.\r\n\r\nA few thoughts:\r\n\r\n* I think we can ignore `${#parameter}`, given that `$var.Length` can be used on string variables (and arrays, though it's better to use `.Count` for collections).\r\n\r\n* The `${parameter:-word}`, `${parameter:=word}` and `${parameter:+word}` features could conceivably be covered by ternary conditionals and null-conditional operators - see #3239 and #3240 \r\n\r\n* `${parameter//pat/string}` is covered by `-replace`, but variant `${parameter/pat/string}`, which replaces only the _first_ occurrence, has no counterpart.\r\n  * While `-replace` offers more flexibility through use of regexes, _literal_ use is currently cumbersome (`[regex]::Escape()`), so we could think about either a new operator or a syntax for verbatim regexes / wildcard patterns; related discussion: #9308\r\n\r\n* Arguably, `-replace` also has the various prefix (`#`) and suffix (`%`) stripping/substitution features covered.\r\n\r\n* That leaves us with `${parameter:offset:length}` for positional _substring_ extraction, which would be nice to have.\r\n  * For _arrays_, the existing `[...]` syntax is already pretty flexible, though there's room for improvement - see #7940 and #7928\r\n  * With the above indexing improvements, we could consider borrowing the array indexing syntax along the lines of: \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$var = 'abcde'\r\n# Wishful thinking\r\n${var[1..]} # -> 'bcde'; equivalent of: ${var:1}\r\n${var[1:2]} # -> 'bc'; equivalent of: ${var:1:2}\r\n${var[-2..]} # -> 'de'; equivalent of: ${var: -2}\r\n${var[1..@-1]} # -> 'bcd'; equivalent of: ${var:1:-1}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
