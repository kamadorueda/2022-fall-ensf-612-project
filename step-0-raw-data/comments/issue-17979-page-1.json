    "body": "Couple technical questions:\r\n\r\n1. What about non-Windows platforms? We would need to find good alternatives on Mac and Linux to ensure feature parity. It may turn out that the Windows dll means nothing if we have to reimplement it on other platforms anyways. Better to just grab any other sqlite nuget with right license and support. \r\n2. Do you want to implement it as `ConvertFrom-Sqlite` to take advantage of existing cmdlets which pretty much have SQL syntax like `Select-Object`, `Where-Object`, etc? Or build the selectors inside the cmdlet to take advantage of internal optimizations? Basically:\r\n    ```pwsh\r\n    Get-Content db.sqlite | ConvertFrom-Sqlite | Select-Object Name, Title | Where-Object { $_.Title -match 'Engineer' }\r\n    # or\r\n    Select-Sqlite -Select Name, Title -Where { $_.Title -match 'Engineer' }\r\n    ```\r\n3. As I mentioned, many cmdlets already provide SQL-like experience. The only one I found missing is `Join` which is provided by excellent [`Join-Object`](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Join/3.7.2). Perhaps we would like to speak to the author about making it standard? No idea how it would proceed, but there is probably some precedence for it, in C++ world fmtlib became part of stdlib in C++20.",

    "body": "@jhoneill That is a very good point. While useful for many people, I don't see SQLite as a must have builtin, as opposed to JSON and CSV. I would argue that YAML is a more common format that should be integrated into core PowerShell, but there is a decent Gallery module for it so I cannot really complain. Even for people who use SQLite on daily basis, I cannot see them being able to hold ground arguing \"I cannot believe it's not built in!\" as it's also not builtin into C# or Python, to name a few.\r\n\r\nWith so many SQLite modules already on Gallery, why bother writing a new one? And why even bother integrating one into core, if all you have to do is run `Install-Module`? Maybe the better way would be for PowerShell team to create a curated list of recommended modules, so you can run `Install-Module -Recommended SQLite` and it will pick the \"best\".",
