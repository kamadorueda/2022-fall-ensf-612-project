Let's say I have a powershell cmdlet with target framework of .NET Standard 2.0 (run-time dependent and not self-contained)\r\n1) Will it work with Windows powershell 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1?\r\n2) Will it work with Powershell core versions 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0?\r\n3) If I have powershell 3.0 installed which as per this link (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/windows-powershell-system-requirements?view=powershell-7) requires .NET framework 4, will my cmdlet work on it?\r\n4) Same condition as #3 question above but let's say if I externally install .NET framework 4.6.1 (or 4.7.x) from MSFT website on my machine, will it work with powershell 3.0 now? \r\n5) #4 question above is to understand that if it even matters what version of powershell I have to run my cmdlet. Does the only thing that matters is if I have a .NET Core or .Net Framework corresponding to .NET standard 2.0 installed on my client machine?\r\n\r\nPerhaps a table which has the following column with all combinations would help:\r\n(1) Cmdlet target framework, \r\n(2) Powershell version being used, \r\n(3) .NET framework or core version installed on the client\r\n(4) Will work or not\r\n\r\nThe issue seems closed.

    "body": "> Let's say I have a powershell cmdlet with target framework of .NET Standard 2.0 (run-time dependent and not self-contained)\r\n\r\nThe choice of run time dependent vs self contained is up to the host application, which in this case is PowerShell. This would only be your decision if you were running outside of PowerShell, or if you were hosting it.  I'm being a little pedantic here admittedly, but it can be an important distinction.\r\n\r\n> 1. Will it work with Windows powershell 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1?\r\n\r\nNot 2.0, that specifically requires a much older CLR version which is only supported by net framework 3.5 and below.  Everything else, depends on if netfx 4.7.1 (or 4.6.2 if you ship the shim) is installed on the target machine. That said the version of `PowerShellStandard.Library` built for 3.0 hasn't seen a lot of love (or adoption).  YMMV for anything under 5.1.\r\n\r\n> 2. Will it work with Powershell core versions 5.0, 6.0 and 7.0?\r\n\r\nDefinitely 6.0 and 7.0.  If by 5.0 you mean the version of PS core that was in nano I'm not sure, but probably not. iirc that had a really early build of .NET core which almost definitely wasn't netstandard2.0 compliant.  Is that still available through something? cc @SteveL-MSFT \r\n\r\n> 3. If I have powershell 3.0 installed which as per this link (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/windows-powershell-system-requirements?view=powershell-7) requires .NET framework 4, will my cmdlet work on it?\r\n> 4. Same condition as #3 question above but let's say if I externally install .NET framework 4.6.1 (or 4.7.x) from MSFT website on my machine, will it work with powershell 3.0 now?\r\n> 5. #4 question above is to understand that if it even matters what version of powershell I have to run my cmdlet. Does the only thing that matters is if I have a .NET Core or .Net Framework corresponding to .NET standard 2.0 installed on my client machine?\r\n\r\nSee response to `#1` for answers to above.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/windows-powershell-system-requirements\">Windows PowerShell System Requirements - PowerShell</a></strong></div></blockquote>",

    "body": "Thanks @SeeminglyScience That answers a bunch of my questions. While you have mentioned that answers to my other questions is same as what you mentioned in #1. \r\nI want an explicit answer to these ones:\r\n1) Powershell cmdlet targetted for .NET Standard 2.0 being run in Windows Powershell 5.0 (or 4.0) - will it work? I read your answer to this as YMMV but why is it YMMV is what I don't understand.\r\n2) Powershell cmdlet targetted for .NET Standard 2.0 being run in Windows Powershell 5.0 (or 4.0) and let's say I have .NET Framework 4.7.1 separately installed (I don't know if this scenario makes sense or is possible) - will it work?\r\nThe above questions only reinforce some confusion in my understanding about relation between Powershell version, Cmdlet target framework and .NET version installed on my client machine. Perhaps, a re-take on my 5th question above which I don't see an answer to or may be, I couldn't infer from your answers, might better help my understanding. Repeating again:\r\n5) if it even matters what version of powershell I am running my cmdlet on. Does the only thing that matters is if I have a .NET Core or .Net Framework corresponding to .NET standard 2.0 installed on my client machine? i.e. can I direct my host application for my cmdlet, Powershell in this case, to use any installed .Net Framework on my client machine?\r\nThanks for patiently answering all my questions and that too pretty fast.",
