    "body": "The code changes look fine.  I wouldn't mind seeing a bigger refactoring, but I'm happy to merge the changes as is.\n\nI would like to see at least one simple test.  Testing `Format-Table` is a little tricky, but it's straightforward to test the public api, e.g.\n\n``` powershell\n$host.UI.RawUI.LengthInBufferCells(\"$([char]0x1b)[0mabc\") | Should Be 3\n```\n\nWhen I add a new test, I just run the test script directly, that's usually good enough before pushing to let our CI run all the tests.\n",
