    "body": "The closest to what you want to achieve is `ScriptBlock.InvokeWithContext`, e.g.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n{ $_ }.InvokeWithContext(\r\n    @{},\r\n    [System.Collections.Generic.List[psvariable]][psvariable]::new('_', 'underBarValue'),\r\n    @())\r\n# underBarValue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat *does* create a new scope though, so it isn't perfect.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if there was a `useLocalScope` parameter on `InvokeWithContext`, or even an API closer to `DoInvokeReturnAsIs` where you could explicitly set `dollarUnder`, `scriptThis`, `args`, `input` and `useLocalScope` would be really useful. (`errorHandlingBehavior` is probably unnecessary for a public API though)",
