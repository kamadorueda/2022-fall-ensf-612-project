I believe that `-AssemblyName` should still search our `AssemblyLoadContext`'s `basePaths` (which should include `$PSHOME` as well as the folder of any imported module, and of course the current folder), so it (shouldn't) be \"useless\".\n\n/cc @daxian-dbw @vors \n",

    "body": "GAC is a FullCLR concept, not supported in .NET Core. `Add-Type -AssemblyName` should work with all .NET Core libraries that powershell depends on, which are known as Trusted Platform Assemblies. (TPAs). \nFor example:\n\n```\nPS F:\\> Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression -PassThru | ? IsPublic\n\nIsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType\n-------- -------- ----                                     --------\nTrue     False    ZipArchive                               System.Object\nTrue     False    ZipArchiveEntry                          System.Object\nTrue     True     ZipArchiveMode                           System.Enum\nTrue     True     CompressionLevel                         System.Enum\nTrue     True     CompressionMode                          System.Enum\nTrue     False    DeflateStream                            System.IO.Stream\nTrue     False    GZipStream                               System.IO.Stream\n```\n\nIt's not actually searching the local folder, but it happens that, as a standalone application,  powershell has all its dependencies in the same folder, so it looks like `Add-Type -AssemblyName` only searches for the local directory. On NanoServer/IoT, all .NET Core libraries are put in a centralized location, not the same directory where powershell resides, and `Add-Type -AssemblyName` will continue to work.\n",
