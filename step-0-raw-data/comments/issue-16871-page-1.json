If a field contains  a comma or a new line it needs to be wrapped in quotes, and if it contains quotes they need to be doubled up. \r\n\r\nIf the source file is generated by something which doesn't check for comma, newline or quotes in the data it needs to be pre-processed, although how you tell which new lines are \"end of row\" and which are not is a puzzle you will need to solve. \r\n\r\n**edit**\r\n>The newlines for those tools are in columns which contain XML data. They work fine in SQL Server Management Studio, but getting the data into Excel would help a lot.\r\n\r\nActually a regular expression to recognize a sequence of `<  >`  followed by a comma and put it in quote marks would probably fix it.  \r\n \r\n",
