    "body": "The key is in the original issue and its solution: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14413\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, the tools shipped as part of Git For Windows disable console VT mode. The PR added code that will reactivate it, but its trigger was implemented in `InputLoop.Run`.\r\n\r\nWhich fixes the issue for interactive prompt sessions, but not for script runs (which is how I found the issue originally). So if `patch` or `diff` is run as part of a script, there is no work for the `InputLoop` and VT mode stays deactivated for the remainder of the script's run.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/16612 fixes this to re-enable VT mode (if it was enabled before) in `NotifyEndApplication`, which should run after `patch` or `diff` have finished and before any other Cmdlets or other commands are run within the script (e.g. in my case `Write-Verbose`).\r\n\r\nEDIT: It _is_ interesting, as @jhoneill mentioned, that the issue persists in my tests - the async execution means that VT is disabled in the background while the prompt is active, but browsing through the command history with `key up`/`key down` doesn't seem to trigger the implementation in the `InputLoop` even though keyboard input happens.",
