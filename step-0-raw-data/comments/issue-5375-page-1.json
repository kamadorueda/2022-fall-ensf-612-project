In other words, the variables are captured at the call site of the function using `[Closure()]` _not_ the definition site of the scriptblock.  The latter is the way scope seems to work for scriptblocks invoked using `ForEach-Object`.  The way `ForEach-Object` works seems intuitive to me.  If nothing else, `ForEach-Object`'s scope rules are familiar to other PowerShell users.",

    "body": ">Exposing SessionState worries me. For a long time (since it was introduced in V2 for modules) I've felt that it gets in the way of implementing real closures and multi-threading.\r\n\r\nI prefer a future with better language support for multi-threading.\r\n\r\n> Imagine we always created a closure - with the understanding that certain things can't be captured (e.g. calls to Get-Variable) - that seems like it would solve a lot of problems, right?\r\n\r\nDo you mean that it would be as though every scriptblock definition implicitly called `.GetNewClosure()`.  So\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nNew-Module m {\r\n    $v = 'm value'\r\n    function n {\r\n        param($sb)\r\n        & $sb.Module { Get-Variable v -ValueOnly }\r\n    }\r\n} | Import-Module\r\n\r\n$v = 'outer value'\r\n\r\n& {\r\n    $v = 'definition-local value'\r\n    n -sb {} # .GetNewClosure() would be implicit\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould output `definition-local value`?",

    "body": "FWIW I settled on a combination of `$using:` and `.GetNewClosure()` to capture the value of variables from user-defined scriptblocks.  Calls to [`Save-WebFile`](https://github.com/alx9r/BootstraPS/blob/30bf72d6cd1605c3aaedf610374810262972c94f/BootstraPS.psm1#L1271-L1366) involving user variables in the certificate validation scriptblock look like this:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$githubCaName = 'GeoTrust*'\r\n\r\n#...\r\n\r\n'https://github.com/alx9r/BootstraPS/blob/master/LICENSE' |\r\n    Save-WebFile -Path c:\\temp\\LICENSE -CertificateValidator {\r\n        $_ | Assert-RootCaName $using:githubCaName\r\n    }.GetNewClosure()\r\n\r\n#...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis style is prone to forgetting `.GetNewClosure()` but that is mostly mitigated by `Save-WebFile` checking for the presence of `$githubCaName` in the closure.  It is also prone to forgetting `using` in the same manner as `Invoke-Command` and `Start-Job`.",
