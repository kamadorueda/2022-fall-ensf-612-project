    "body": "The 3rd case is exactly the scenario where this is needed, because it doesn't always work. For example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-Splat {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param(\r\n        [parameter(mandatory)]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $Name\r\n    )\r\n    $sb = {Get-Service @PSBoundParameters}\r\n    & $sb\r\n}\r\nTest-Splat -Name wuauserv\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you run that command, you'll get all services. Why? Because `$PSBoundParameters` variable is current scope only. So if you're using nested scopes or script blocks to reuse code within a function, and you want to splat in bound parameters, you cannot. You instead need to create an intermediate variable to store `$PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.BoundParameters` and then splat that variable, which is ironic given that I believe `$PSBoundParameters` was added to make parameter processing (and splatting of parameters) easier. I've had to use a temporary variable to achieve this many, many times in scripts and I continue to have to do it today. This is the most common scenario that drove me to add this to the language.\r\n\r\nAs a best practice, I don't use `$PSBoundParameters` in scripts because it is only accurate in the current scope, and I don't like minor refactoring risks to introduce unexpected issues so I use `$PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.BoundParameters` everywhere because it gives me consistency no matter where I use it, so I can refactor with confidence.\r\n\r\nHere is an example demonstrating what I would have to do instead if I wanted to make what I shared above work today:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-Splat {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param(\r\n        [parameter(mandatory)]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $Name\r\n    )\r\n    $sb = {\r\n        $cmdletParams = $PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.BoundParameters\r\n        Get-Service @cmdletParams\r\n    }\r\n    & $sb\r\n}\r\nTest-Splat -Name wuauserv\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe use of intermediate variables here feels unnecessary and it's just extra code to maintain. I want to be able to accomplish the same like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-Splat {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param(\r\n        [parameter(mandatory)]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $Name\r\n    )\r\n    $sb = {\r\n        Get-Service @PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.BoundParameters\r\n    }\r\n    & $sb\r\n}\r\nTest-Splat -Name wuauserv\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe other scenarios are added because it makes much more sense to me syntactically to be able to use the new syntax, which is very clear in intent, than to add an overly complex splat-subexpression syntax such as `@$($PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.BoundParameters)` to the language, as was suggested in the RFC.\r\n\r\nFurther, and quite important (so make sure you read/get this), these changes open the door for something else that is needed with splatting. One thing missing from splatting is the ability to perform a partial hashtable splat. Splat in one or more parameters, and only if they are present as keys in the hashtable. Splat in all parameters in the hashtable except for one or more parameters. Those scenarios (manipulating hashtables to get a subset hashtable easily without having to write complicated code) have benefits that extend beyond splatting and are useful elsewhere in scripts. By extending the splatting syntax to support member invocation and indices, we're opening the door for hashtable manipulation to be added independently of splatting, as it should be, such that splatting can just support it once it is added (maybe for free, maybe with a minor addition, depending on the syntax used for hashtable manipulation). If this is not clear, let me know and I'll go into more detail.\r\n\r\nThis need, and the justification for the syntax shared here, is crystal clear to me, keeping splatting focused on exactly what it was designed to do (take an array or a hashtable and splat those values into an invocation), while leveraging other current functionality (accessing members, accessing an indexed item) and new functionality (hashtable manipulation) using the same syntax that you would use elsewhere.\r\n\r\nPowerShell is object-oriented, with properties and methods, as well as indexable collections. When working with variables, we can access properties and methods and indexed items in collections with ease. Why should we have to use a different syntax to do so when splatting, or inject intermediate variables, when we can simply change a `$` before a variable name to a `@` and as a result be able to splat whatever that would return, in a more natural syntax that we're already familiar with, without having to use subexpressions where subexpressions are normally not required?\r\n\r\nFor some reason, when it comes to splatting improvements such as inline splatting and subexpression splatting and the discussions surrounding it, there seems to be a strong bias for new, obtuse syntax over syntax that maintains consistency with how things have already been written and used in PowerShell since v1, and I just don't get why. At any rate, I'll keep pushing improvements into the language the way I see them being most consistent and a best fit for what's already there, and this PR is an example of just that.",

    "body": "Funny enough, I ran into this just the other day.\r\n\r\nWith the WinSCP PSModule there are parameters for HostName, Port, SshPrivateKeyPath, etc. They all match perfectly for Splatting. However, when you have multiple servers, you have to namespace them.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would do this:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$config = @{\r\n  QA = @{\r\n    Host = @{\r\n      HostName = 'abc'\r\n      Port = 22\r\n    }\r\n  Prod = @{\r\n    Host = @{\r\n      HostName = 'abc'\r\n      Port = 22\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n\r\nNew-WinSCPOption @config.QA.Host\r\nNew-WinSCPOption @config.Prod.Host\r\n```\r\n\r\nToday, I would have to store both of those configurations into another variable first to use them:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$qaConfig = $config.QA.Host\r\n$prodConfig = $config.Prod.Host\r\n\r\nNew-WinSCPOption @qaConfig\r\nNew-WinSCPOption @prodConfig\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt just adds more work when I could have just splat directly to them.
