Since the current behavior (falling back to v2) is documented at various points in the code comments, it seemed to be an intentional design choice, maybe based on factors I wasn't aware of.  Honestly, this is the first pull request I've submitted, and I didn't want to overstep with a potentially significant change to how `Invoke-Command` connections work, so I went with a more conservative fix, but I'm not married to it.",

Is it possible the resource was just unavailable when the test was run?\r\n\r\nI'd also appreciate any suggestions on writing a Pester test for this issue.  I don't think any of the current remoting tests target a remote computer, so they don't offer much guidance.  So far I've been testing against computers available to me, but obviously that's too context-dependent to be of use to anyone else.  Are there any designated endpoints for this sort of testing?",
