    "body": "> According to the [`FormatMessage` API docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-formatmessage), the PDH error code values are of type `DWORD`, which the [marshalling docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/interop/marshaling-data-with-platform-invoke#platform-invoke-data-types) say should be rendered as `uint`. So this changes makes sense to me\r\n\r\nYeah.  The original author probably looked at `PdhMsg.h` and saw that the constants were suffixed with `L`.  Really easy mistake to make, it's not super intuitive that `long` translates to `Int32` and `long long` is what translates to `Int64`.  Especially since that's only Windows (see [64-bit data models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/64-bit_computing#64-bit_data_models)).",
