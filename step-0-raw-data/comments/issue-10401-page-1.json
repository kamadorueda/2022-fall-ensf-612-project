We always call the code with `Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()` or `System.IO.Path.GetDirectoryName(PsUtils.GetMainModule(currentProcess).FileName)` that is always a file system file in predictable form. _No other entry points exist_. So there is no unpredictable risk - we can review all code paths.\r\n\r\n> The performance impact is really too negligible for it to be worth the risk\r\n\r\nMy intention was and remains to go through all startup code and remove delays where possible. I would not be surprised if in the end we would get a 20-30 percent increase in performance. (Is startup scenario important?)\r\nAfter the PR we could optimize the code even more.\r\nWe call SetSessionStateDrive() 4 times at startup. We could call only 2 times.\r\nIn SetSessionStateDrive() we set current drive and then set location that do again set current drive.

    "body": "@daxian-dbw Thanks! Sorry if I noisy.\r\n\r\nIn the PR we do not do behavioral changes in the PR. \r\nSetSessionStateDrive() method code and comments say that we use _always_ and _exclusively_ FileSystem provider to set init drive and always set location to Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() if requested.\r\nIt seems the method name is misleading. Perhaps InitSessionStateDriveToFileSystemDrive() would be better.\r\nMoreover, this code is enclosed in try-catch and all exceptions is ignored. Even if something happens in the original code, we probably donâ€™t even see it too. We see only the consequences that is another current location than Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() but we have also another path for AppContainer which implies that no script should depend on this.\r\n\r\nThere are only two scenarios where we set a _folder_ location (that only the PR care).\r\nFirst, runspace creation scenario, we will see wrong prompt in console. Currently it works well.\r\nThen, we will have init file system location not in Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(). I set current drive to Temp:/ and create new runspace - this works well too. We could add the test. \r\nSecond, there is a runspace reset scenario. I can not found how could we test this but at first look it is the same as runspace creation scenario - in the sense that if creation works, then the reset works too.\r\n\r\nLast notice is that single scenario where set location is important is startup one because we want get right prompt. Remaining is not important because we use OS current path for initialization and it is not predictable and reliable source in multi runspace environment which means that nobody should lean on the value and set needed location explicitly in current runspace.\r\n\r\nNow Ð¼y only concern is with AppContainer scenario, which is mentioned in the comments. I do not understand how this can happen and how debug it. It looks like Directory.GetCurrentDirectory() returns nonexistent value in AppContainer.\r\nUpdate: I run the PR build in Windows container and pwsh is started with right prompt. Not tested for Linux container. Perhaps there was an issue with .Net Core 1.0?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
