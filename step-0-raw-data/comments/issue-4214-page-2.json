It's not a completely serious discussion and nothing is ever going to be an official pronunciation since its an unpronounceable word (no disrespect intended to team-`push`). but it has merit that maybe a popular contender will win out and we will start hearing it in presentations.",

I thought this would require an RFC at first, but I can see how this may not apply. Next, I'm looking at the policy on breaking changes (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md). Can y'all comment on which bucket this change fell into, and so on? \r\n\r\nNot trying to stir up something that's clearly settled, I just want to be able to communicate effectively to others interested who don't go reading specs and issues.

Since the code will need to be touched anyway, the batch can be switched to `pwsh.exe` from `powershell.exe`. If they are not porting PowerShell Core, then nothing will break and the scripts will continue to run with `powershell.exe` using Windows PowerShell.",

    "body": "I'm trying to understand the outrage and failing. \r\n\r\nPeople are complaining that the new name is breaking things, but, PowerShell Core is still in beta. IMO, if someone is using a beta tech in production code they are inviting disaster (I'm using polite language here). The nature of alpha and beta releases is that of being filled with breaking changes. There is no illusion that this is not beta. beta is baked into the version name: `6.0.0-beta.9`.\r\n\r\nThis name change has no effect on Windows PowerShell. It should not be breaking anything you are currently doing in Windows. If you are doing things in Linux, then you need to own up to the fact that you are using a beta version, instead of blaming the beta version for being a beta version. Consider using something else until the stable release is RTM if you cannot handle the breaking changes between beta releases.\r\n\r\nI get that people don't like the name. You can't always get what you want. I personally have hated PowerShell.exe because it is long and awkward to type. `pwsh` is at least less characters for me to mess up. If you look at the discussion thread you can see that multiple options were discussed some of them way worse (IMO) than `pwsh`.\r\n\r\nPeople misunderstand this as some awkward attempt to blend in with the cool Linux kids, when one of the primary motivators for a new binary name is Windows related. Yes, a linux-y name was chosen, but guess what? PowerShell is now a *nix citizen too. I think it's time people get used to that fact. One of the goals of Core is cross-platform portability, So yes, decisions can and will be made with more than Windows in mind.\r\n\r\nso that's my 2 cents worth.",

    "body": "@WernerMairl There is an open discussion about using 1.0 instead of 6.0.0 #5165. Please go to that thread and read and comment.\r\n\r\nAlso, since you have been using it and have run into things you think need polishing, please check open issues to see if they address what you have run into. If there is an open issue, vote on it or comment  and if not please open a new issue so they can be fixed. Several of us community members are actively engaged in fixing the lower priority issues and the Microsoft Team has been doing an amazing job working the higher priority and more difficult issues. Also, it's never too late to become a contributor yourself!\r\n\r\nOn the issue description and change communication, I agree that there was room for improvement on the communication of this change and why it was necessary. The roles of different people in this repo can be a bit confusing, but I am not a part of the PowerShell team, just a community contributor with (essentially) forum moderation privileges. I can't speak for the PowerShell Team, but I suspect they understand this fact themselves. \r\n\r\nIn their defense, this one is kind of hard to communicate. The majority of complaints seem to stem from the lack of understanding of the similarities and differences between Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core. In order to effectively communicate this change, they would have needed to also rehash what was spelled out in the [July 14th blog article](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2017/07/14/powershell-6-0-roadmap-coreclr-backwards-compatibility-and-more/). Which even then, people are still having difficulty navigating the similarity and differences. I think that it would need a lengthy description as to why the name change was done that many would still not read. I suspect the torches and pitchforks would have come no matter what.",

    "body": "I see some people still making the false assumption that the changing of the executable name was primarily to save on typing.  I can see how people may have gotten this impression since this original issue that was used for the PR started with a title asking for a shorter name.\r\n\r\nI agree that we can improve our communication as we shouldn't expect everyone to read all the comments that the Committee makes on decisions.  Particularly on a controversial one like this where the [summary](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4214#issuecomment-335989245) of the decision is easily lost.\r\n\r\nIt also seems that there is a fundamental misunderstanding of what PowerShell Core 6 is, particularly in relation to Windows PowerShell.  Windows PowerShell 5.1 is still and will be the in-box version of PowerShell on Windows.  My team also continues to support it as needed.  We fully expect customers to continue to rely on Windows PowerShell for as long as they need to which may very well be at least the next 10 years.  I think it was only recently when the downloads of WMF5.1 finally surpassed the downloads of WMF4.0.\r\n\r\nPowerShell Core 6 is the next evolution of PowerShell where it is not only cross platform but also Open Source.  As @markekraus noted, it is a major version change which allowed us more flexibility on accepting breaking changes we would never consider for Windows PowerShell.  Also noted that PowerShell Core 6 is explicitly designed to work side-by-side (not only with Windows PowerShell but other versions of PSCore6).  There should be no ambiguity of what you get on Windows when you type `powershell`.  I'll just note here that the 6.0 vs 1.0 discussion already happened a long time back before we went public and is unlikely going to be reopened.",

The original \"Windows PowerShell\" that has shipped with Windows since Windows 7.  This is powershell.exe and does not run on anything but Windows.  It is built on the desktop version of the .NET Framework (Windows only).\r\n\r\nThen there is the cross-platform version of PowerShell built on .NET Core that started life as \"PowerShell Core\" but has recently been shortened to just \"PowerShell\".  It does not come with Windows atm.  But it runs on Linux, macOS and Windows. You have to install it separately.  This is pwsh.exe.   On Windows,  you will have both powershell.exe and pwsh.exe (if you install it) and they do behave a bit differently due to differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core.  There are folks still using powershell.exe where the move to pwsh.exe would break their scripts.  So we need both names.",

Locking *all* old issues is something that's been discussed before, but we have a few active old issues and personally it seems a bit heavy handed to me.
