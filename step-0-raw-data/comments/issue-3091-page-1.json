I mean, even `System` and `System.Net.Http` are compiled to _native_, but have you seen `System.Security.Cryptography`?\r\n\r\nThe other day I tried [AngleSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AngleSharp).

    "body": "@Jaykul Another option is to do what PSReadLine does which is to build for `net472` only and test on PSCore6, and ship just that assembly (and dependent assemblies).  In this case, you wouldn't separately build for `netstandard2.0`.\r\n\r\nMSIL is compatible between .Net Framework and .Net Core.  .Net Standard really only provides some assurance that the APIs you're using are compatible in multiple CLRs.  If you test in both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core, you could get away with just building for `net472`.  There are exceptions, of course, if you start using assemblies that we don't include with PSCore6.\r\n\r\nI tested a build of your module against `net472` (modifying the psd1) on both 5.1 and 6.2-preview.1 and works in both (well, only tried Get and Set)",
