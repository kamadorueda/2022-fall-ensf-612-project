I have tried the installer on openSUSE Leap 15 (as 42.3 is reaching EOL in July) where I have not been able to get it to work. However, when trying to run the script which is currently on master I couldn't get it to work either. This problem is twofold, as the OS is not recognized by the main script and the openSUSE installer which is currently provided contains invalid bash. Unfortunately I am not familiar with openSUSE and would need some time to figure out why it currently is not recognized by the script on master and find a robust solution to recognize the operating system.",

    "body": "I don't know the root cause, but I let this slip through without realizing the distro fingerprinting had been altered to DEPEND on the parent script being called for each distro specific script.  I had specifically designed it to not depend - the parent script was a convenience when wanting to target distros homogenously.\r\n\r\nBut then I wanted to get off using my original merge branch for linuxmint support which still works for Amazon Linux - and this one does not. (I use it here to create Amazon LInux 2 containers that have PowerShell: https://gitlab.com/DarwinJS/amazon-linux-2-container-with-powershell/blob/master/Dockerfile#L4)\r\n\r\nSo this all points to the changes not being comprehensively tested - something I was doing whenever I made broad-based changes.\r\n\r\nSince these changes seemed to be mainly making the code prettier - not more functional - I'd rather revert to a known working state that I had tested across all distros - than try to fix and retest on all distros.  I really don't have the time for the latter.",

I have tried the installer on openSUSE Leap 15 (as 42.3 is reaching EOL in July) where I have not been able to get it to work. However, when trying to run the script which is currently on master I couldn't get it to work either. This problem is twofold, as the OS is not recognized by the main script and the openSUSE installer which is currently provided contains invalid bash. Unfortunately I am not familiar with openSUSE and would need some time to figure out why it currently is not recognized by the script on master and find a robust solution to recognize the operating system.\r\n\r\nOK, then maybe the solution is to consider Amazon Linux 2 a major distro and test and debug for it.  Not only is Amazon treating it this way, but it was the first distro to have prebuilt cloud image template (AMIs) from the cloud provider with .NET Core and PowerShell Core preinstalled.   That is a full Ec2 image, I want to use amazon linux 2 w/ PowerShell Core under Gitlab CI on Linux containers  - so still need installation support.",
