Whilst they could avoid the issue by returning the different result types as different properties on a custom object (i.e. thus keeping them clearly distinct in the pipeline, whilst allowing them to be formatted as required down the line), this kind of thing will catch out a lot of people who've not hit it previously.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful if the implicit `Format-Table` were able to check the pipeline values' `.PSObject.TypeNames` values and where they differ from the previous object, start a new table.  That said, this suggestion would be:\r\n- a breaking chage\r\n- wouldn't resolve the issue in the many cases where all values were `PSCustomObject`s.\r\n\r\nHowever, some solution along those lines would be helpful... Though I suspect it would be an enhancement rather than a bug...\r\n\r\n",
