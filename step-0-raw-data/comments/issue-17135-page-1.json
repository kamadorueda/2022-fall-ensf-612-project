If it applied to built in cmdlets that would break existing Proxy functions.  For example Octopus deploy redefines `Write-Verbose` to capture verbose output to its own log.  `Write-verbose` is one of PowerShell's modules which is signed, so if this was a blanket block, octopus would fail\r\n3. You would also need to prevent an alias being defined with the name of the function you want to protect. \r\n4. With a compiled cmdlet or executable file (including a .ps1) you can ensure the command that you run has not been subverted  by specifying its full path.  e.g. `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\\Write-Verbose \"boo\" -Verbose`  this defeats aliases or proxy functions or a file higher up the search path running instead of the one you intended, but not redefining a function over the top of an existing one or creating an alias for a trusted function. \r\n5. To be used in an attack the function re-definition needs run between loading the legitimate function and running it. If you could do that, would you not just run the code which does the malicious thing, not set it as a function to be run if the  user runs some command later. ?    \r\n6. When you're loading something where nothing else can be  allowed to sneak in (JEA scenarios being one) a combination of command visibility and using `$ExecutionContext.SessionState to change the language mode and the apps and scripts that can run generally does the job \r\nIn this case I would make \r\n```\r\n$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode = [System.Management.Automation.PSLanguageMode]::RestrictedLanguage\r\n```\r\nThe last line of the file. \r\n \r\n\r\n ",

To prevent this happening you can replace your calls to \"Write-Verbose\" with `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\\Write-Verbose`  now it always runs the command in the module not my code. In the same way if I know you run \"Batchprocess.ps1\",  and I can get my version of \"BatchProcess.ps1\" earlier in the path you'll run my code unless you run \"fully\\qualified\\path\\to\\BatchProcess.ps1\"\r\n\r\n(5) Doesn't stand up.  If something is hijacking another command by creating a function or alias  which runs when a trusted script runs - that Hijack has to get in between PowerShell starting and the script running.  Just putting a Get-Variable.exe on the path won't replace the cmdlet in a trusted script.  If you can  run arbitrary code in the session where the script is going to run, why not just run your malicious code - going to the trouble of putting it into a function is just an extra complication. \r\n\r\n\r\n ",

Changing what a command name does is a fundamental feature of PowerShell - whether that is the `sort` alias replacing `sort.com` on Windows, or a proxy function changing the `Add-ADGroupMember`  in a JEA environment to reject certain groups, or a custom profile adding recurse to `Select-String.`   The benefits are substantial and it has been used for a long time so even if that could be changed it would be undesirable to do so. \r\n2.  Like many things (including PowerShell itself)  attackers can abuse this feature.  If they are in a position to do so, they are already able to do malicious things (change trusted code, run arbitrary code in a user's session) and the _focus_ should be on preventing them having that access, mitigations if they do have that access are _secondary_ . I probably sound like _secondary_ equates to not worth bothering with :-)  Modifying a profile is just one case of this. I'll comment to the other issue on that.\r\n3. There are multiple reasons for wanting to ensure that a specific version of a command is run. For example I want to ensure that my Proxy functions for JEA are being called not the unrestricted cmdlets, or I want to ensure that version X of a module is loaded which implements a feature, and security There isn't a one size fits all for this - but trusted code should be signed, and specifying that a script requires commands to have signatures that meet some criteria looks like a possible solution.\r\n",

The fact that the source script is signed was never meant to provide the kinds of guarantees your appear to be expecting\r\n\r\nIt is any easy mistake to assume that if you have signed a script then if the signature says the script is unchanged then what runs is the same every time the script runs. How can something unchanged run different code?  Many ways, as it turns out. \r\n\r\nOne can create what looks like a new version of the module which contains some commonly called cmdlet... \r\n \r\nUnless the script is run in a clean session with -noprofile, and explicitly imports the modules it uses, first checking their signatures (I'll target `Get-AuthenticodeSignature` ) and verifies that every alias, function, cmdlet or external file called is the expected one (i.e. Get-Widget is a cmdlet in the verified Widget module) . The signature is just \"James was last to touch this part of a bigger whole, and this part hasn't been changed\" .\r\n\r\nI've signed my own scripts and put them into production (so if I went bad - who knows what was signed), and signed other peoples : in theory I reviewed before signing, but who knows what I might have added because I don't think people checked the code was as they gave it to me. When an organization signs its scripts the value of the signature depends on the process around it. ",

    "body": "As @IISResetMe points out, PowerShell script signing execution policies are intended only to validate script file contents.  In addition, PowerShell execution policies are not a security boundary as they can be easily bypassed, and instead are a considered a convenience feature.\r\n\r\nWhat **is** a security boundary is PowerShell running under system wide application control policies such as WDAC, where it runs in [constrained language mode](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-constrained-language-mode).\r\nApplication control policies are designed to protect against these kinds of dll, exe, scriptfile planting issues.\r\n\r\nMy only question here, for the @PowerShell/powershell-committee, is whether script functions should be able to override fully qualified module functions.  That seems wrong to me, but it may not be worth addressing since it will likely result in breaking behavior.  ",

    "body": "> Regardless if this is a security issue or not. This is still a reliability problem. If the script or module author cannot ensure the fully qualified cmdlet being called has the same behavior in dev as in production. This can and will cause unexpected behavior and the end user will blame the script or module author rather than the person who overloaded the cmdlets with a custom function or alias.\r\n\r\nIt should be exceedingly rare that someone would do this for a reason that is not explicitly for customization or mocking purposes. I don't think it's unreasonable for a module author to reply in this hypothetical that the scenario is not supported. Maybe someone would still be mad, but afaik this is all hypothetical and such a scenario has not occurred (*specifically* for a module qualified path, plenty of normal shadowing issues have occurred).\r\n\r\nThat said, even if we changed how command discovery of a module qualified invocation works, it could still be overridden by importing a module with the same name:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nNew-Module -Name 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility' -ScriptBlock {\r\n    function Add-Member {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Export-ModuleMember -Function Add-Member\r\n} | Import-Module\r\n\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Utility\\Add-Member\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey can even add a `$ExecutionContext.SessionState.InvokeCommand.PreCommandLookupAction` if they really want to. Or use modding tools like harmony to alter engine code at runtime. These things can be prevented with security tools, but from a module author perspective there has to be some acceptance that there are some scenarios you can't support or account for.\r\n",
