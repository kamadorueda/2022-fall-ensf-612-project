Do you have instructions to get windows to use SSH? I will try searching again, but i suspect that this may be a problem for a number due to lack of proper documentation.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance,\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: limiting to docs.microsoft.com for the search i found: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core?view=powershell-7\r\n\r\nfor some reason i didnt find this previous to today",
