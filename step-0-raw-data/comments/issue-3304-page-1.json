    "body": "Good evening Steve,\r\nThank you very much for your answer and help!, yes, I've noted that it is by design. \r\n\r\nBut this shouldn't be a reason to not enhance Powershell and wipe out bad design decisions.\r\nEvery programming language is great - if it operates as the programmer expect. If it doesn't, it should be fixed.\r\n\r\nI even think it's much more important for the most used commands, because they annoy every day.\r\n(In this example, we can not just add _-Include *.jpg_ to an existing command to get what we expect)\r\n\r\nI know it's always a problem if existing commands are changed in their old behaviour, but it can easily be solved by offering good release notes and a global switch, for example using\r\n`#Requires -Version xxx`\r\nor a new one:\r\n`#Uses-Command-Set -Version xxx`\r\n\r\nKind regards, Thomas",
