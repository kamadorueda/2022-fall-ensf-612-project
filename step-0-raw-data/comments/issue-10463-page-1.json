    "body": "I think PSMore is a longer term project that will take much longer to bring into use. Of course a complete revamp of the format system is desirable; however, I prefer to solve this problem now than make the community wait for a new formatting system to be implemented.\r\n\r\nThe changes proposed here are easier to implement now without mucking around with the complexities of the XML format system -- the format definitions themselves, and how they are rendered into the text we see in the console all stays the way it is now. These changes would be implemented natively in PowerShell from the start, and I don't think they get in the way of what PSMore is trying to accomplish, especially if the way they work is kept internal.\r\n\r\nAs for downlevel support, If necessary, I _believe_, but would need to confirm, the changes proposed here could be supported downlevel via an update to FormatPx. I strongly prefer not having FormatPx be the solution for current+future PowerShell though, because it needs to proxy certain core cmdlets for it to work, which means it can only be imported with `-Force`, and current solutions shouldn't have to take the extra dependency when this solution can just be implemented in-place in PowerShell today.",

It's something I learned while building FormatPx.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you wrote a function or a command to return information in errors that are stored in `$error`, with that information formatted a certain way, any ETS member you add will be on the error objects that are output _as well as_ the objects that are stored in `$error` (unless you explicitly copy those objects). This is undesirable -- you wouldn't want some errors stored in `$error` to format one way, and others to format another. That's what I want to avoid by having a `PSFormatObject` type. Returning a lightweight formatting wrapper allows me to preserve the existing members on an object while still being able to identify that it should be formatted a certain way when it is output.",
