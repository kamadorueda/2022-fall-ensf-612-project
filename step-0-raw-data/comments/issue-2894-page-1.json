    "body": "@joeyaiello this probably is Not a 'HighPriority' issue:\r\n\r\n- those are soft warnings, not errors; installation of the new version completes successfully;\r\n- each PS version is installed into a separate folder (e.g. \"/opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0-beta.3\" side-by-side with \"/opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0-alpha.18\");  link \"/usr/bin/powershell\" points to the last installed one.\r\n- looks like such dpkg warnings are a common issue when updating/removing some packages:\r\n\r\n> dpkg will not remove non-empty directories. If:\r\n> a directory was owned by some package, and \r\n> you added a file manually, or some package added a generated file, to that directory and then,\r\n> removed the first package,\r\n> dpkg will warn you that it is not removing that non-empty directory.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
