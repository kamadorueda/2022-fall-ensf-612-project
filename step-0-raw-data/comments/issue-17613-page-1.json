    "body": "I've made a fix for this. It's worth noting that this was actually working fine, as long as you provided at least one valid type to the catch block like: `try{}catch [System.DivideByZeroException] {$_.<Tab>}`\r\nMy fix simply adds a fallback to a standard ErrorRecord in case all the types were invalid.  \r\nThe type inference idea by Patrick for `$PSItem.Exception.<tab>` also seems to already have been implemented but I haven't checked if the completion code properly recognizes it, but I would assume it does.",
