    "body": "@mklement0 : the issue was not autogenerated. I was working on https://powershell.one/tricks/performance/group-object when I came across the bug and opened an issue here. After I posted the issue, later I realized that the bug affects Select-Object in general and not just -expandProperty. After updating the article, I returned here to update the issue but you already took care of it.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by \"it would help if the OP used proper code formatting\"? [EDITED: meanwhile I guess I figured out what you meant: adding markdown to format the code. That too would be an excellent bullet point for detailed instructions as suggested below. It's not ignorance but rather lack of routine to know about the required markdown or the editing commands.}\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I had a hard time finding a place to submit the issue in the first place. My natural first stop was at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell. In the section \"Developing and Contributing\", I eventually followed the link to the \"Contribution Guide\", then followed the steps outlined in \"Contributing to Issues\", and finally clicked \"open a new issue\".\r\n\r\nThis left me with a blank form w/o any instructions, so I did my best to describe the problem properly. I remember when I opened the issue https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10982, I followed a different link with a helpful issue template but was unable to find that link again anywhere.\r\n\r\nIMHO it would be helpful if the landing page https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell had a distinct section about feature requests and issue reporting, including the link to the issue template. This would help everyone and ensure reported issues are formatted correctly and contain all required information.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://powershell.one/tricks/performance/group-object\">Speeding Up Group-Object - powershell.one</a></strong></div><div>There is a design flaw in Group-Object.

Apparently, Select-Object priorizes the dynamically added props and \"forgets\" about the native hashtable props. This also explains the behavior with -ExpandProperty.\r\n",
