Acquiring a global lock, then setting the process pwd, then calling a method is a lot of overhead when the majority of .NET APIs don't depend on pwd. Doing this also greatly complicates a host application's (e.g. exchange UI, VMM console, etc.) use of the current working directory since it can't depend on PWD anymore. The workaround for .NET APIs that take paths is to, as mentioned in another comment, resolve the path before passing It to the API which need not be onerous e.g. `WriteAllText(\"$pwd\\fileincurrentdir.txt\")` ",
