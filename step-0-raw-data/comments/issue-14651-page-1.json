Any additional types we add automatically, increase the odds of a type name collision.  So, adding the requested namespace automatically would likely require a way to disable (not add) the namespace (automatically).  And there are also runtime costs associated with adding more types from more namespaces.  \r\n\r\nThe team feels that the current mechanism i.e., `using namespace <some.namespace>` is sufficient - providing a way to access the types that each individual scripter is interested in using without having to supply fully qualified type names.",
