Even benign errors break module dependency\r\n\r\nIf a module calls `Import-LocalizedData` _without suppressing the **inevitable** error_, that doesn't techincally stop the module from being imported and used. As a result, of _TWENTY THREE_ modules in $PSHome\\Modules which use Import-LocalizedData (on my Windows 10, PS5.1 system) **only two** use `-ErrorAction` to suppress the errors.  I don't know how many of these modules are actually localized, but if there's a betting pool, I'm taking ZERO.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem because if _another_ module or script specifies a dependency on any of these modules (e.g. via `RequiredModules` in the manifest or via `#requires -module` or just by calling `Import-Module -ErrorAction Stop` ... then those modules or scripts **break** whenever they are used in a locale that isn't explicitly localized.\r\n\r\nThe only reason I can think of that this hasn't come up before is that module authors basically never document their dependency on \"in the box\" modules, and nobody but Microsoft bothers to localize at all...\r\n\r\nIf I just use a cmdlet from a module with a localization problem, you'll see the localization error from the autoloading, but the cmdlet will run and produce results with no problems. It's only when I put the module in my RequiredModules or use a `#requires` that it causes a terminating error.",

    "body": "If you want my 2c on a better long-term design for Import-LocalizedData:\r\n\r\n#### Make a Import-LocalizedStringData which:\r\n1. Doesn't have a `SupportedCommand` parameter\r\n2. Expects the file to have *just* the content that ConvertFrom-StringData supports\r\n3. Guarantees the output is a `[dictionary[string,string]]` rather than a hashtable\r\n\r\nString dictionaries are clearly the main use case for localization, the other features of Import-LocalizedData aren't generally used for translation, and they make it more complicated to use for it's **primary** purpose: almost every use of Import-LocalizedData has an internal ConvertFrom-StringData which would be unnecessary with Import-LocalizedStringData.\r\n\r\n4. Requires a `DefaultData` string dictionary parameter\r\n5. Guarantees that the output will have a value for every string in the DefaultData parameter\r\n\r\nThis would ensure that the command never needs to produce an error -- it can fall back to the DefaultData -- it would also allow _partial_ localizations to use the default strings for untranslated content.\r\n\r\n6. Has a fallback folder for localizations that is user-editable (e.g. in AppData or ~\\.config)\r\n7. Respects a PreferenceVariable for whether or not to generate a language file in the user location is no localized data is found for the current culture\r\n\r\nThis would allow knowledgeable users to easily produce translations for themselves, without waiting for Microsoft to get around to supporting UK English 😉 ",

For now, I'm at the point where it's clearly problematic for us to add a dependency on any module that's localized.  \r\n\r\n## We currently work around the Archive module bug like this:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\nfunction DoNothing {}\r\nSet-Alias Import-LocalizedData DoNothing\r\nImport-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive\r\nRemove-Alias Import-LocalizedData\r\nRemove-Item function:DoNothing\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough we could, arguably, use `$PSDefaultParameterValues` to force en-US instead (which might work for some of these other modules) ...",
