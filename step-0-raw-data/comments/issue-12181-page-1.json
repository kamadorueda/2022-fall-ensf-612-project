    "body": "\r\n**First**, .NET Core runtime creates pipes for managed debugging, when the runtime starts up.\r\n> ... pipes for managed debugging in /tmp. They are named something like “clr-debug-pipe-17206-65823754-out”, “clr-debug-pipe-17206-65823754-in” where 17206 is the process id and 65823754 is the process creation time.\r\n\r\nYour screenshot shows the failure of creating the pipes. For details, see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/7204\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/77346070-dafb2900-6cf2-11ea-9323-9456538ab9a3.png)\r\n\r\nThis step can be disabled by executing `export COMPlus_EnableDiagnostics=0` before start the .NET Core program. See https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/15878 for details.\r\n\r\n**Second**, the update notification feature added in pwsh 7 requires writing to the disk. But you can disable it by executing `export POWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK=Off` before starting pwsh.\r\n\r\n**Third**, the `PSReadLine` saves command line history to a file. This can be disabled by running `Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing` right after starting pwsh I guess.\r\n\r\n**Fourth**, the module analysis in PowerShell saves the analysis results to a cache file. This cannot be disabled, but the failure of writing to the cache file will be tolerated by pwsh.\r\n\r\n**Fifth, ~this one might be a hard blocker.~** pwsh also creates a pipe for debugging purpose when starting (attach to a running pwsh process), and obviously, this will fail on a read-only file system. ~It's very possible this failure will terminate the process.~ Just got @PaulHigin's response on this: `PowerShell still runs if the named pipe cannot be created.  It just won't be able to use IPC.`\r\n\r\n### Given above, it's possible to run pwsh on a read-only file system, and you can try it out and share your observations.",
