It's likely will block the user input for a very noticeable period of time and the user simply cannot cancel whatever PowerShell is doing at that point. So, it seems PowerShell freezes, and the user has to wait till it becomes responsive.",

Thus, allowing autoload for external completers does not make this situation any worse.",

I highly doubt that MSFT will agree to run someone else's extra code! Mandatory signing of such files is not convenient for users.\r\n\r\nNow the .Net Command Line project uses the approach of starting target application with every tab. It is obvious how problematic this approach is.\r\n\r\nI would suggest joining forces with this project and developing a standard for declarative description of meta information about parameters and arguments.\r\nPowerShell uses this now through attributes. If there were a standard, it would be able to read external information (XML/Json) from any application and use it for completion.",
