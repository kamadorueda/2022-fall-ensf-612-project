For Powershell 5.1 to print emoji's that are hard coded into the text file e.g\r\n```powershell\r\necho \"Done ✅\"\r\n```\r\nyou have to save the file with `UTF8-BOM` encoding. For some reason it doesn't pick up on the UTF8 unless it has the BOM whereas newer versions of PowerShell automatically detect any UTF8.\r\n\r\nHope this helps someone with the same problem I had.",
