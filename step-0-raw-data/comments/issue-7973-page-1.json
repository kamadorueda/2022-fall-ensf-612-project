That's why I merge them into the files each time.\r\n\r\nHere is a summary of the changes I make:\r\n\r\nTableControl\r\n\tReduced LastWriteTime from 25 to 20 to allow some extra space for the next change\r\n\t\r\n\tIncreased Length from 14 to 15 to allow room for formatting the length to include commas\r\n\t\r\n\tModify LastWriteTime formatting to M/dd/yyyy and h:mm:tt so that date and times line up\r\n\tbetter and are easier to read\r\n\r\n\tModify Length formatting to {0:n0} so that it includes commas \r\n\t(I cannot believe PS has not made this change in all these years, even DOS had commas!)\r\n\r\nListControl\r\n\tModify Length formatting to {0:n0} so that it includes commas \r\n\r\n\tModify CreationTime   formatting to M/dd/yyyy and h:mm:tt so that date and times line up\r\n\t\t(NOTE: 2 places require changing)\r\n\tModify LastWriteTime  formatting to M/dd/yyyy and h:mm:tt so that date and times line up\r\n\t\t(NOTE: 2 places require changing)\r\n\tModify LastAccessTime formatting to M/dd/yyyy and h:mm:tt so that date and times line up\r\n\t\t(NOTE: 2 places require changing)\r\n\r\nThen I use the following in my profile to incorporate my changes into the PS session\t\r\n\r\n\tUpdate-FormatData -PrependPath My.FileSystem.format.ps1xml\r\n\r\nI am happy to send you my files if you are interested in including those changes.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
