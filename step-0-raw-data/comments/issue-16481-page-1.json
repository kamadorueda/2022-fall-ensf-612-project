I've commented to #14417  - that asked for something **optional**  -verbose:false would do the job when you know you're creating an API with sensitive info in it, not to break things for REST developers ... all teams make good and bad decisions, the powershell team has plenty in the \"good column\", but this ain't one. The change wants undoing, when I see complaints I'll point people to that proxy function. \r\n",
