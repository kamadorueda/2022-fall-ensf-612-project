    "body": "I've looked at taking up that issue once in the past, and the roadblock I hit was about the same the other folks who've looked at it that I spoke to have also hit.\r\n\r\nEssentially, it seems the bar has been set _far too high_ for a SemVer implementation in .NET Core / .NET 5. Everyone who sees that someone is asking for a concrete SemVer implementation seems to question it, and by far the most complex question is \"given a random SemVer, how do I tell what version of SemVer they're using?\"\r\n\r\nAnd there isn't really a clear answer to that one; it's not a problem SemVer is especially well-designed to be able to handle. There are several other implementation questions detailed in the CoreFX issue, as I recall, that have gone undecided / unresolved, and the .NET Core planning/PR process is much lengthier than many folks can reasonably undertake.\r\n\r\nAnd thus far it seems like the .NET Core team is content to wait until _everyone_ is happy with a given proposed specification before moving forward with SemVer, which... quite **literally**  by definition will never happen. Until .NET Core change their stance and at least allow a _first_ SemVer implementation in, there will never be one in .NET Core, and there will never be improvements made to one if they don't have a base to work with.",

This problem has to be solved in PowerShellGet by the time v3 goes stable.",
