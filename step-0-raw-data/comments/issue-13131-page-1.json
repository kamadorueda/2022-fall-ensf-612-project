We're waiting on a solution before we can ship another MSIX\r\n\r\nI hadn't looked hard at that issue, as I assumed it was due to the misupgrade issue in the v7.1.0-preview.4 release.\r\n\r\nProbably better to have mentioned this in the release notes though, so people know to switch from the MSIX to the MSI in the meantime.",
