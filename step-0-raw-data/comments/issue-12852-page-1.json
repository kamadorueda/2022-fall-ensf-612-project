    "body": "Well...I had this issue using  pwsh 7 on win11 to pwsh 7 on win11, but it's not caused by some prints or displays output in the profile script. \r\n\r\nFor some reason I changed my system default code page to utf-8 (chcp 65001). And every time I open my profile like `code $profile` , it will print `Active code page: 65001`, even if I do not have a profile script. \r\n\r\nAnd when I use `New-PsSession` to connect  , it fails with an error message: `There is an error processing data from the background process. Error reported: Active code page: 65001.` But ssh.exe is ok. \r\n\r\nSo\r\n> that profile script prints or displays output when run\r\n\r\nis not just some output in script , but some output when running / loading profile script.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, It happens while I do not change the default OpenSSH server's command shell.\r\n\r\n**edit:** Now I change the OpenSSH server's default shell to pwsh and connect with ssh.exe . It works well.\r\n\r\nThanks @veleek  and people in #https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1498 , for letting me know how it is caused.",
