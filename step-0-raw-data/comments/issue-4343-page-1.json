Being able to use `$foo -as [PSCustomObject]` successfully on hashtables would be a big boost in usability as it fits in a pipeline where the alternative form does not. It's also quite unintuitive that `[PSCustomObject]$foo` functions differently from `$foo -as [PSCustomObject]`, at least in where `$foo` is a hashtable.",

    "body": "> the surprising thing is that 1) some classes cannot convert to themselves and 2) PSCustomObject is one of those. Everything else about -as/as makes sense.\r\n\r\nAnd it is that very surprise that is my point (but I appreciate that you introduced me to the subtler points of `as`).\r\n\r\n>  making some silly exception for PSCustomObject would be ridiculous.\r\n\r\nI'm not advocating an _exception_; I'm advocating that `-as` honor one fundamental expectation: if the LHS of `-as` already _is_ of the RHS type - _whatever that type may be_ - pass it through - which is in fact what C# does, after all:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Obtain a [System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject] instance\r\n// and store it in a generic [System.Object] variable.\r\n// Note that the [System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject] cannot be instantiated\r\n// directly - no public constructors - and must instead be created indirectly, via a \r\n// [System.Management.Automation.PSObject] wrapper, whose `.BaseObject` property\r\n// contains the custom object.\r\nobject o = new PSObject().BaseObject;\r\n\r\n// OK: Casting back to [System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject] works.\r\nPSCustomObject co = (PSCustomObject) o;\r\n\r\n// OK with `as` too.\r\nPSCustomObject co_as = o as PSCustomObject;\t\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, if PowerShell tells me the following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $co = [pscustomobject] @{ one = 1 }; $co.GetType().FullName; $co -is [System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject]\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject\r\n$True\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat is, if it treats the object as a bona fide `[System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject]` instance in these contexts (which it should), then, of course, I'd expect \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$co -as [System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject]\r\n```\r\n\r\nto pass `$co` through.\r\n\r\n_Presumably_, the internal `[psobject]` wrapper gets in the way (I haven't looked).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Acts exactly the same as System.Object does with as in C#:\r\n\r\nExcept that every .NET type is indeed derived from `System.Object` - _unlike from `[psobject]`_.\r\n\r\nThe `[psobject]` wrapper is a _PS implementation detail_ and that it surfaces prominently in some places (see #5551 and #5579) is unfortunate.\r\n\r\nJust as `as System.Object` is pointless in C# (_anything_ is passed through), `-as [psobject]` is pointless in PowerShell - and behaves incorrectly to boot.\r\n\r\nThe  unfortunate identity of `[psobject]` and `[pscustomobject]` means that people _will_ try something like `$obj -as [pscustomobject]` - and will be surprised to find that it passes _anything_ through.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "FYI: PSCustomObject is essentially a \"typeless\" object - a PSObject whose base object is itself. It's used when you need properties but don't have or need a type. For example - `... | select-object -property foo,bar,baz` will extract the foo, bar and baz properties from the pipeline input object, then create a PSCustomObject and attach the extracted properties to that PSCustomObject. The resulting object has a fixed set of properties but it doesn't really have a type. You don't want to create a new concrete .NET type every time you run select-object, or import-json, or invoke a remote command or import CliXML, etc. So anywhere an object of no fixed type but with specific properties are needed, a PSCustomObject is used.",

    "body": "@BrucePay That much is clear to me. \r\n\r\nI think the crux of this particular issue is whether `-as` and `PSCustomObject` are acting as `by design`. I believe that they are. I believe it may be surprising and somewhat confusing to the average PowerShell user, even though it makes perfect sense when you understand it in depth. If it is `by design` then the question becomes whether we consider special casing it somehow.\r\n\r\nMy personal stance is that current behavior is `by design` and perfectly fine as is. But, it would great if someone with better understanding clarify that point. ",
