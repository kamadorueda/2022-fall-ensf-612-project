My original code example however didn't originally use the property names, instead iterating on the entire property requiring the longer `{$_.Name -cin (collection of strings)}`.\r\n\r\nAlso notice that single word simple string values do not need quotes if they are the argument of the condition, but they do when they are the operand of an operator.
