    "body": "I looked into this a bit.\r\n\r\nThe deserialized enum value is a `PSObject` whose `BaseObject` is the underlying value of the enum.  For instance `[DayOfWeek]::Friday` would be a `PSObject` wrapped around the `int` \"5\".  The `PSObject` wrapper has a field called `toStringFromDeserialization`, that value in this case holds the enum name \"Friday\".\r\n\r\nSince the deserialized object's `ToString()` returns 'Friday', I would expect that this would work.  However in the `PSToStringBinder`, if the target is a `PSObject` that is wrapping a real value (like `5`), then the `PSObject` is unwrapped and the binder is reran with the unwrapped value.\r\n\r\nThis is a problem not just with this specific case but any time an ETS member could affect the outcome of a binder.\r\n\r\nIdeally, ETS members would be considered in all binders.  However, one possible solution to fix this specific case would be to check for `toStringFromDeserialization` prior to `DeferToPSObject` is called.\r\n\r\nHere's the current code in `PSToStringBinder`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/096a78fbe3fa9997b1a4ab4e8f0014317ac1e3fe/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs#L1073-L1076\r\n\r\nThat could be changed to something like this: (untested)\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nif (target.Value is PSObject pso && (PSObject.Base(target.Value) != target.Value))\r\n{\r\n    if (pso.ToStringFromDeserialization != null)\r\n    {\r\n        // Should be in CachedReflectionInfo instead\r\n        var toStringFromDeserialization = typeof(PSObject).GetProperty(\r\n            nameof(PSObject.ToStringFromDeserialization),\r\n            BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic);\r\n\r\n        var toStringValue = Expression.Property(target.Expression, toStringFromDeserialization);\r\n\r\n        var bindingRules = BindingRestrictions.GetExpressionRestriction(\r\n            Expression.NotEqual(\r\n                toStringValue,\r\n                Expression.Constant(null, typeof(string))));\r\n\r\n        return new DynamicMetaObject(toStringValue, bindingRules).WriteToDebugLog(this);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return this.DeferForPSObject(target, args[0]).WriteToDebugLog(this);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally this would be fixed for all binders and for all ETS members, but this would be the least disruptive way to fix deserialized enums",

I admit there are problems on how to-string conversion is handled in PowerShell -- it lacks consistency. Not just the PSObject generated by deserialization, but also the `ToString` method that overrides the default `ToString` on the base object.\r\nExample:\r\n```powershell\r\n$a = 1\r\n$a | Add-Member -MemberType ScriptMethod -Name ToString -Value { \"Can you see me?\" } -Force\r\n$a\r\n> Can you see me?\r\n'Can you see me?' -eq $a\r\n> False\r\n\"{0}\" -f $a\r\n> 1\r\n$a, $a -join \";\"\r\n> Can you see me?;Can you see me?\r\n$a -match 'can'\r\n> False\r\n```\r\nThis looks to me a bigger problem cross the board ...\r\nAs for the fix proposed by @SeeminglyScience, it's not a general fix even thought it would address some of the issues related to the PSObject created by deserialization.\r\n\r\nBesides, by looking at the code, I think the proposed fix won't address what is specifically reported in this issue, namely `where status -eq 'Stop'` or `where { $_.Status -eq 'Stop' }`.",

This is by design. But it's not necessary that we shall do so for all binary operations (for string type RHS, it makes sense to try converting, but I'm not sure we should do it for other types).\r\n\r\nI figured it would work since `10 + '10'` returns 20.  Maybe that's an explicit exception but it feels like it should work to me 🤷‍♂ \r\n\r\n> > That makes this a bit more complicated...\r\n> \r\n> What makes it even more complicated is the fact that when `PSObject` is the target for a binding operation, [it will be unwrapped](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/MshObject.cs#L2179) before sending to the real binder.

Especially since this is the first I've seen this actually brought up.  Though I will admit, I've generally steered clear of ETS because it never felt consistent.  I'm starting to think a lot of that feeling of inconsistency is related, and a fix might go a long way to making it feel more solid.\r\n\r\nI'm still confident that it's worth fixing, sure does make me nervous though.",
