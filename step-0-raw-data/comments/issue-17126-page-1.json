OneGet/oneget serves a similar but also quite different purpose and is mostly in maintenance mode.",

I assumed that NuGet/OneGet was the chosen package management provider, and the project author publishes the powershell scripts as NuGet packages. I was just trying to use it as intended, in an automated way.",
