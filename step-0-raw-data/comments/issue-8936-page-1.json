    "body": "Hey @rjmholt, @iSazonov ðŸ˜„ , \r\n\r\nA potential refactoring I've been thinking about has to to with ``LoadModuleManifest`` method within ``ModuleCmdletBase.cs``\r\nThis method does essentially two things : \r\n- Checks the manifest file properties.\r\n- Loads the related modules included in the file.\r\n\r\nSince we already have a ``TestModuleManifest.cs`` which uses ``LoadModuleManifest`` + flag disabling all the imports it might be interesting to move the checks to ``TestModuleManifest.cs`` (something along the lines of ``CheckManifestProperties``) and have ``LoadModuleManifest`` call that method before carrying on with the imports.\r\n\r\nThis has the following benefits :  \r\n- Delegate module manifest checks to ``TestModuleManifest.cs`` so that the property checking can be \"owned\" by the file implementing the associated cmdlet.\r\n- Reduce ``ModuleCmdletBase.cs`` size by 25% making it more readable and relieving it of some of its responsibilities improving overall readability.\r\n\r\nThis has the following potential issues : \r\n- Module related cmdlets can have some subtle behavior and the current test base does not cover the cmdlets sufficiently to easily refactor without running a big risk of introducing unforeseen potential breaking changes.\r\n- ``LoadModuleManifest`` intertwines simple property checks with imports of related modules and therefore taking into account the previous point we could very well be introducting breaking changes by following through with that refactoring idea.\r\nCurrently the method does : ``TestSomeProperties => ImportModules => TestSomeMoreProperties``\r\nAnd I am thinking of : ``TestAllProperties => ImportModules``\r\n\r\nHere are the steps to get to where we'd like to go if this strategy gets a green light : \r\n- More tests for Remove-Module (very few tests exist for this one right now)\r\n- More tests for Import-Module\r\n- More tests for Test-ModuleManifest (This should be the one with the smallest risk of unexpected behavior)\r\n- More tests for Get-Module\r\n- Implement refactoring idea\r\n\r\nOne question I've had regarding the testing base in general is : \r\n- How do we know we have sufficient coverage regarding a cmdlet (especially since for example import-module can have subtle behavior so it's tough to test for that behavior without knowing about it) ?",
