    "body": "@JoeSalmeri I appreciate you sharing your extensions, but I feel I should point out a few reasons why they shouldn't be applied to PowerShell as the default format that ships with the product:\r\n\r\n1. The date format that PowerShell uses adheres to the international ISO8601 standard. Your proposed format is US-specific, and therefore only easier to read for someone in the United States. As someone not living in the US, I would vote strongly against the proposed date format.\r\n1. The number format that you proposed, to add commas to file lengths, which may be nice in a UI, but I'm not sure I agree with it in PowerShell output. I much prefer showing the value without any commas, so that regardless of what computer I'm working on and what culture it uses, I see the data in the same format (not all cultures use commas as their thousands separator).\r\n\r\nMy recommendation would be to leave the existing date/time/length formats as is, and if you want special formatting in your environment, use Update-FormatData.",

At this point, however, I would simply recommend that they provide adequate documentation with examples, but that would be in response to your original issue. For this issue, I would simply recommend you use Update-FormatData so that you can get the output that is meaningful to you (as you have been doing), and perhaps share it on a blog or in a module published on the PowerShell Gallery if you want to provide it as optional for others who want to opt-in to that experience as well.",

I cannot predict which future formatting changes I might make any more than MSFT could predict which formatting changes they might make :-)\r\n\r\nThat's why I went through the effort of re-applying my changes every time a new version of PS came out because I did not want to inadvertently lose some new formatting or features that MSFT included because my starting point for my changes was based on an older version of the format files.\r\n\r\nHere is a simple real world example that actually occurred at some point during of the PS releases.\r\n\r\nThe FileSystem.Format.ps1xml file changed the display of the \"Mode\" attribute to include a \"l\" at the end of the \"Mode\" attribute for a item which represented a \"link\".  \r\n\r\nIf I did not have the full source to the \"new\" format files (as is the case now since they are not included), then I would not have been aware of that change since my files were based on the older version.  \r\n\r\nSince the full source for the format files was provided at that time, when I started with the new version of the files and then applied my changes I did not lose any of the new features or changes that MSFT made.\r\n\r\nOver the years, there have been other changes to the files.\r\n\r\nHopefully my simple example explains why providing some examples of formatting would not be sufficient to address the original issue.\r\n\r\nI would be perfectly fine doing what I have done for all these years, I just need the source files when new versions come out.\r\n\r\nHope that makes sense!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@KirkMunro is correct that my ask is to submit changes @JoeSalmeri makes that he finds useful to see if the broader community found them useful and if so, it would make sense to include in the product.  Based on the discussion, thus far, it seems there is a concern that it is very en-US locale specific.  Given that analysis, it doesn't make sense to change the default formatter.  However, it may make sense to introduce a way to see dates/numbers in local culture, but need a proposal on how to handle this if there is sufficient user demand for it.\r\n\r\nRegarding the ps1xml, the default formatters were converted to C# code and thus the ps1xml is no longer used.  As @mklement0 pointed out, one can export the C# format code to a ps1xml file that one can customize so that seems like a fair solution.",

Regarding my comment, basically if a format requires enhancements made in 5.1 and 5.1 wasn't requested, then you wouldn't get that formatter.  This is to allow Windows PowerShell v2, v3, v4, and v5 to work against a Windows PowerShell 5.1+ remoting endpoint.  FileInfo and DirectoryInfo in 5.1+ has these enhancements.  So without specifying `-PowerShellVersion 5.1` (or higher), you get no format data (which results in default formatting).\r\n\r\nThe requirement of `-PowerShellVersion 5.1` is an unfortunate requirement currently.  Need someone to think through how to make this parameter compatible with remoting (backwards compatible), but not necessary when run locally.",

That item appears to be for something related to the PesterTests.\r\n\r\nIf you select the 2nd item (vs the 1st) and then click on Artifacts, that has the various install files and zip files that I was looking for.\r\n\r\nFrom there I downloaded PowerShell-6.2.0-preview.848-win-x64.zip.\r\n\r\nAfter unzipping that does indeed seem to be the what I was looking for and at first glance does appear to have the fix that @SteveL-MSFT and I have been discussing.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for chiming in!  Although TestPackage.zip did not contain the build you helped me find the correct location.\r\n\r\nFYI, I think the build was not done yet when you looked and when I started to look because, the build badge is now gone and replaced with \"av-nightly-image\".\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
