The verified string can then be used with the ConvertFrom-Json cmdlet convert a JSON-formatted string to a JSON object, which is easily managed in PowerShell or sent to another program or web service that access JSON input. Many web sites use JSON instead of XML to serialize data for communication between servers and web-based apps. This cmdlet was introduced in PowerShell 6.1 </div></blockquote>",

Yes, I should have read the examples as well.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a good alias for the `-Schema` parameter would be `-SchemaString`. That might go with an alias for `-Json` as `-JsonString`.\r\n\r\nDoes the proposed change include `-JsonFile` and `-SchemaFile`?",
