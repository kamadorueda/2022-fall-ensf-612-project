    "body": "I also had a repro of a similar problem where the function from the HelperMod still seems to exist (`gcm` finds it), but it seemed to have lost its definition. I wasn't able to get a simplified repro of that, but in retrospect, I think it was related to the fact that I had some other module in my module path that also used HelperMod, and it /did/ export HelperMod's functions, but when pwsh tried to load it, it was unable to load it for an unrelated reason (because the `Hyper-V` required module was not found).",
