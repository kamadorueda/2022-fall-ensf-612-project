    "body": "The Engine WG discussed this yesterday. Initially we were unsure if this was done purposefully and decided it needed more research.\r\n\r\nAfter looking into it, I'm pretty confident it is a bug. `LanguagePrimitives` internally replaces the `fromType` with `InternalPSObject` if the pso has no base object. The code in core adapter sort of tries to emulate `LanguagePrimitives`' code to fall back to the base object, but it omits the translation from an empty PSO to `InternalPSObject`.\r\n\r\nThe difference in code path is due to this being part of overload *selection* rather than invocation. So it can't call the same code path that actually performs the conversion. Seems like it was just an oversight.\r\n\r\nThe fallback code from `DotNetAdapter`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/b46ac16e09dce433dbc1ecb19ab949754eef4978/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CoreAdapter.cs#L860-L868\r\n\r\nAnd from `LanguagePrimitives`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/b46ac16e09dce433dbc1ecb19ab949754eef4978/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/LanguagePrimitives.cs#L4786-L4812\r\n\r\nMarking up for grabs.",
