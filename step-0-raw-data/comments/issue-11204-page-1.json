    "body": "Password entry for multiple sessions is not currently supported, unfortunately.  The reason is that SSH client writes directly to the console/terminal to prompt for a password.  If multiple computer targets are specified, there is an SSH client session for each trying to prompt for a password at the same time.\r\n\r\nA possible fix would be to force session connection to be performed sequentially rather than in parallel.  But this would be a performance hit for cases that don't require prompt (e.g., user keys).\r\n\r\nWorkarounds:\r\n1. Use user keys for authentication and bypass password prompt.\r\n2. Create remote session individually and pass already created sessions to Invoke-Command instead of computer names.",
