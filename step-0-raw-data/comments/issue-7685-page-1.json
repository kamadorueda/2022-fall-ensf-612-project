    "body": "Windows PowerShell used the WMI Win32_PingStatus class and each object in the output is an instance of Win32_PingStatus.  Since WMI and that class is Windows specific, `Test-Connection` needed to be rewritten for ICMP pings to work cross platform.  It was reimplemented using the NetInformation.Ping class.  The output you see at the console which resembles the `ping` command output is synthetic and is written to the Information channel.  If you don't want to see it, you can do:\r\n\r\n> Test-Connection foo -InformationAction Ignore\r\n\r\nThe new summary object that is returned is arguably more useful than the Win32_PingStatus instances that you would need to evaluate to determine if it was overall successful or not.",

    "body": "My thoughts, after playing around with the code:\r\n\r\n1. Either *ditch* or actually, _properly_ utilise `WriteProgress`. Currently it displays only the exact same data as is being shown in the host output. There is no reason for its inclusion here. If, for example, it was hidden behind an _optional_ switch, or configured to display actual progress (i.e., number of pings attempted thus far out of total count being attempted) then perhaps it could be useful.\r\n    * I suspect it's simply too intrusive for what has historically been a very simple command, however.\r\n2. Ditch the host output completely for everything other than `-TraceRoute`. It makes sense there, but given the object-oriented nature of PowerShell, there being host output by default as *well* as an object in the output stream is very weird and counter to the behaviour of basically every other cmdlet in existence.\r\n    * Keep this information posted to the Information stream, in my opinion, but just ditch the usage of the \"PSHost\" tag everywhere except in the `-TraceRoute` code paths so that it doesn't display by default.\r\n3. As @RichardSiddaway mentions, the default display for these objects is very unusual as well. I *do* like the grouping by target machine. That's great. However, the default display gives basically *zero* information other than \"there were some attempts to ping this destination\".\r\n\r\nI mean, *look* at it:\r\n```\r\nSource Destination Replies\r\n------ ----------- -------\r\nDawn   8.8.8.8     {System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingReply, System.Net.NetworkInformation.PingReply, System.Net.Net...\r\n```\r\nVery not-useful. All you get is source and destination, which you *probably* already know, since you executed the command in the first place, and a bunch of meaningless type names.\r\n\r\nI would suggest in terms of the default formatting, it ought to ditch the third column entirely (keep it structured that way internally for querying purposes), and add some new ones (both to formatting display *and* the actual objects):\r\n* Successes ( simple integer counting the .Replies objects with `Status: Success` )\r\n* Failures ( as above, but for failures )\r\n* RoundTripAverage ( as above, the average of all RoundTripTime properties from the contained .Replies objects)\r\n\r\nSo, the \"summary object\" _ought_ to actually be a useful summary, with the individual `.Replies` still present but hidden in the default formatting, while remaining readily available for the user to work with, should they need to.\r\n\r\nSample display of the above suggestion of default display:\r\n```\r\nSource Destination Successes Failures RoundtripAverage\r\n------ ----------- --------- -------- ----------------\r\nDawn   8.8.8.8             4        0               26\r\n```\r\nMuch more useful to work with, no? For reference, this is the wrangling needed to get useful display out of this command:\r\n```powershell\r\nTest-Connection 8.8.8.8 -InformationAction Ignore |\r\n    Select-Object -Property Source, Destination, @{\r\n        Name       = 'Successes'\r\n        Expression = { $_.Replies.Where{$_.Status -eq 'Success'}.Count }\r\n    }, @{\r\n        Name       = 'Failures'\r\n        Expression = { $_.Replies.Where{$_.Status -eq 'Fail'}.Count }\r\n    }, @{\r\n        Name       = 'RoundtripAverage'\r\n        Expression = { ($_.Replies.RoundtripTime | Measure-Object -Average).Average }\r\n    } | Format-Table\r\n```\r\nIt's a bit much, don'tcha think? ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nSidenote: `-TraceRoute` also produces differently-structured objects, and I think should have a different approach to the summary object. It probably ought to output a *series* of summary objects similar to the aforementioned ones, one for each host it tries to reach in the trace.\r\n\r\n*insert hacker montage for the kids*\r\n\r\nSo I managed to accomplish most of this (removing write-progress, updating the standard summary object, hiding majority of host display) pretty easily and if you guys *want* this to change I can happily submit a PR for this.\r\n\r\nThere may be more elegant solutions available to those of you more familiar with the code, however. (Also, I need to look into how the heck output formatting is defined now...)",

    "body": ">The current implementation is experimental port to get feedback.\r\n>There is two scenario - interactive and script - and both clash. In interactive one we want verbose console output and in script one we don't want console output.\r\n\r\nThere could definitely be a need for the default display in an interactive scenario. But in *none* of the scenarios is the `WriteProgress()` useful. It gives *identical* information to what is being passed to host. If it is kept, it should be utilised properly as suggest; otherwise, it can be removed as it really adds nothing. Additionally, `-Quiet` ***should absolutely*** suppress all display. That is the _dictionary definition_ of \"Quiet\".\r\n\r\n>There is bugs in CoreFX. We have a tracking issue. Without fixing it we can not get well working Test-Connection.\r\n\r\nI disagree. There may be bugs, but we should make a best effort to give useful information to the user, *not* sit and wait while the bugs don't get fixed for months or years. The implementation can be updated when the bugs are fixed, but in the meantime it should at least be meaningfully usable in *both* an interactive and programmatic way.\r\n\r\nSidenote: Do you have a link to this issue?\r\n\r\n>Also... @vexx32 The cmdlet is sometimes tricky. It does reverse lookups to show real information not user input.\r\n\r\nI noticed. This can simply be added to the available information in the internal PingReply objects.\r\n\r\nAfter some tweaking, this is the output:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Joel\\source\\repos\\PSCore> test-connection 8.8.8.8 | ft -property source, destination, bytes, roundtriptime, status\r\n\r\nSource Destination Bytes RoundtripTime  Status\r\n------ ----------- ----- -------------  ------\r\nDawn   8.8.8.8        32            25 Success\r\nDawn   8.8.8.8        32            22 Success\r\nDawn   8.8.8.8        32            31 Success\r\nDawn   8.8.8.8        32            26 Success\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis took maybe a half hour, and is using the exact same information that the cmdlet already pulls from. If we add a default format for this object, the `ft` call is unnecessary, and it fits in perfectly well with the PS Core ecosystem.\r\n\r\nGiven that it is this easy to pull the information you would normally get into a PowerShell standard format, I see *no actual need* for the current status display utilising the host output. User gets the same display in a PS Core-standard format if needed, and if they want to use it programmatically it is automatically hidden instead of being a frustrating experience to suppress. As @RichardSiddaway mentions, this kind of information is typically reserved for the `Verbose` stream and should follow that pattern here, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nFrankly, the fact that use of the `\"PSHOST\"` tag in `WriteInformation()` mandates the use of the `Ignore` state and does not respect `SilentlyContinue` on `-InformationAction` is itself obtuse and counter to other stream behaviours, but that's another issue.\r\n\r\nI would love to see the cmdlet further expanded, but I think the immediate focus should be on making it somewhat comparable to the expected output from PS 5.1. It need not be *identical*, the objects need not be the *same*, but it should be relatively comparable.\r\n\r\nThere is no sense in building upon a foundation that is incomplete. ",

I've been trying to get the formatter to snip the `Address` column at 24 characters, but it seems whenever it hits a nice long IPv6 address it completely ignores that, and I really don't know why.\r\n\r\nThe traceroute seems to exhibit bugged behaviour (perhaps what @iSazonov was alluding to?) in that it doesn't record proper status responses, hostnames, nor a roundtrip time for any point along the trace except the last hop.",

Really the only case I can see for the progress bar is what you mention in #6557 about the possibility for the user to specify a large number of requests to an unreachable host.\n\nIt is for that reason that I would *perhaps* consider having it be displayed, but if it is, it should probably display something like... Number of ping attempts to the host out of the total being attempted. Possibly traceroute would also display which hop it is on and number of pings no the current host.\n\nHowever... Much of that is a non-issue if the cmdlet is outputting objects as data is being returned (even if the object only contains a _failed_ ping).",

    "body": "Right, but why not simply emulate that *in the object output*, just like every other cmdlet in PowerShell? `Get-ChildItem` emulates or approximates *display* of the `dir` / `ls` command whilst actually outputting objects with the same data that is programmatically useful. Host output cannot be used in this way, cannot be piped, and is difficult to suppress (have to use `-InformationAction Ignore` instead of `SilentlyContinue` like every other stream in existence, which makes discovering the method of suppression more difficult).\r\n\r\nThis is what I have attempted to do in my brief attempt (see prior comments for initial results), and I would think that users would prefer to be able to *use* the displayed data over providing exact output of 1990s-era DOS/linux `ping` utility output.",

That is a test connection. I mean a ping with `Quiet` parameter. This is what is most often used in scripts. I agree that we can remove all host output. I agree that we can remove a progress bar (temporarily until the progress bar subsystem improvement).\r\n\r\nThat's all we can do today. Everything else \"depends on\" and I would postpone these exercises.\r\n\r\nLong message. \r\nI would have corrected this scenario (quiet ping) a long time ago, but every month we receive a new feedback (that is not directly related to this), which gives us hope that something more can be done.\r\n\r\nBelow are ideas Iâ€™m sure:\r\n- We should preserve standard dotnet types.\r\nWe have several issues that suggest that adding new properties to standard types degrades performance and creates other difficulties. (Although this opportunity remains very attractive.)\r\nWhat is the right way? There are two ways to add new properties. Improve CoreFX. Improve formatting subsystem.\r\n\r\n- Cmdlets should not care about formatting output. This is an area for formatting subsystem.\r\nCurrently in interactive sessions a pipeline implicitly ends with Default-Output. This is what smart formatting should do. Perhaps the only smart thing that this cmdlet can do now is to collect objects with a delay and display a table, although this has side problems and looks as a hack.\r\n_The best idea for improving the formatting subsystem is discussed in PSCore issue._\r\nI think it is worth to make every effort to implement it as quickly as possible. I guess we can do it step by step although Jason is not sure about it.\r\n\r\n- Progress bar subsystem must be smarter.\r\nCurrently the subsystem consumes a lot of resources, does a lot of allocations, does a lot of locks, slows down scripts and it is ill suited for multi-threading.\r\nToday there is no exact way to do it better, but we already have useful feedbacks.\r\nClearly this should benefit from asynchronous.",
