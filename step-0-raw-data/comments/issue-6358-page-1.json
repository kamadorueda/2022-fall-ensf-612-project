In this case, the call is expected to return immediately, so I don't think there's a need to wrap it in `Wait-UntilTrue` otherwise we'd do that everywhere (and would be best if Pester had some automatic timeout capability which is an open issue for them already).\r\n\r\nI also noticed that `Wait-UntilTrue` doesn't work exactly as expected.  If the pipeline is blocked, the timeout never happens.  That helper should be rewritten to invoke the scriptblock async.",
