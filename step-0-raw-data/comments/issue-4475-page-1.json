No error is thrown and powershell tries to open up an SSH session with a bogus path (which throws an unhandled exception) at line 2050.\r\n* real keyfiles seem to fail the test, so powershell throws an error with the `RemotingErrorIdStrings.KeyFileNotFound` string.\r\n\r\nRegarding the suggested workaround - how would I tell powershell to use a keyfile without providing a -KeyFilePath parameter? I tried adding the key to my ssh-agent, but that didn't work. I also tried saving my keyfile at the default location (~/.ssh/id_rsa) but that doesn't work via the New-PSSession command. If I try using SSH directly, I'm able to use my ssh key (as well as keys loaded into the ssh-agent).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9924835/29049294-f4389aae-7b89-11e7-9167-2f1a2a8b55eb.png)\r\n",

This is due to an error in PowerShell in how it passes the key path to the ssh child process.  That is why the keypath works with ssh by itself but not with PowerShell using ssh.  To use ssh automatic user key location you need to set that up.  For example the public key needs to go into a .ssh/authorized_keys file if sshd_config is set up for it.  See ssh user authentication key documentation for more information.\r\n\r\nI just noticed that PowerShell's ssh argument parsing didn't handle paths with spaces correctly while investigating this issue.  I didn't mean to imply that your case was affected by it.  But this will also need to be fixed.  KeyFilePath works correctly on Windows so this appears to only be broken for Linux platforms.\r\n",

I was able to resolve the issues with:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Security-protection-of-various-files-in-win32-openssh\r\nUser identity keys are essentially user credentials and I am sure Linux has similar restrictions.
