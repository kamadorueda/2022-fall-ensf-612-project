    "body": "Ok. Thanks for the info. However, if you really suspect that the presence of an older NuGet package is really the culprit then there seems to be an underlying issue (in general or in the test) that should be solved rather than being swept under the carpet by flushing the cache. It might be OK as a quick workaround to get it back to work to unblock things but understanding the failure would still be essential IMHO. I cannot believe that this is the case (although I haven't looked into what the test does) and even if so having a pre or post build event with a specific cleanup action would still be a better solution and one could even prove more specifically that this NuGet package is the culprit",
