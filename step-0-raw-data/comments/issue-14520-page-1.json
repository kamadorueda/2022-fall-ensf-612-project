If you want something that works on both Windows and other platforms don't use `cp` and instead use `Copy-Item` so you are calling the PowerShell cmdlet directly.",

    "body": "> But why can't it call the native /bin/cp and rewrite the -Force option the way it should work\r\n\r\nYou now have to maintain a static list of all binaries and options to map to which would be ungodly difficult to maintain. Even then you can't guarantee that `cp` will always accept `-f`.\r\n\r\n> Can't powershell be considered a wrapper for native commands?\r\n\r\nDepends on how you define a wrapper. PowerShell is a shell which can be used to call native commands. It's not always wrapping those commands, i.e. `Copy-Item` does not call `cp` internally but uses a bunch of syscalls through .NET.\r\n\r\nSo if you want something that is platform agnostic, use the PowerShell cmdlets (`Copy-Item`) to copy the file.",
