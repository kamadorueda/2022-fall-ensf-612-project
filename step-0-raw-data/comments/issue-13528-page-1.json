I am currently using [Get-CMDriver] to pull all Windows drivers from ConfigMgr (SCCM/MEMCM) , then I present those drivers for selection via Out-GridView.  The driver list can be 10,000 drivers long and I need to narrow my search for the driver I am looking for.  That search field is the best way to accomplish this. I pull driver [name] and [ContentPath]  fields and  I use Out-GridView to locate the drivers I am look to remove from SCCM\\MEMCM by their ContentPath.  The ContentPath  contains spaces [Win 10 - Dell - Latitude 3400 (64Bit) A05] and I would love to type [Latitude 3400] but I can only type [Latitude3400].  As a result I have to copy the text [Latitude 3400] to perform my search in order to select the object I wish to interact with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGC\n",

Be sure to install the module and allow clobbering to overwrite the old version of Out-Gridview.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ninstall-module microsoft.powerShell.graphicaltools -allowclobber\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe new `Out-Gridview` behaves a little differently. It behaves more like a Convert cmdlet. You will need to specify the properties you want to see. Even then, I had to specify the full name to the new version.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ndir c:\\work -file | Select LastWriteTime,Length,Name | microsoft.powershell.graphicaltools\\out-gridview\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ended up overwriting the `ogv` alias.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nset-alias -name ogv  -value microsoft.powershell.graphicaltools\\out-gridview -force\r\n```",
