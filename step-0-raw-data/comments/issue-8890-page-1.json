    "body": "Thanks for the fast action!  FYI, a use case for StringsOnly is where numeric data needs to be treated as a string.  Presumably the information in already stored in PowerShell as a string, so using StringOnly would force PowerShell to quote the string so the program reading the data knows it's a string and not numeric.  (Unfortunately, Excel is dumb in this regard and treats quoted numerics as numerics, not strings; however, there are other programs that don't.)\r\n\r\nAn example would be ID#s which may have leading zeros (e.g. \"0004738749837\"), especially if the leading zeros are significant (e.g. the data contains both \"001234\" and \"0000001234\").  Such situations can arise when using variable length coding schemes.  \r\n\r\nAnother case would be hex data.  Some programs will look at 0087 and treat is as numeric, even though further down in the same column we might have 09DA, which is clearly intended to be hex.  Forcing the data to be quoted would (ideally) treat the entire column as strings, not just those that have letters in them.\r\n\r\nConsider the case of encoding a binary value into a string.  \"0012\" might represent two bytes coded as a string, while \"12\" (leading zeros stripped) would represent a single byte.",

    "body": "@DavidBerg-MSFT I think what @iSazonov is concerned about is that when translating some types of objects to a string form, you can end up with their representation containing commas. In fact, some systems of recording _numbers_ will result in commas depending on the culture settings. I believe several European cultures actually notate a decimal point with a comma instead of a period. This would break the resulting file, if you attempted to have it create the file without quoting numbers as strings.\r\n\r\nUltimately, trying to determine ahead of time which types of objects can and cannot stringify well and not break the format is liable to be a _very_ large waste of time; the file created _is_ going to be a text file, by design of the CSV format. It is arguably much more effective to simply assume data is string and allow the program that intends to consume it to determine the format however is appropriate for its requirements.",

In the US, default numeric formatting usually drops the comma (e.g. 1234.56); however, in the other countries it's the period that would be dropped (e.g. 1234,56), so we still have to deal with the comma.\r\n\r\nIn those cases (numbers that contain a comma) it would be necessary to either:\r\n\r\n1. Use Always (current default), \r\n2. Use AsNeeded, or \r\n3. Use a different delimiter (e.g. a tab or semi-colon).  Then we can use Never or StringOnly (which would otherwise break).\r\n\r\nThat's a strong argument for making Always or AsNeeded the default, but I don't think it eliminates the value of Never and StringOnly (especially since we can change the delimiter, I particularly like tab as it almost never occurs in string values).\r\n\r\nI've run into the same problem at times importing data where unquoted text contains commas.  In those cases, if I can't quote the text, I usually try replacing the delimiter with a non-conflicting one.\r\n\r\nYes, ideally the target program will handle the data correctly; however, the more/better hints we can give it, the easier it is to work with the data.",

Which brings up a question on how to treat non-fundamental types.   I see a couple options:\r\n\r\n1) Always treat non-fundamental types as non-strings.  Easiest: we test for string type, anything else isn't quoted).   And most literal (StringsOnly does exactly what it says).  Fallback is to use AsNeeded.\r\n2) Always treat non-fundamental types as strings (tougher, because then StringsOnly really becomes DontQuoteNumbersDatesAndBooleans…., requiring more testing, and becoming more confusing about what is or isn't considered a string).\r\n3) Something like option 1, but also check for something like a ShouldOutputAsString field/property on objects... (too complex, I wouldn't do it just for this; however, I have built systems where data objects had metadata properties that provided hints for how to properly format them in different situations, it was quite nice).\r\n4) Eliminate StringsOnly in favor of -QuoteFields <fieldList>, as that is a superset (allowing the caller to specify what they do/don't want quoted).\r\n5) Eliminate StringsOnly as not being well enough thought out.\r\n\r\nIn terms of preference, I'd probably pick (in order) 4, 1, 5 (and not really consider 2 or 3).

Question is that is \"smart\" and \"expected\" in the context.\r\nAs @vexx32 pointed all is converted to strings before output to CSV. So user expectations can be based only on original types of values. We could implement exclude and include type lists with common defaults. In the case it is not clear benefits because excluding only fundamental types doesn't look smart enough. Also we'll have to add parameters to allow users modify the lists. Fallback to AsNeeded can confuse users too - it can be \"over-smart\". This leads us to believe that StringOnly parameter is not as useful as expected and QuoteFields is better alternative - does not require additional parameters and it is very fast.",
