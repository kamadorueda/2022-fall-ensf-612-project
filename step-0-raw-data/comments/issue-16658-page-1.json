With cycle I would have to press tab 7 times from `Get-NetF` or practically typed in the full command before hitting tab.  \r\nIt's also great for parameters where you can get a static list of all the parameters like this: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42123497/148311640-d93f5f9f-96bf-4582-b152-2eb9aef7b961.png)\r\nThis is a custom key handler I made but it takes inspiration from the 1.2 version of PSReadline.",

I've known him since at least 1994 when he taught one of Microsoft's first classes on \"Chicago\" which was named that week as \"Windows 95\". NT at that point still had the Windows 3.1 interface and everyone in the class railed against the \"Start\" menu which was appearing for the first time. More than a quarter of a century Thomas's comment that \"The new one is more intuitive, but your intuition has been bent by years of experience\" has stayed with me. \r\n\r\nI'm not disputing that Unix shells of the 1970s set a pattern of behaviour, which later Unix/Linux shells have retained. That doesn't mean there is no possibility of improvement. \r\n\r\nWhen your example has  `interfaceIndex` and `interfaceAlias`  as well as `InformationAction` and `InformationVariable` making the user type `informationA`  or `interfacei` before completing requires them to do more work than cycling through the options with tab (or selecting from a list called up with ctrl+space).  If the jobs of tab completion are to reduce typing and help the user discover commands and parameters, then way which Windows PowerShell introduced does those jobs better.   As someone who has embraced this way, _of course_ I think it is the best way invented to date. But the idea behind psreadline was to extend what PowerShell could do, including supporting people who don't want things to work that way - those _whose intuition has been bent by years of experience_.  My hunch is whichever options one sets for the shell, one looks at users of the opposite option with incomprehension. \r\n\r\nAll that said. What @jborean93  points out is valid and important.  \r\n\r\n1. If an unambiguous shortening of a parameter name is typed, it may be preferable to expand it to the full name by pressing tab\r\n2.  If  anything was unambiguous making it ambiguous can be problematic. In this case it changes the behaviour for a set of users in a way which certainly would feel like a breaking change to them.  A fix of \"Just use `-UR`  (don't expand the name once PowerShell can handle it)\" or \"Change your PsReadline options\" isn't desirable for them.  \r\n3. If the cmdlets in question had implemented the proposed alias from Day 1 there would be no complaint.  But retro-fitting it  has consequences. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
