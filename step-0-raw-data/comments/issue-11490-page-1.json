There is no special syntactic support. The operator just receives left and right operands. It's then up to the operator implementation to interpret those arguments.  For example, the `-replace` operator checks to see if its RHS is a non-string  `IEnumerable` and if it is, parses it as a value + replacement string:\r\n```powershell\r\n{master}PSCore (1:103) >  \"abcd\" -replace \"[ac]\",\"|\"\r\n|b|d\r\n{master}PSCore (1:104) >  $a = \"[ac]\",\"|\"\r\n{master}PSCore (1:105) >   \"abcd\" -replace $a\r\n|b|d\r\n```\r\nGoing back to the issue at hand, `-join` already has defined behaviour if the RHS is an `IEnumerable` so adding any interpretation to those values would be a breaking change.",
