PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detected.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiZGF2aWRCYXItT24iLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTU1NDUiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJUaHVtYnNVcCJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiZGF2aWRCYXItT24iLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTU1NDUiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJOZXV0cmFsIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiZGF2aWRCYXItT24iLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTU1NDUiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJUaHVtYnNEb3duIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",
