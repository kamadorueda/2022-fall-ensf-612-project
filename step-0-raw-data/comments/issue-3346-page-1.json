This verb is paired with Uninstall.\r\nFor this action, do not a use verb such as Setup.\r\n\r\nIf you have a Deploy, you also need a Rollback verb. Install and Uninstall both already cover those concepts quite well.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, you could change the Install language to say it is intended for **local** resources while Deploy is used for remote resources. \r\n\r\nFor Build, I think in software dev it makes more sense than any other verb. The guidance for New though should be updated to remove Build from the list of \"do not use\" verbs.\r\n",

    "body": "The trick of keeping standard verbs and buzzwords..... Playing Devil's Advocate here.\r\n\r\nI just remembered that there is also a `Publish` and `Unpublish` verb-set. \r\n> Makes a resource available to others. This verb is paired with Unpublish. \r\n> For this action, do not use verbs such as Deploy, Release, or Install.\r\n\r\n`Publish` is used in Visual Studio instead of `Deploy` for some of the built-in deployment option. So between `Install`, `Deploy`, and `Publish` you have major overlaps of similar concepts. Is it really worth muddling the waters more? I'm assuming its because of the DevOps push and to be more generally accepted driving this. With better guidance, it can be made to work though.\r\n\r\nThinking in terms of Deploy itself. Does it make sense in the context of a Cmdlet vs a Script? When is it better to have a Deploy verb vs a Deploy script with no need for an approved verb? Deployments often are a series of commands (hopefully cmdlets) that do a `Build | Copy | Register | Update-SqlSchema | Update-SqlData`. Should I wrap that into a Deploy cmdlet or would I have a Deploy script that did all of the actions needed? Does wrapping that many things into a single cmdlet go with the original principles of doing one thing well?\r\n\r\n@ArieHein For simple deployments, yes, a `Deploy -Version` works, I also wonder why you would be using Deploy in that case and not just `Copy-Item`. `Build -Version | Copy -Destination`. More complex deployments change the state of the machine or data. In those scenarios, you might have to run unregister/uninstall commands, restore database commands, etc. While you could do that with a `-Rollback` parameter, that goes against the idea of the Verb-Noun concept in PowerShell and doing one thing well.\r\n\r\nFood for thought. I would love to see more feedback on how people are planning to use these verbs and if it makes the most sense to have Deploy/Rollback Cmdlets over a Deploy Script. Personally, I've been doing larger tasks like that as scripts and using Cmdlets to build up re-usable tasks. ",

From a DevOps perspective these verbs would typically be used for a script vs a single cmdlet where multiple tasks, steps, things would be done during build or deploy. What that means from an approved verb perspective I will leave up to @joeyaiello, @HemantMahawar & co.\r\n\r\nAs far as Deploy vs Install goes, I see Deploy as more than just a remote vs local thing. Deployments will typically consist of a number of different actions such as configuration, installation, etc. against a number of different targets. For example deploying a web application consists of copying bits, opening ports, configuring IIS, etc. I think the unique thing with deployments vs installations is that deployments will configure components that are not \"Owned\" by the component being deployed. So I do think that deploy make sense as an additional verb and is different than install.\r\n\r\nI agree with @ArieHein points on a Rollback verb. Rollback in a DevOps is typically just another Deployment with the previous configuration. If a component does do an actual rollback where the system is reverted to the previous state, not just applying old config, then the verb would make sense. \r\n",
