    "body": "@thezim the way `/etc/paths` and `/etc/paths.d/` is implemented is through a call to `path_helper` in `/etc/profile`. so this isn't the OS giving `PATH` to the login shell, its the login shell generating `PATH` on initialization through its profile. There are 2 possible switched to `path_helper`: `-c` and `-s`, `-c` generated a `csh` string that can be evaluated by `csh` to setup the path and likewise `-s` does the same for `sh` and friends. \r\n\r\nWhat I'm suggesting is the best ultimate path is to have Apple add a `-p` which emits a string that can  evaluated by `Invoke-Expression` and then we can implement it similar to the other shells in our own `pwsh` global profile. \r\n\r\nUntil then, I'm suggesting we parse the output of `path_helper -s` or `path_helper -c` rather than in our own code try to duplicate the logic of `path_helper`. That way we can avoid having to race to maintain our implementation when Apple possibly changes to either include new PATH definition locations or remove existing ones. Also, then we wont have to worry about differences that may exist between, say, macOS 10.12 and macOS 10.15, just as bash/sh/csh don't need to worry about such things.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, if you have bash/sh as your login shell and then launch pwsh, the PATH as defined in the parent shell IS respected in PowerShell. `/etc/paths` and `/etc/paths.d/` only auto loads for the login shell. if you were to log in with bash, add a new item to `/etc/paths.d/`, and then launch python, it would not see the new path. Same with pwsh. The reason you see new paths created since login in child sh/bash/csh shells is that they evaluate `/etc/profile` on launch too.\r\n\r\nThe reason pwsh as a login shell doesn't process `/etc/paths` and `/etc/paths.d/`  is because pwsh does not run `/etc/profile` and really couldn't because it is written for other shells that use a completely different language.",

    "body": "@abock I feel like creating a temporary function and then deleting it is a bit hacky. \r\n\r\nIn my experience, Environment variables are used way more heavily in *nix than Windows. With that in mind, I think it probably  makes sense to expose a `Set-EnvironmentVariable` with the `setenv` alias along with a `Get-EnvironmentVariable` with the `getenv` alias.  \r\n\r\n`Set-EnvironmentVariable` would take a `-Name` and `-Value` with `-Name`  as position 0 and `-Value` position 1. This would also help with some confusion about ENV vars only accepting strings as the `-Value` parameter would accept a String.\r\n\r\nWith that in place, the profile can work very similar to the csh: `Test-Path` for `path_helper`, execute with `-c`, and then evaluate with `Invoke-Expression`.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, means exposing 2 new cmdlets that will probably not see much heavy usage outside of macOS and possibly other *nix.  They are kind of redundant given powershell exposes the `$env:` variable prefix. But I still think this is the cleaner solution.\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is to have `setenv` as an alias of `Set-Variable` and some kind of logic to set an environment variable when the `setenv` alias is called. I'm not real thrilled with this solution. I dislike command behavior changing based on `InvocationName`. This is just as \"hacky\" to me as creating a temporary function and removing it.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@markekraus: Good analysis; clarification:\r\n\r\n> The reason you see new paths created since login in child sh/bash/csh shells is that they evaluate /etc/profile on launch too.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSIX-compatible shells such as `bash` (including `bash` in disguise on macOS, `sh`)  and `ksh` (but _not_ `zsh`) source `/etc/profile` _only_ when (effectively) launched as a _login_ shell, with option `-l` or via `login` (see below).\r\nThis happens _implicitly_ when `Terminal.app`, the macOS terminal program, creates a new tab / window, but it doesn't happen when you, say, invoke `bash` (without `-l`) from an existing shell.\r\nThis behavior is specific to macOS: terminal programs on Linux create _non-login_ shells by default - see https://stackoverflow.com/a/23233967/45375\r\n\r\n`pwsh -l` would actually break (PowerShell neither knows `-l`, nor does it know the distinction between a login shell and a(n interactive) non-login shell), but `login`, which is what `Terminal.app` uses, employs a different, convention-based technique to signal to the shell invoked that it should consider itself a _login_ shell: it places the name of the shell preceded by `-` in the first argv argument (`$0`, in POSIX terms); e.g., `-bash`.\r\nThis is clearly something that PowerShell can - and does - ignore.\r\n\r\nArguably, though, PowerShell _should_ pay attention to that, and evaluate `/usr/libexec/path_helper` output only then.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is _technically_ feasible: both `[environment]::CommandLine` and `[environment]::GetCommandLineArgs()` seem to only reflect the _PowerShell DLL name_ from within PowerShell; e.g., `/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0-beta.9/pwsh.dll`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for a simpler way to apply `/usr/libexec/path_helper` output, using PowerShell code, without requiring ephemeral functions:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nif ($IsMacOs) { $env:PATH=((/usr/libexec/path_helper) -split '\"')[1] }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this assumes that there are no _escaped, embedded_ `\"` chars., but that's generally a reasonable assumption (which @abock's function-based,  `/usr/libexec/path_helper -c` relies on, too).\r\n\r\nArguably, this code belongs in `$profile.AllUsersAllHosts` - ideally, however, with a conditional that only applies it if `$0` starts with `-`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMore generally, https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/975#issuecomment-331049792 discusses how PowerShell might fit into the world of POSIX-compatible shells.\r\n\r\n ",
