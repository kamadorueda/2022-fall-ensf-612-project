So why does `return $someValue` even exist as valid syntax?  It makes it look an AWFUL lot like you are just returning `$someValue`.  Wouldn't it make more sense to say, if you want to just output anything emitted to the pipeline, say `return`.  If you want to swallow that and just output a certain value, say `return $someValue`?  Right now it seems like some weird hybrid where it outputs everything that was emitted previously AND `$someValue`.  I'd be interested to know the thinking that went into that decision.",
