To clarify, when you say it's by design do you mean that the behavior itself was considered desirable at the time or was it more of a technical limitation/implementation detail?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSome more examples that will force invocation on the remote machine:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$s = New-PSSession -ComputerName localhost -ConfigurationName microsoft.powershell32\r\n\r\n# Invokes property getter locally (returns True).\r\nicm -Session $s { echo ([Environment]::Is64BitProcess) }\r\n\r\n# These force invocation in remote session (returns False).\r\nicm -Session $s { ''; echo ([Environment]::Is64BitProcess) }\r\nicm -Session $s { (echo ([Environment]::Is64BitProcess)) }\r\nicm -Session $s { echo ([Environment]::Is64BitProcess) | % { $_ } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nBasically anything that forces a change from `AddCommand` to `AddScript`.\r\n\r\n> I think it would be a pretty big breaking change, but I'll mark this for committee review.\r\n\r\n❤️ ",
