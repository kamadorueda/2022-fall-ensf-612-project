    "body": "Currently RegisterManifest.ps1 attempts to uninstall the manifest before installing it (again). If it is possible that the provider GUID or channel names/types have changed since the manifest was previously installed, then it is not safe to uninstall the new manifest without first uninstalling the old manifest. For this reason it would be best to always uninstall the current manifest when uninstalling the MSI or before overwriting the manifest with a new version.",
