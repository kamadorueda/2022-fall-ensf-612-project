    "body": "@PowerShell/powershell-committee (subset of @HemantMahawar @lzybkr @khansen00 and myself) agree that the original issue (#2860) is by design. It is unreasonable for `ConvertFrom-Json` to emit anything but an error when receiving malformed input, and terminating errors are not respected by `-ErrorAction`. If a developer absolutely wants to make a conscious choice to ignore that terminating error, they should use try/catch. ",
