    "body": "@mklement0 Having Select-String do the same thing makes sense.  I think Set-Clipboard should be an even easier sell than that as the whole purpose is to copy plain text to the clipboard.  I frequently use Format-Table * | clip currently.  It works good and makes it easy to paste into Slack (as code).  Set-Clipboard doesn't need to worry about the performance implications of formatting the output as you don't normally put a million rows into your clipboard.  If you are doing more than a few thousand lines, you would probably be better off exporting your data a different way.  \r\n\r\n",
