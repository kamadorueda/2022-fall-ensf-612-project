There are 6 pages of repos already. I can imagine a dozen more springing up to clean up the code base and dozens more for new things.\n\nSomething to keep in mind for those of us watching the Repos!

Ideally, the community could submit PRs and issues, so IMHO a Microsoft hosted site (unless fed by CI/CD from GitHub) would be less appropriate.\n\nCheers!\n",

I.e. PSReadLine.\n\nDecoupling _can reduce complexity, but it can also create it_.\nI don't see value in separating core modules like `Microsoft.PowerShell.Management`: would it be intended to update from the gallery? If I need to fix a bug that spans across SMA and Microsoft.PowerShell.Management in this decoupling, it would be way harder.\n\nI think these module should stay in the repo:\n- PowerShell.Utility\n- Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics\n- Microsoft.PowerShell.Management\n- Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\n- Microsoft.WSMan.Management\n- PSDiagnostics\n- CimCmdlets\n\nThese modules are for the Full CLR builds and hence again should stay in the repo\n- PSScheduledJob\n- PSWorkflow\n- PSWorkflowUtility\n",

If module updates do apply to downlevel versions of PowerShell, then use a submodule so that the module can be maintained independently as one that works for multiple versions of PowerShell, allowing for updates to be leveraged by all supported versions.  If not, then keep it in the PowerShell/PowerShell repo because it is bound to that project.\n\nPowerShellGet already has downlevel version support (although I don't think the way downlevel support is done in that module right now is the way to go, so there's some work to do there).  PSScriptAnalyzer has downlevel version support.  Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive is outside of PowerShell/PowerShell already, and currently requires version 5+, but it will have downlevel version support shortly once I submit my pull request.  Other core modules listed above in @vors post should stay in the main project IMHO.\n",
