I [answered for the new module resolution behavior](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12036#issuecomment-595425489) over on #12036.)\r\n\r\n@rjmholt The new behavior of auto-importing of Windows PowerShell proxy commands caused a problem during the same PowerShell 5.1 to 7 transition I described [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12036#issuecomment-595425489) and it occurred in a similar manner to that story: I had a module that invoked `Get-WmiObject` that inadvertently loaded the wrong `Get-Item`.  Most modules that called `Get-Item` (which is a lot) then resolved to the wrong `Get-Item` which resulted in errors when the output type didn't match the input type of the downstream command.  None of those modules contained a call to `Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Management` so they were all resolving `Get-Item` in the global scope.  That is a mistake, it seems, albeit not one that is obvious even now.  The solution seems to be to include explicit imports for each module within the module that uses it.",
