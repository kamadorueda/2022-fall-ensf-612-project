    "body": "This might need its own issue, but seems related: build.psm1 is chock full of hard coded distribution checks, which is causing build failures on Arch Linux (PowerShell itself runs fine with freshly built files from the `dotnet-cli` package from the AUR dropped in to the /opt/microsoft/powershell-foo directory) and will act as a significant blocker for bootstrapping on Alpine, Debian, or any other distribution not already listed.  \n\nThis is inefficient, awkward, and wrongheaded.  An upstream build system like PowerShell's should focus on building the executables and libraries needed, and possibly include an installation makefile/psbuild target to drop them into a relative directory. \n\nLet the distributions' package management teams take advantage of that relative-directory installation target and handle packaging themselves.  I guarantee they'll do a better job than Microsoft will, judging by the inadequate code quality in all the Unix-native stuff like build.sh so far.  Even Valve recognizes the benefit their platform receives from allowing binary redistribution and repackaging of the Steam application for Linux.  The only reason to _not_ delegate packaging to the distributions is if Microsoft was planning on taking PowerShell so proprietary that even binary redistribution is banned.   \n\nThat's not anything we have to worry about, **RIGHT?**\n",
