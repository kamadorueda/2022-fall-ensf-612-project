I think this is a slightly different code path; the stuff I fixed before handles it for when the parameter type is `[string]` and that sorts it out there. But I think this problem may be in PSObject's ToString() method itself. The fix should be similar, though... although I'm surprised _decimal_ doesn't work, since that suffix has been around much longer than some of the others that do seem to work. ðŸ¤” ",
