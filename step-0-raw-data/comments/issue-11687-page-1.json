Serializing scriptblocks with fidelity resulted in too many places where there was automatic code execution so to facilitate secure restricted runspaces, scriptblocks are always deserialized to strings.\r\n\r\nGiven that deserialization by itself shouldn't result in code execution, I've always been puzzled by this, so I wonder if it's time to revisit the issue; sounds like by (securely) fixing this behavior, a whole class of bugs relating to the WinPS compatibility feature may go away.\r\n\r\nP.S.: It's good to hear that there's a warning when _manually_ importing modules exposed via the WinPS compatibility feature, but you may never see it, given that these modules are apparently auto-loaded.",
