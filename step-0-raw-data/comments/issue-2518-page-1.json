I'm not sure what I need to do to respond to your requested changes other than send this note. One very noteworthy change came out of this discussion: since you highlighted that List.Remove had a strong negative impact on performance vs in-place sorting of the items in the list, I was able to get a 5x performance improvement out of -Unique -Top/-Bottom sorts, which is great! On a collection of 250K random values between 1 and 175K, Sort -Unique performs 5x faster than before, it performs slightly faster than that with -Bottom N, and it performs faster than that with -Top N. Non-unique -Top/-Bottom N sorts perform more than 2x faster than a base sort (and even more than that with sort | select -First/-Last). As suggested by @iSazonov, I will blog about this change set, probably in an article for PowerShell Magazine. I'm just waiting for results from appveyor/travis CI and will respond to any issues they have if they come up.\n",

    "body": "I just committed an update that improves -unique -top/-bottom sorts performance substantially. On a collection of 500K integers that were generated randomly with values from 1 to 175K, sort -unique took 18 seconds to complete, and with the previous implementation a -Top/-Bottom N -Unique sort would finish slightly faster than that, in around 17 seconds. With these changes, the -Top/-Bottom N -Unique sort finishes in a little over 6 seconds.\n\nI couldn't make this work with the min-/max-heap sort without either walking the heap to see if an item was already added, since an item could be anywhere in the heap.  Walking the heap could result in comparing a new item with every item in the heap in the worst case.  Instead I decided to add another collection to track the unique items. I use SortedSet to store anything unique that is added to the heap, and then skip items that are already in that set instead of adding them to the heap.  This seems pretty efficient, and definitely improves the performance.\n\n@lzybkr Let me know what you think of this commit when you have time to review the most recent changes.  Thanks!\n\n[Update] I committed a follow-up change that removes a few lines that weren't necessary due to the changes I just made, and cleaned up the code in sort-object.cs based on my changes so that it's easier to follow.\n",
