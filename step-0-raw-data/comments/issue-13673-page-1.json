    "body": "> What kind of support in PerfView are you looking for?\r\n\r\nMy thoughts is very simple. Since users will can able to collect PowerShell performance events out-of-process they need tools to analyze the data. \r\n- Developer scenarios. Visual Studio and VS Code PowerShell extension/PES could expose a profiler somewhat. \r\n- Hosting scenarios. Azure, server scripts, PowerShell hosting applications - users will collect PowerShell performance events and they need a __standalone tool__ to analyze them.\r\n_I would like to avoid creating a separate new tool as it is a lot of work._ It would be great to use a well known and reliable PerfView (and maybe WPA).\r\nAs end user I'd expect PerfView will show me a callstack tree like for .Net.\r\nI guess we need to issue events like .Net does. I guess we should emulate such start/stop events. I hope it is possible and simplify PerfView adoption. \r\n\r\n@lzybkr Could you please point me where we could issue a stop event for scriptblock/sequence point?\r\n\r\n@brianrob What do you think? Is it possible? Could you tell me how we should create events correctly for PerfView?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I just skimmed the PR to try and understand how things work.  I would like to make sure I understand how things work, and then have a few questions.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that there is a desire to enable profiling in two ways:\r\n1. Via `Measure-ScriptBlock`, which would result in the use of `EventSource` and `EventListener` to generate results inside of the `pwsh` process, and display them to the console.\r\n2. Via `ETW` or other platform loggers by enabling the events via an out-of-process mechanism.  This profiling would be fully controlled via the platform logger and would occur regardless of whether or not `Measure-ScriptBlock` is invoked.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of pieces of functionality that I can see being implemented in PerfView.  Of course, I'm open to feedback and other ideas as well:\r\n1. The ability to determine how long a particular scriptblock/cmdlet takes to execute.  This can be done via the `Events` view as long as there are start/stop events that get emitted on either side of the execution.  I'm not sure if these exist today, but I don't see them in this PR.\r\n2. Views where we attribute computing resources (CPU, memory allocations, etc.) to their script/cmdlet-based stack.\r\n\r\nFor the computing resource based views, we'd need to understand a couple of things:\r\n1. How to construct the stack.\r\n2. How to resolve symbols (if necessary).\r\n\r\nRight now, PerfView has functionality that does this for jitted code that is compiled on-the-fly by the .NET runtime.  This is done by using rundown events to provide function memory ranges and symbols.  There's mention of both interpreted and jitted code here.  For interpreted code, we'd need events that would allow us to build the appropriate stack.  You could imagine doing this with start/stop events that wrap the \"scope\" of each frame.  This would work as long as collection started before the invocation.  If it is started in the middle of an invocation, we'd see broken stacks, but these may still be valuable depending on how much movement up and down the stack there is.  For jitted code, are we talking about using the .NET runtime's JIT, or something else?",

Views where we attribute computing resources (CPU, memory allocations, etc.) to their script/cmdlet-based stack.\r\n\r\nYes for 1. Currently we issue an event with number 1 as start event but without the \"start\" label. \r\nFrom your comment I see that we need (1) both start and stop events, (2) a way to track a script stack. \r\nI hope @lzybkr give the cue where we could issue stop events and how we could track script stack.\r\n\r\nFor 2. I am not sure we can utilize resource tracking because scripts are executed in runspaces (you can think that it is special thread) and there could be some parallel runspaces so we cannot directly know which runspace is consuming resources- we should track a long correlation sequence scriptblock-runspace-.Net thread. It looks too complex for me. Although it is possible... It is my answer on \"For jitted code, are we talking about using the .NET runtime's JIT, or something else?\" too - it would interesting to have the correlated views (script - JIT) but looks too complex for the first step PR.\r\n\r\n",

There is created pseudo functioncontext with sequence points but without a reference to current scriptblock. \r\n- If we skip issuing the perf event in the case we never see parameter bindings in the profiler. If we issue the perf event there will be no link to a scriptblock and we will not know the context when analyzing.\r\n- In the example we call GetDefaultScriptParameterValue(). So it is called everywhere where parameter binding exists (funcrions/scriptblocks).\r\n- another code path -  GetExpressionValue(). This is used in many places and we may not see it in the profiler too.\r\n\r\nSince these code paths is complex, with static methods without scriptblock parameter it is a huge work to fix all them.\r\nOne workaround I can think is to track functioncontext in interpreter. Is it possible/make sense?\r\n\r\n",

I wired it [together with Pester Code Coverage](https://github.com/pester/Pester/pull/1884/files) (which was suprisingly simple) and don't see any item for the first statement in the file:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# file.ps1\r\n1\r\n2\r\n```\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\nMeasure-Script { & ./file.ps1 }  | % source\r\n\r\n# output: \r\n{\r\n& ./file.ps1\r\n2\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSame for file.ps1 that is `1;2`. But when running `Measure-Script { 1;2 }` it works fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nCould you verify? I added null annotation to File field to be able to build, which does not seem like it would cause the issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Sure. Code is here https://github.com/pester/Pester/blob/v5.0/src/functions/Coverage.ps1\r\n\r\nIn Pester, up until now we've been using breakpoints to do code coverage. In order to avoid rewriting a lot of the code, I am just adapting the results I get from Measure-Script to have the same form as the breakpoints we would set. This way I can just skip setting the breakpoints, and  use Measure-Script instead, and all the code coverage processing code, can remain the same. This makes it easier to get a working prototype, but costs me some details that the Profiler reports, and causes this misalignment.\r\n\r\nThe misalignment is as follows: \r\n\r\nTo set breakpoints up we use AST to find commands (in `Get-CommandsInFile`) and unless they are excluded (in `IsExludedCommand`), we place a breakpoint on them. Those breakpoints are using line + column: \r\n\r\n`$abc = 🔴Get-Command`\r\n\r\nBut the Profiler reports the whole assignment. So if this was a breakpoint it would look like this: \r\n\r\n`🔴$abc = Get-Command`\r\n\r\nThose two have matching line number but not matching column number. So I need to calculate it. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pester/Pester/pull/1884/commits/f4dd58497ad328bf8fa32b9758acff5d51eef4c4#diff-d1d42e6af6c2da4901e781a4ac3dbe51a60b0e8a808f60a8d114e97d8db59af6R678-R688\r\n\r\nIt's not a serious problem and if our code coverage setup would take the specifics of the profiler into account it would not be needed.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/2376848?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/pester/Pester\">pester/Pester</a></strong></div><div>Pester is the ubiquitous test and mock framework for PowerShell. - pester/Pester</div></blockquote>",

    "body": "Few proposals after implementing https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler, while taking this PR into consideration: \r\n- I think Trace-Script would be nicer name for the cmdlet. The data itself are not of much use by themselves. We need some function to post process it and calling it `Measure-Script` (as it is right now in PSProfiler) would be nice.\r\n- Would you consider publishing the structs used for the result? I tested running this against Pester run, which gives me some 3 millions events, and processing them in powershell is still (suprisingly) fast. But having the possibility to write the code directly in C# without requiring IVTs or using reflection would be nice. Or is there a better way to do this without making those types public? \r\n- Having the possibility to exclude files from tracing (as suggested above) would be nice for profiling code that runs user code. E.g. Pester tests.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/c253cf61ca6c49568611e30f0a2f2f0010811adebbfffdb7d5d5cb278b9a651b/nohwnd/Profiler\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler\">nohwnd/Profiler</a></strong></div><div>Script, ScriptBlock and module performance profiler for PowerShell 5, and PowerShell 7.  - nohwnd/Profiler</div></blockquote>",

Or listing all events that happened between entering a function and leaving it.\r\n\r\nHere is how I use it to see if a line is call, process, or return:\r\nhttps://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler/blob/main/Profiler/Trace-Script.ps1#L227-L287\r\n\r\nHere I figure out duration: https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler/blob/main/Profiler/Trace-Script.ps1#L338-L362 \r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/65f58a5970124a59e09e26787f5173f31564769a8616faa363d0900e901d9f99/nohwnd/Profiler\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler\">nohwnd/Profiler</a></strong></div><div>Script, ScriptBlock and module performance profiler for PowerShell 5, and PowerShell 7.  - nohwnd/Profiler</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/65f58a5970124a59e09e26787f5173f31564769a8616faa363d0900e901d9f99/nohwnd/Profiler\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler\">nohwnd/Profiler</a></strong></div><div>Script, ScriptBlock and module performance profiler for PowerShell 5, and PowerShell 7.  - nohwnd/Profiler</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/65f58a5970124a59e09e26787f5173f31564769a8616faa363d0900e901d9f99/nohwnd/Profiler\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/nohwnd/Profiler\">nohwnd/Profiler</a></strong></div><div>Script, ScriptBlock and module performance profiler for PowerShell 5, and PowerShell 7.  - nohwnd/Profiler</div></blockquote>",

Maybe I could somehow reconstruct the flow, but it is not as easy as actually having the number of items on stack. Here is a function that throws inside of a nested function call and swallows the exception few levels up: \r\n```powershell\r\n\r\nfunction a () {\r\n    throw \"aaa\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction b () {\r\n    a\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction c () { \r\n    b\r\n}\r\n\r\ntry { \r\n    c\r\n}\r\ncatch {\r\n    \"failed\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput from this  PR: \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5735905/116805626-040e0000-ab28-11eb-8ee9-b2240e125cb1.png)\r\n\r\nOutput from my profiler where I track the number of items on stack (relative to how many there was when I enabled profiling), plus some info based on it, like the Flow (is the next move up or down), ReturnIndex (where in the log the call returns), CallerIndex (who called us): \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5735905/116805679-46cfd800-ab28-11eb-81da-41379882ac86.png)\r\n\r\nNotice that on the line where there is throw we jump from level 5 to level 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detetcted.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiaVNhem9ub3YiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTM2NzMiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJUaHVtYnNVcCJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiaVNhem9ub3YiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTM2NzMiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJOZXV0cmFsIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiaVNhem9ub3YiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTM2NzMiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJUaHVtYnNEb3duIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",

I hope you understand that I don't have any motivation to remember this old story, especially since I found several other projects that I'm happy to spend my time on. I have already closed most of my unanswered PRs. Since no one was upset, it means no one needs them. The ones I left may be useful to someone or you can close them. I always saw in PowerShell a huge potential to change the ecosystem. Unfortunately this is in a deep sleep and I don't expect it to change in the foreseeable future unfortunately.\r\n",

I think it should be moved into our HelpersCommon module. I know MSFT team prefer to have new cmdlets as community modules so new profiler cmdlets/tools can be released in this way.\r\nOnly @nohwnd showed interest so it's worth realizing what he wants.\r\nApart from this I see another important scenario for developers, administrators and support teams - the possibility of remote collection of events and study them in tools like PerfView and speedscope. I assume they need a couple of Start/Stop events while we now only release the Start event.",

    "body": "The Engine Working Group discussed this PR in the last meeting (7/7), and we agreed to close it with the following reasons:\r\n1. According to [this comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13673#issuecomment-1169502646) from @iSazonov, only @nohwnd showed interests, but @nohwnd already has a working solution and [is OK to close this PR](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13673#issuecomment-1169664529). It indicates that this is not a high demand feature.\r\n\r\n2. Based on the PR description and @iSazonov's comments, the change in this PR is not feature-complete. The biggest concern is that the STOP event is missing because PowerShell currently doesn't emit sequence point on finishing script execution. It may be non-trivial work to add it, so the cost of resource to take over this PR is likely high.\r\n\r\n3. We think our efforts should be put in more recent PRs instead, so hopefully new contributors won't face the same frustration again and again.\r\n\r\nThank you @iSazonov for putting up this PR and led the discussion around the idea of emitting events during script execution. We can always reference this PR when a similar need comes up in future.\r\n",
