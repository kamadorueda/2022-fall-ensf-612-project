At least in the sense of 'different techniques used to create the package'.\r\n\r\nUPD: Also, what about the dev builds on CentOS? I.e. if remoting tests should fail on CentOS, because we run them directly from `dotnet publish` (or maybe even `dotnet build`) directory. Should we move this symlink creation to the `Start-PSBuild` for that matter?",

    "body": "`AfterInstallScript` would be more complex (our pre/post scripts a) are embedded shell scripts in PowerShell and b) should be used only as a last resort).\r\n\r\nThis change is more of a work-around, due to being blocked by #2957 and a similar problem with NuGet itself, thus preventing us from adding the symlinks any earlier. Because of these bugs, symlinks in the installation directory need to be made pretty much right before the call to `fpm`. You're right, this _could_ be done within the post installation script, but that's unnecessarily complicated (IMHO) for a change that will be revisited when the symlink bugs are resolved.",
