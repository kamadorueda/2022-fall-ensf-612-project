That said, it is pretty uncommon to run across processes with a name that parses as a integer.  And the workaround is simple - use the `-Name` parameter.  I'd be willing to risk the back compat issue for the convenience provided.\r\n\r\nBTW why not give `Stop-Process` the same treatment?  Make a new NameOrId parameter and make it the default parameterset.  It annoys me that GPS defaults to name but SPPS defaults to PID.  I'm always forgetting to specify the -Name parameter to Stop-Process when I want to stop all instances of an app.",
