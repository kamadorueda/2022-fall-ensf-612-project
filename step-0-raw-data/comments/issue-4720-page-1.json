    "body": "@chunqingchen : The reason why the `Get-Content` test failed this time was because [this](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/d5521beb18f5269a1cd4e4bcb122ed65f45a05db) commit removed code that had to be re-written but did not remove/disable the test. But it was OK that you set the test to 'Pending' at the moment, because the pending PR #4745  brings back an improved implementation and it will remove the 'Pending' attribute as part of it.\r\n@TravisEz13 : The `Invoke-WebRequest` tests should never fail because they basically check that the download links are still working, therefore this might be rather an issue with the CI environment. Maybe simply using the `-UseBasicParsing` switch for `Invoke-WebRequest` could make it work better?",
