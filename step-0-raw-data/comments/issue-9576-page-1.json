    "body": "I don't think this issue is necessarily the right place to argue against the well established paradigm of member enumeration; it's been around for a long time now, and this issue is about bringing nonconformant parts of PS into line such that they behave as one might expect compared to alternate but generally equivalent methods.\r\n\r\nIf you had a list of lists, the member enumeration would generally be non functional. Since the top level list has all the properties that the second-level lists do, it would mask all their properties. Items stored in each of the second level lists would be masked from normal member enumeration until you start unwrapping the top level collection, e.g., with a pipeline.\r\n\r\n",
