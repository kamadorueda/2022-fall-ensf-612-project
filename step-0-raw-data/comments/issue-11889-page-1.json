    "body": "@vexx32, the potential benefit is in overcoming the following limitations of current `--%` syntax (I'm not advocating for the change, just providing background information; to me, the only truly problematic limitation is the redirection case).\r\n\r\n* You cannot use redirections  such as `> out.txt` - they are passed as _literal arguments_ to the target program (if the target program happens to be a shell, _it_ would interpret it).\r\n* You cannot enclose the command line in `(...)` - because the closing `)` is interpreted as a literal part of the command line.\r\n* (As implied in the OP) You cannot follow the command line with `;` and another statement - because the `;` is interpreted as a literal part of the command line.\r\n* You cannot use `--%` inside a _single-line_ script block - because the closing `}` is interpreted as a literal part of the command line.\r\n",
