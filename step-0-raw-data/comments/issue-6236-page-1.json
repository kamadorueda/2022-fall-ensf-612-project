    "body": "@tylerl0706 Settings in `System.Net.ServicePointManager` affect several APIs in .NET at the appdomain level. When you set `ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol` to `SslProtocols.Tls12` that means that those APIs will ONLY work with TLS 1.2. In PowerShell, the largest affect is on `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invok-RestMethod`. With the original change, if I ran `Start-PSBootStrap` in my PowerShell session, I would break my ability access sites that still operate on TLS 1.0. I wouldn't have a clue as to why they stopped working. My change takes the existing `ServicePointManager.SecurityProtocol` and ensures that `SslProtocols.Tls12`  is added to it. This effectively switches on TLS 1.2 without disabling any of the current Settings. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in my profile I have this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols]::Tls12 -bor [System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols]::Tls11\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis turns on TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 as I work with several APIs that are TLS 1.1 or 1.2 only.\r\n\r\nRunning this\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols]::Tls12\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould have no affect on my current settings. but running\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Security.Authentication.SslProtocols]::Tls12\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould break all of my TLS 1.1 APIs for the current PowerShell Session.\r\n\r\nDoes that answer your question?\r\n",
