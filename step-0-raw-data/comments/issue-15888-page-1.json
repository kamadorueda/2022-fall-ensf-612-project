    "body": "See also #15889.\r\nThe reason I have to deal with this is that I am currently writing scanner/lexer/tokenizer for command line call strings - for raw input as well as the pre-scanned ARGV. This requires to process the strings exactly - for bash/sh/ksh + PowerShell + DOS/cmd.exe - each with it's own domain of course.\r\n\r\nThe differently quoted strings are scanned on the first view as three separate string tokens, but they miss a SEPARATOR. The \"outer\" quotes of a string are commonly dropped from a parsed command line string as these are temporary markers grouping the characters into a string. This would result in three concatenated strings with dropped temporary markers - the quotes. Thus as expected a single concatenated string argument - ARGV entry.\r\n\r\nThe same example for Posix based shells - bash/sh/ksh. for WSL/Linux:\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\test>wsl python -c \"import sys;print(sys.argv[1:])\" \"a\"'b'\"c\"\r\n['abc']\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\test>\r\n```\r\nand for native Linux:\r\n```\r\ntest:~$ python -c \"import sys;print(sys.argv[1:])\" \"a\"'b'\"c\"\r\n['abc']\r\ntest:~$ \r\n```\r\n",
