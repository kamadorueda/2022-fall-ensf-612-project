    "body": "I misunderstood the original intent of this PR, apologies (reading too fast).\r\n\r\n@PowerShell/powershell-committee discussion on this was interesting.\r\n\r\nFirst, it looks like `Start-Process -UseNewEnvironment` on Windows gives the equivalent of a fresh login (i.e. Machine and User variables as they're stored in the registry). \r\n\r\nAdditionally, this caching behavior can be somewhat non-deterministic when I'm executed from multiple shells. For instance, I could:\r\n\r\n1. start my login shell as Bash\r\n1. modify my environment\r\n1. start pwsh\r\n1. modify my environment\r\n1. start pwsh\r\n1. modify my environment\r\n1. `Start-Process -UseNewEnvironment pwsh`\r\n\r\nI'm now getting the modified state post-step 4 instead of the original login shell environment post-step 1 (as I'd expect to get on Windows today). \r\n\r\nTherefore, we think the behavior that folks would expect from this is to get the login shell behavior with `-UseNewEnvironment`. On Linux, this would match @rjmholt 's behavior for `pwsh -l` where we use `sh -l` on Linux and `zsh -l` on macOS each in conjunction with `-c export` to retrieve explicitly and only the exported environment variables from the login shell invocation. \r\n\r\nIf you disagree, can you help us understand a scenario where you'd actually want the exact environment state from two shells up your stack?

To load a user's profile, call the `LoadUserProfile` function.\r\n\r\n  * @SteveL-MSFT just posted a thought at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4671#issuecomment-543346250:\r\n\r\n> on Windows, the current code clears the env block, then fills it from the system profile (hence username is system) and then the user profile overwriting any that exist in the system. Hence Path is incomplete. It seems the fix here is to merge Path (append user PATH to end of machine PATH). USERNAME should be special cased to the user. \r\n\r\n* Unix-like platforms:\r\n\r\n  * macOS: A login-shell like environment seems appropriate - but the CLI's `-l` workaround (launching via a hidden `sh` instance) is not really an option here; not sure how to get the right environment directly.\r\n\r\n  * Linux: ? (No personal knowledge - no need for a _login_ shell) \r\n\r\n",
