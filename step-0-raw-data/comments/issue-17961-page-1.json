    "body": "> I tracked it down to `ConsoleHostUserInterfacePromptForChoice.cs:437`\r\n\r\nAnything which uses relies on names of of console colours is going to hit a problem\r\n\r\nThe console defines 16 slots for RGB values and gives them names.  But there is no guarantee that the RGB values will match the names. For PowerShell.exe _in the default console host_ the 6th slot \"Dark magenta\" is  redefine as \"PowerShell Blue\" and the 7th \"Dark yellow\" as ~90% bright grey, and the terminal is told to use those two as background and foreground respectively. (Which we see in host.ui.rawui )\r\n\r\nIn _Windows Terminal_  (and IIRC VS Code)  you can change the background and/or foreground colours and they replace whatever is defined for Slot 0 (conventionally black) and slot 8 (console naming makes this the lighter of two \"grays\".  ANSI naming makes this the darker of two \"whites\". ) \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/186855679-34c89975-1d36-4786-9aa6-645a3f3850b0.png)\r\n\r\nAnything that says \"The background is black, therefore yellow and white give good contrast\" may **fail when the RGB values for different colours are redefined.**  To cope with this I think we need a setting for PromptColor and PromptDefault colour. And the logical thing to do is to put it in PSStyle \r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nIncidentally an ansi code like  ``` `e[40m ``` for \"Background black\" is NOT RGB 0,0,0 it is \"Console colour 0\" \r\nAnd anything which assumes the ansi codes for black and gray  will give the background and foreground colours will also fail in the old style console host **if** it has been told to use other colours slots e.g. run PowerShell.exe. or copies PowerShell settings to apply to pwsh  (they're in Computer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Console\\%SystemRoot%_System32_WindowsPowerShell_v1.0_powershell.exe)\r\n\r\nBelow I launched pwsh from Windows PowerShell, and you can see black isn't the background, magenta isn't dark magenta, but background blue, and yellow isn't dark yellow but white\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/186864358-b7b14687-73b0-4cc3-94fe-be8733bfffd0.png)\r\n\r\nTo work reliably something which wants to use the background and foreground colours needs to get them via $host, when it gets \"DarkMagenta\" it needs to translate that to the right ANSI code. (Which means dealing with console colours using DarkX and X and ANSI using X and BrightX) ",
