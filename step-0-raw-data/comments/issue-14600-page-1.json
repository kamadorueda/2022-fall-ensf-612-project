    "body": "A small note: IIRC compatibility mode uses implicit remoting and when we remote, we don't bring the formatting XML across because it can contain scriptblocks which opens up the possibility of code injection attacks. In this case, since we trust both ends, we could special case the scenario but we'd have to be careful not to break security for the general case. Another potential issue is that any code that is brought across could fail since it may depend on types that aren't present. ",

It would have been nice had they all been signed. \r\n\r\nHaving worked with many of the modules, I've seen no issues with importing the XML with respect to non-existent types. Of \r\ncourse that is not to say there isn't any.\r\n\r\nAnd to mitigate the risk, what about a ``-ImportFormatXML`` switch to ``Import-Module``? By default, no xml gets imported, but if the switch is set, then it would be. That would let the user decide.\r\n\r\n",
