This would also work on Windows \n- Another option is to change the current error thrown when a trailing `&` is used to tell the user to use Start-Process/`start`. This would also work on Windows.\n\nIn the event that the uncosted work is too expensive, would either of these alternatives be acceptable for an MVP? \n",

    "body": "Hah... I remember a couple of years ago trying to see how this kind of thing could be hacked into v2 - it's a little tricky it seems to be consistent about this given that cmdlets are inproc and stuff like the gnu utils run out of process. That's not the say there might not be a away to manage both styles of commands with a trailing ampersand. \n\nWhat I took out of my tinkering was that to support emulation of bg/fg, you'd have to implement a way to detach busy runspaces from the host UI, effectively letting them buffer into their streams collections (debug, verbose, warning, error, output etc.) until reattached. Wrap detached runspaces up as Jobs, and allow enumeration of them via a jobsourceadapter. The unix equivalent command for showing bg procs is \"jobs\" which also could alias to get-job. A detached runspace might host a native binary (out of proc) or an inproc (cmdlet) running in a pipeline and when I say native binary, I'm generally thinking about text-emitting commands rather than GUI-mode binaries (which I think on windows powershell should always run asynchronously by default.)\n\nWith respect to on-demand suspending with ctrl+z, I think this could be emulated with a global hook on windows or some kind of watchdog thread, but I think due to the lack of sighup, windows bg'd runspaces would not suspend, but instead go straight into the background. I think this is a tolerable difference. Thread.Suspend is obsolete and non-deterministic/passive anyway from a job-control perspective - you've no idea when a child thread might be ready to yield. \n\nI'd imagine that the trailing ampersand token may well just be handled with a parser hack or some extension to psreadline's line parsing, but the latter wouldn't handle ampersands in scripts, but it might be a good first stab for prototyping (e.g. only support interactive fg/fg/&) \n",
