    "body": "@kvprasoon Of the three errors, I think the last failure may be expected based on how your test is written.\r\n\r\nWhen you create a new service with a `$null` display name, the display name gets assigned the value in the name field. If you look at the error output, it indicates you're checking if the display name is `$null` and that fails because the actual value of the display name is the service name value. You'll have to update your Pester test for display name to ensure that it checks against the value of the name property if the display name is `$null`.\r\n\r\nFor the first two errors, they indicate that the display name is null when it is not. I wonder if there is a timing issue (i.e. I wonder if the service display name property value does not show up immediately after creating the service). You should try creating some services outside of Pester, show their properties when the new service objects come back, then invoke Get-Service to get the services, and see if the properties are set the way you expect as well. Plus, experiment with timing of those a bit.",
