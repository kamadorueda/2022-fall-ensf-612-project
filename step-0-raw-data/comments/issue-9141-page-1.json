Many apps (Chrome, VSCode) handle their own notification to the user that an update is available.  `Update-PowerShell` is a bit more complicated particularly on Windows where open files can't be overwritten although it's possible to download it to a known location and on startup install it (using a helper process) if it's detected.",

If so, waiting until that is implemented could provide context for how many people are not updating, to see if this is a problem which needs solving. I feel that people who download PowerShell Core from a zip/tgz are the sort of people who will be able to update when they want to, or will know that they don't want to.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, an opt-in mailing list \"tell me when there are updates\" on the download page, could be less effort (assuming Microsoft has existing mailing list infrastructure), and could indicate how much demand there is for knowing about new versions. I feel that people who download PowerShell zip/tgz are more likely to know about 3rd party package managers on Windows than the general population.\r\n\r\nNote that Chrome installs a service, getting update approval once, and never prompting again. I think it only prompts if you leave the browser open for a long time, but if you close/open it regularly, the updates just happen. If there is going to be effort into an update mechanism, could that \"ask once, do it for me\" be an option for an MSI install?",
