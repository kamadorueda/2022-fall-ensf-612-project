    "body": "> As you can see the output of $Result is the same but the method of access is different I agree there is a way to gather data from the named group using the first method but as the subject says the method is not consistent.\r\n\r\nIt is in the same way that `1` has the same output as `1, 2, 3`.  When an object that can be enumerated (e.g. `array`/`object[]`/`ArrayList`/`List<>`) is outputted to the pipeline (in this case implicitly to the host), the object is enumerated and items contents are displayed instead.  You can check this with the `GetType()` method that is present on all objects:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$result.GetType()\r\n\r\n# vs\r\n\r\n$result.Matches.GetType()\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt *is* technically consistent with how the language works, but it is admittedly pretty confusing. I absolutely remember getting tripped up on this early on (which is why I jumped on the issue) and have seen the same confusion in others many times.  This API in particular makes that interaction makes it really easy to trip on.  Not sure what would be done differently though, or if that's just gotta be one of those things that folks run into.\r\n\r\n> Using Measure-Command the time taken is considerable less using the second method:\r\n\r\nThat's pretty much always going to be the case.  Commands have a lot more overhead involved than a simple method invocation.  Honestly less than 1ms difference is pretty good, I'd have expected the difference to be more drastic.",
