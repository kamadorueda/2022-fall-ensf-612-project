    "body": "The Engine WG discussed this today.  We think having a way to interrogate the host startup parameters more directly is a good idea.  Perhaps something like a `$PSInvocation` variable or perhaps more data hung off of `$Host`.  Which brings up a point the WG discussed.  Thought needs to be put into the implementation in terms of whether this information is provided by the `host` (not all hosts support interactive and/or login features) or by the `engine`.  Given this, we're putting this `up-for-grabs`.  We also recommend that anyone attempting to implement this, write an RFC before spending a lot of time on the implementation in order to address the `host` vs `engine` issue.",
