    "body": "For Windows PowerShell, those settings aren't set to be preserved and no plans to change.  For PSCore6, I would expect the shortcut settings to be preserved since it's not part of Windows.  As @markekraus provided, a better option might be to set it in your profile.  Something I've seen people do is have a line in their profile which actually points to a profile stored in the cloud (OneDrive, Azure blob, whatever), then you can have a \"roaming\" profile where every machine you're on has the same profile (not useful unless you use different machines)",
