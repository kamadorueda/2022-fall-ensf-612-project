There are many files in the world that are process in this way by cmd.exe FOR loops.\r\n\r\nWRT @mklement0's comment about unconditional striping from a -CommentChar, that could be a limitation of the mechanism. I am not sure as to the difficulty of parsing quoted text since I would not call myself a language guy. I would think that it is well-known.\r\n\r\nWhat would doing \"tablular data\" mean? Are you saying that only tab-delimited files could be used?",
