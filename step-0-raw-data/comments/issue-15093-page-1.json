SI -eq (Get-Process -Id $PID).SI` presents two problems:\r\n\r\n* On _Windows_, it includes _additional_ processes that are _not_ owned by the current user.\r\n  * Conversely, as @jborean93 points out - it does _not_ include \"processes for that user that are run in a separate session (task scheduler, network logon/winrm, services)\" (see below).\r\n\r\n* On _Unix_-like platforms, it is in effect limited to the calling PowerShell session and child processes directly launched from it.\r\n\r\n_Conceptually_, what we're looking for (for `-Scope CurrentUser`)  is this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nGet-Process -IncludeUserName | ?

What I really think we should do is to fix _that_ behavior (and it looks like that code was kindly supplied above). If the username was present, then we could just `gps | ? username -eq jimtru` and be done. Also, I'm not really a fan about adding `-u` equivalent since the PS philosophy is to _not_ combine operations (`ps -u` is the combination of data acquisition and data filtering).",
