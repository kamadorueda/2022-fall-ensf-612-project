    "body": "Overall this looks up to par to me. Couple of notes:\r\n1) \"WIP\" must be removed from PR title (and corresponding checkbox in PR Checklist checked) before anybody will start in-depth review of the code. This is just this repo's process. \"WIP\" means \"code changes in PR are not complete / not ready for review\" therefore it does not make sense for people to spend time reviewing \"WIP\" PRs.\r\n2) \"Documentation needed\" is checked; in addition please follow that link and file an issue (something like \"Need to document new Update-FormatData parameters\") in [PowerShell-Docs repository](https://github.com/powershell/powershell-docs/) that links back to this PR; and add the link to that doc issue in \"Issue filed:\"\r\n3) what is meant by  \"Look into deduplicating format data entries in db.\" ?\r\n\r\nPS. Thank you for picking up this work.",
