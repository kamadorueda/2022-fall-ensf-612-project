    "body": "This is unfortunately due to the .Net Process class.  On CoreCLR, Responding doesn't exist (it's dependent on specific Windows GUI apis) so it'll always be empty.  The remoting behavior on FullCLR is entirely based on the Process class.\r\n\r\nOn both full and CoreCLR, per the documentation, CPU (which is just a formatted TotalProcessorTIme) is only supported on the local computer.  Workaround is to use Invoke-Command for remoting rather than the built in .Net remoting.  https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2761 would solve the remoting discrepancy.",
