The end result is really should it be trimming at all and if not do we have a better way to reduce the risk of having a long pipe name. This is being investigated in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/16995 and requires some pending input from the security team.\r\n\r\n> Maybe ask .Net for new public API to get the const UnixDomainSocketEndPoint.MaxPathLength\r\n\r\nIt might be possible if .NET creates some C/C++ code that does `sizeof(sockaddr_un.sun_path);` or something like that and allows .NET to retrieve that info. Personally I prefer to avoid all this complexity and just have pwsh attempt to create the pipe rather than attempting to trim it at all.
