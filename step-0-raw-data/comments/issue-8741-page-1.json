I'm assuming that custom attributes are always included in the reference assembly just in case a build tool like the C# compiler needs to see the attribute to generate correct code or check for errors.\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any build tool that needs to see PowerShell's attributes, so I would expect careful thought before blindly making these types public.\r\n\r\nMany of the names are not good public apis - they maybe sound too general, e.g.\r\n* `ArgumentToVersionTransformationAttribute` is quite specific and special w.r.t. PowerShell versions\r\n* `ValidateVariableName` is missing the `Attribute` suffix and validates in a very specific way that is not as general as the name suggests.\r\n* `ArgumentToModuleTransformationAttribute` sounds promising and useful, yet it's only used in one place in PowerShell - so maybe it's not really that useful.\r\n\r\nI wonder if `EnumMultipleTypeConverter` needs to be applied as an attribute at all - it's applied on types that are also `Flags`, so it's sort of ambiguous - should the conversion produce a single value or multiple values. If that could be removed, then maybe you can avoid exposing the `Enum*TypeConverter` types.\r\n",
