The very first VDU I used was 40 columns wide so \"40 + smiley\" is my shorthand for unusually narrow. \r\n\r\nThe original design of PowerShell set some formats which we're still using 15 years later.  I said in another thread that just because it's been in places for years doesn't mean it can't be improved. **I** think it's fine as it is, but I _would think that_ because I've grown used to it :-)     \r\nWhat the default templates should optimize for is a valid question, but I think a typical screen is at least 120 characters wide and many are heading up towards 200 using only half or 1/3 of the screen is tough to sell. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think assuming a width of 80 chars (or fewer) may also be a bad choice. \r\n\r\nI ran this to find out how wide the built in formats are \r\n```powerShell\r\nGet-FormatData | % FormatViewDefinition  | where {$_.control -is [System.Management.Automation.TableControl] } | % {$n = $_.name;  $_.control.headers | measure -sum width | select @{n='name';e={$n}}, Count, sum} | sort sum \r\n```\r\nThere are quite a few more than 80.   Usually with a format we want to keep adding information, and make columns wider so text doesn't need to wrap (which causes problems with coloration ), while cutting off the smallest number of people  with demands for excessively wide screens. It's often a compromise. \r\n\r\n",

File name varies in length, and it appears on the right so that all the columns always start in the same place, some space is pre-allocated and filename has the rest - on windows it starts at column 50  and we assume screen width is at least 51+ (longest file name.).  In other words that anyone who selects 80 columns as a width for their terminal doesn't use 30+ characters for their file names. \r\nLength can cope with files heading towards exabytes in size (but the eye finds it hard to tell if a string of numbers is 8 , 9 or 10 digits so we can't gauge file size at a glance)  Last write date will handle even the longest local date formats, both are usally wasteful of space and auto size claims back 15 or 16 characters.  \r\n\r\nFor the case where narrow terminal meets wide file name we can make fields narrower or drop them altogether, or we can use autosize to get the best compromise for the each output. But that's always going to be matter of personal choices, sending people back to the XML file. (See my Gist above for a starter file). \r\n\r\n",

I just run it on my `~/Downloads` where some folders have only files under 1K, while others have files >10GB (full memory dumps). Yeah, the name shifts around because of that, so what? I am fine with it, it's definitely better than all the wasted space.\r\n\r\nAnd I just noticed how much space is wasted by `LastWriteTime`, are the spaces between date and time to fit AM/PM? That's stupid.\r\n\r\nIs there really no more elegant way to redefine formatting of a single column other than keeping a (relatively) huge XML file in my config dir? I'd much rather do something like `$PSStyle.Formatting.Tables['FileInfo'].Columns['Length'].MinWidth = 0` instead of writing everything from scratch. ",

Data appears one by one without any noticeable delay, because autosize is on per-directory basis, that's why they may be misaligned which I said I'm completely fine.\r\n\r\nIf you have any points, please spell them out and try them yourself to see if they are actually valid instead of telling people to \"see yourself\" when there is nothing to see. It may have been the case in older PS, but is definitely not now. ",

    "body": "@jhoneill I rested it on my Windows machine and it looks like you're right - output from one folder does not appear until another one is printed, so the very last result does not appear until the command is done. Easiest to see when looking for file which appears multiple times close to each other, e.g. some built artifact in Debug/Release. Which does make sense from how the command is implemented, as it needs to be sure that the table is finished. Weird I could not see it on Ubuntu, maybe some filesystem oddity, or just other latencies influencing observation.\r\n\r\nI apologise for my tone, I am easily annoyed when people respond with \"see for yourself\" instead of providing explanation of the issue, especially stuff that may be harder to reproduce or observe. Mostly caused by people shutting down my ideas to remove sharp edges and/or improve diagnostics with \"RTFM\", or providing ugly workarounds that don't really work. I think we all sometimes lack empathy and ability to see somebody else's viewpoint, especially when vast differences in experience come to mind, and I will try to be more mindful of that myself. ",
