PowerShell has a somewhat eccentric, but long established behaviour . \r\n```\r\nPS> $x = @(@(@(\"ABC\",\"DEF\")))\r\nPS> $x.count\r\n2 \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might think `$x` would have one member, which has one member which has two members, but the inner members get promoted.   \r\n```\r\nPS>  $y = @(@(@(\"ABC\",\"DEF\",\"GHI\")),$null)\r\nPS>  $y.count\r\n2\r\n\r\nPS>  $y[0].count\r\n3\r\n```\r\nAdding a null to the topmost array keeps it as an array, but the next levels have done a similar promotion. \r\n\r\nAnd just when you think \"OK so one member arrays aren't treated as arrays at all then?\" \r\n```\r\nPS<  $z = @(123)\r\nPS>  $z.GetType()\r\n\r\nIsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType\r\n-------- -------- ----                                     --------\r\nTrue     True     Object[]                                 System.Array\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless you convert it to a Boolean - many items are always true, even if each is false, a single converts to Boolean as if it wasn't in an array.\r\n```\r\nPS>  $z -as [boolean]\r\nTrue\r\n\r\nPS>  $z = @(0)\r\nPS>  $z -as [boolean]\r\nFalse\r\n\r\nPS>  $z = @(0,0)\r\nPS>  $z -as [boolean]\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n\"Fixing\" this quirk would introduce subtle bugs into existing scripts.\r\n\r\n",
