    "body": "@iSazonov and @somescout - I've been thinking about the default sunspace - should by default Foreach -parallel use current (dirty) runspace or, by default, use default (clean) runspace.  It seems to me that as an admin, I would expect my current (dirty) runspace to be available when I use the -parallel switch.  While this makes intuitive sense for an admin - It just works - I wonder if the performance impact (which may be incurred for no real reason) have such a negative impact that admins would no longer see a benefit to -parallel. With this in mind, I tend to agree with @PaulHigin that the sunspace is clean.  Thoughts?",

Other issues aside, not being able to use the working runspace is worse than having to be aware of edge cases where it might be unsafe/unreliable. In most cases, especially when the user is aware of the caveats, the benefits would far outweigh the downsides. Thanks for reading.",

    "body": "> @iSazonov and @somescout - I've been thinking about the default sunspace - should by default Foreach -parallel use current (dirty) runspace or, by default, use default (clean) runspace. It seems to me that as an admin, I would expect my current (dirty) runspace to be available when I use the -parallel switch. While this makes intuitive sense for an admin - It just works - I wonder if the performance impact (which may be incurred for no real reason) have such a negative impact that admins would no longer see a benefit to -parallel. With this in mind, I tend to agree with @PaulHigin that the sunspace is clean. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nAs another admin, I also expect my runspace to be (very) dirty. And while I love performance just as much as the next admin (I mean it, please don't stop optimising for performance!), I've noticed parallelisation performance concerns around these parts tend to be significantly exaggerated (I've personally found it to be incredibly fast in basically all my admin-y scenarios, despite the abundance of caution stated [that the man himself](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-foreach-object-parallel-feature) would have you believe. @PaulHigin, you don't give yourself enough credit for your amazing work!).\r\n\r\nThese days NVMe SSD's are ubiquitous and we have more cores/threads than we know what to do with. What kind of real-world performance hits are we actually talking about in each given scenario? The hits would have to be galactic in impact to have me switching away from parallelisation when I'm applying WSUS patches to computers across my domain that can take an hour to apply (and yes, I use parallelisation for very small things too, it's equally awesome). \r\n\r\nWith regard to the opt-in/opt-out debate, when I'm solving a problem, the priority order is as follows: Efficacy > Reliability > Performance, not the other way around. I want to build an effective solution as simply as possible, _then_ I will mess about with performance and other aspects if necessary. Therefore, assuming performance isn't genuinely crippled, I do hope end-user simplicity prevails and we opt for an opt-out approach, if possible. ",
