    "body": "The **problem** stems from the fact that **the shortcut that you're trying to modify is located in a folder that requires _elevation_ (running as an administrator) in order to write to it** (`\"$env:ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\PowerShell\"`).\r\n\r\nIn other words: this is a permissions problem, but the error message is woefully inadequate.\r\n\r\nNote that the issue only occurs if you launch PS Core from the _Start Menu_.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for **workarounds**:\r\n\r\nIf you copy the shortcut file (`*.lnk` file) to a user location, the problem goes away, and this can be done _implicitly_:\r\n\r\n* Either:  Launch PS Core via the Start Menu, pin it to the Task Bar, and launch PS Core from there in the future.\r\n\r\n* Or: Drag the PS Core shortcut file from the Start Menu to your Desktop, for instance, and launch PS Core from there in the future.\r\n\r\nFuture windows launched this way will _not_ exhibit the problem, because their originating shortcut is now in a location that even your non-elevated processes can write to.\r\n\r\nAn ad-hoc alternative is to stick with the Start Menu shortcut, but invoke it _as an administrator_ in order to change the window properties (right-click on the icon in the Start Menu and select `Run as Administrator`) - but note you'll have to do that _every time_ you want to make changes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for **what needs fixing**:\r\n\r\n* The PowerShell installer could create a _per-user_ Start Menu shortcut for PS Core instead of a single, shared one that requires elevation to modify (as an aside, if multiple users try to customize the shortcut, the customizations could collide).\r\n\r\n  * This is how `cmd.exe` already does it for its `Command Prompt` shortcut, which is placed in `\"$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\System Tools\"` - for every user.\r\n\r\n* The Windows (GUI) Shell should improve the wording of the error message - not sure where to report that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
