    "body": "> Measure-Command could potentially implement some degree of the functionality present in BenchmarkDotNet\r\n\r\nYou mix microbenchmaring and profiling - it is different approaches. I think it is impossible to implement microbenchmaring on PowerShell language because every command (cmdlet, operator) involves full engine. So we could say about `profiler`. I remember that @daxian-dbw has a great desire to work on it, but it is unlikely that something is progressing there due to lack of free time.",
