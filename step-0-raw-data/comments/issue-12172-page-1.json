Essentially it seems like if you call `Get-WmiObject` in PS7, currently it uses the Windows PowerShell compatibility remoting session to load the relevant Windows PowerShell module.\r\n\r\nIt also (erroneously) clobbers the already imported or otherwise available cmdlets from the PS7 module like Get-Location / Get-ChildItem / etc which are shadowed by the auto-generated functions that operate with the compatibility remoting.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we get some rather broken behaviour. I think @PaulHigin was notified and may be working on a fix.\r\n\r\nFunctionally speaking, this is a duplicate of #12014 🙂 ",
