Interestingly this one doesn't work in Windows PowerShell 5.1 either.\r\n\r\nWindows PowerShell 5.1 did have support for hex literals as well as KB/MB/GB/... suffixes, but not binary literals. So it doesn't really make sense to me why `0GB.ps1` works in neither Windows PS 5.1 nor PS7, but `0x.ps1` works in Windows PS 5.1 but not PS7. `0.ps1` on the other hand works on both versions. `0b1.ps1` works in Windows PowerShell 5.1 but not PS7.\r\n\r\nI think it would be nice if there was some consistency in the handling of number literals so as to minimize surprise, particularly in light of the other examples I posted above.\r\nFor a command line interpreter, I would generally expect (existing) file names to have precedence over accessing properties of some - but not all - number literals.",

Yeah, I agree, the fact that certain literals aren't affected, especially binary (which has a similar prefix) seems to suggest that the hex tokenization is subtly broken.\r\n\r\nHard to say exactly how without a deep dive though, but I do agree this could and should be fixed.",

I believe we rely on BigInteger's hexadecimal parsing, which parses as signed hexadecimal by default. Prefixing the `0` forces it to parse as effectively unsigned, or something like that.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the following `if (sb.Length == 0)` check will never be hit, it will always have at least length 1. This issue should be resolved if we update that check on line 3987 to `if (sb.Length == 1)`. Probably worth adding a comment explaining why the check must differ from the binary one not far below.",
