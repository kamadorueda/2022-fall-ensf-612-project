    "body": "We've already removed Pester as part of PSCore6 package, but we've been discussing internally about removing Pester 3.4 from Windows PowerShell.  We originally made the decision to ship Pester inbox in Windows to help build a community around a common test framework for PowerShell as well as encourage more testing in general.  I believe we've succeeded in that effort so there's no longer a requirement to ship Pester inbox and it makes sense for users to be accustomed to getting the latest Pester from PSGallery.\r\n\r\nA less desired option is to update the inbox version of Pester to 4.x.  This is problematic for two main reasons:\r\n\r\n1. 4.x is not backwards compatible with 3.4 so it's a breaking change\r\n2. There's a ton of process work to ship the new version in Windows\r\n\r\nI'd like to get some community feedback on this.  Keeping Pester 3.4 is not an option as it's only getting more and more out of date.",

Removing Pester is a breaking change. \r\n\r\nMy preference would be that it not ship with Windows PowerShell instead of shipping a Pester 4.0 I can't easily downgrade from.

I'm actually dealing with a situation where we're slightly locked into the old version -- partly because it's preinstalled, and taking a dependency on the new version in one of our modules seems like it would break installing that module.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to ask whether we're establishing a precedent. Will you apply the same logic to PSReadLine? Not having _that_ preinstalled would be more painful.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there could be a meta-module that takes dependencies on those so that people could just `Install-Module WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityPack` and it would install those modules to preserve compatibility? And then 😉 I find myself wondering whether that module would install the _latest_ or the original, fully-compatible version 😕. But in either case, at least the modules would get installed, and they'd be upgradable with PowerShellGet\r\n\r\n",

At various stages in the process I run Pester tests to look for common misconfigurations that we've experienced and to validate that hardening (such as SSL cipher disablement) is in place and a ton of other things.  Before this was all done with monkey testing (Click-Next) and many times things were missed.  Now when the automation runs I am 95% sure that the image creation automation was done correctly.  The pester tests also work without modification with Server Core 2012 R2 and 2016 - where there is no GUI to click-next test on.",

The adoption of Pester would improve since the framework was already present (and signed by Microsoft) and it was more \"safe\" to use without the need for a security review that might be needed by companies when downloading something from PowerShell Gallery. Removing it would be a major breaking change - adding the new one would be a breaking change in certain scenarios. If we could remove or add the new one with the next version (build) of Windows then that breaking change, either removing or changing version, would not have as much of impact - going to that build would be more of a breaking change than which Pester version is used. If we talking about installing an optional update for WMF 5.x and Pester would be removed, then that is up to each IT-department to evaluate the impact of installing an update. It we are talking of doing this in a non-optional update (like security update), then that's worse... we shouldn't do that - scripts could break.",
