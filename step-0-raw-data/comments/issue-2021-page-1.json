    "body": "This brings an issue when running PowerShell 6 in side by side mode on windows due to the fact that this would require a change to PSModulePath for the modules to be found by Get-Module -ListAvailable\n\nTake this example \n\nI install modules from the PowerShell Gallery when running PowerShell v 5.1 (Windows 10 AU +) which installs the module to C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules which is a path in my PSModulePath Environment Variable\n\nNow when I load Powershell 6x it will be able to find modules in that path which _I do not want_\nSo to get round this I have to enforce that PSModulePath only has the C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\Modules location defined as not to load any modules that require the full .NET framework.\n\nSo I would be suggestive of a breaking change for PowerShell Core and implement a completely new PSCoreModulePath env variable which would allow co-existence to occur with no issues to the underlying WindowsPowerShell install on a machine.\n",
