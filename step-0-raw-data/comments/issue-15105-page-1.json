    "body": "> * `InvokeWithContext()`, which allows passing in custom function and variable contexts, but it's not straightforward (possible?) to choose which runspace it's run on and it doesn't interact well with a `PowerShell` object\r\n\r\nI think part of what makes it feasible for one and not the other is that these API's represent fundamentally different things. `PowerShell` is more or less just a friendly wrapper around `PipelineProcessor` and `CommandProcessor` where the `ScriptBlock` API represents a single anonymous command.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you were able to include context, where would it be defined? With `InvokeWithContext` you create a new scope, dump the state, and then it's automatically cleaned up when no longer in scope.  With `PowerShell`, would you define it in whatever the current scope is? Or would you attach it to `Add(Script|Command)`?\r\n\r\nFrom an implementation standpoint, the code path would probably need to change drastically.  Right now it's pretty close to a normal invocation, but afaik it would not have a way to pass state to the underlying `CommandProcessor`.  It may need to take a similar route that the `ScriptBlock.InvokeWithPipeImpl` API does which has a lot of performance issues and limitations.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPart of me wishes there was some ability to control scopes.  Something like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing var pwsh = PowerShell.Create(RunspaceMode.CurrentRunspace);\r\npwsh.PushScope()\r\n    .AddFunction(name, body)\r\n    .AddVariable(name, value)\r\n    .AddCommand(\"Invoke-MyThing\")\r\n    .PopScope();\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've wanted that for a while (probably a different design) but I'm unsure if it's worth it.\r\n\r\n- Scopes have mainly been an almost completely private implementation detail, with the exception of a few \"do or don't make a scope\" parameters\r\n- Modules greatly complicate that.  You'd potentially need to add a `PSModuleInfo` or `SessionState` parameter to `(Push|Pop)Scope`",
