When you want to ensure a _known_ set of properties are all present on all objects, you just run through Select -property a,b,.y,z . \r\nThe use case is (surely?) that the properties can't be known in advance, but you want to see all of them where they exist.

Besides, `Select-Object` has already a similar output if you define the properties yourself, like `...  | Select-Object one, two, three, four` (this is also supported by the fact that the prototype already uses the `Select-Object` cmdlet) , it just needs to automatically figure out what properties are used.\r\n\r\n> even though the collect-all-input-up-front behavior is a departure\r\n\r\nSome of the existing parameters of the `Select-Object` cmdlet already doing this like `-Last <int>` (e.g. `-Last 1000` for less objects) and (unexpected, see: #11221) `-Unique`",

In general, it is not uncommon for parameter names to use verbs (`-Wait`, `-Skip`, `-Force`, ...), if that is your concern.\r\n\r\nAnd to be clear: I'm fine with adding this to `Select-Object`, and the collect-all-input-first is just a matter of documenting it properly. \r\n\r\nIf `-Last` really currently collects all input up front, it amounts to an inefficient implementation that should be changed in favor of a queue of the specified length, so that only the most recent N input objects are retained on an ongoing basis. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, `-Unique` only needs to retain the _unique_ input objects - though, _depending on the input_, that may be all of them.\r\n\r\nTo put it differently: cmdlets that for conceptual reasons must defer pipeline output until their `end` block is processed may need to _look_ at all input objects first, but they don't have to necessarily _collect_ them _all_, whereas the feature we're discussing here does.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

That might be a better place to make the change than in Select-Object (but the cmdlet isn't the only thing that uses the table formatter so that might be more of an engine thing) \r\nI can see an argument for doing it in `Select-object` -  that it is a common enough requirement that it should be in the core product, and I can see the arguments against: (a) it isn't hard to solve , and (b) it changes how select object works (storing objects rather and emitting them all at the end). (c) It's a formatting thing so any work should really be in the formatting engine. \r\n \r\n> But if I choke the pipeline and load everything in memory by using the [grouping operator `( )`]> \r\n> ```powershell\r\n> ([pscustomobject]@{name='joe';address='home'}, [pscustomobject]@{phone='1'})\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> or assign the complete array to a variable:\r\n\r\nThose things _still_ send a set of objects down the pipeline with no destination so they go through the formatter and plop out on the console.

    "body": "@iRon7  strictly it isn't any command. And I was responding to some sloppy wording: all output goes down the PowerShell pipeline.  You can write to host or verbose or error but that's not output. \r\n\r\nMany commands assume that all objects the receive will be of the same type Something like ConvertTO-Csv does it. Export-Excel (which I worked on) does it - and Doug Finke wrote something to do this job there too.  If you want to write a header with property types (excel, csv, but not JSON for example), then you have two options, either assume identical objects, write the header based on the first and carry on from there, which is typically faster and can move items on to the next step as they are ready. \r\nor wait until you have the last object, look at all the properties of all the objects to see if there are any new ones, and then output all the columns.  I don't think you're going to get everything to work this way by default. So you're back to putting a unify command in before the one which makes the assumptions  ",

Nevertheless, they prototype I created appears to work quiet well the way I imaging it to work by default:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nclass Unify : System.Collections.Generic.List[PSObject] {\r\n    Unify([Object[]]$Objects) {\r\n        ForEach($Object in $Objects) {\r\n            $This.Add($Object)\r\n            if ($Object -isnot [String]) {\r\n                $Object.PSObject.Properties.Name.ForEach{ \r\n                    $This |Add-Member -MemberType ScriptProperty -Name $_ -Value {} -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Unify]([pscustomobject]@{name='joe';address='home'}, [pscustomobject]@{phone='1'}) |% { $_ }\r\n\r\nname address phone\r\n---- ------- -----\r\njoe  home\r\n             1\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if PowerShell would be able to align (unify) the properties of each object by default at moment it unrolls an (in-memory) array into a pipeline similar what the above class does (at construction).\r\nNote that the individual items should still have only their own properties, e.g.:\r\n```PowerShell \r\n([Unify]([pscustomobject]@{name='joe';address='home'}, [pscustomobject]@{phone='1'}))[1]\r\n\r\nphone\r\n-----\r\n1\r\n\r\n([Unify]([pscustomobject]@{name='joe';address='home'}, [pscustomobject]@{phone='1'}))[0..1]\r\n\r\nname address phone\r\n---- ------- -----\r\njoe  home\r\n             1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
