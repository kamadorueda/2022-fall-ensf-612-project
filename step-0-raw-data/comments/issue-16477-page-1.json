    "body": "The way this is working is that you are calling `Get-ChildItem -Path /windows/*.dll -Recurse` and it will first enumerate the \"children\" of files matching your wildcard, i.e. `*.dll` in that directory. Each of these objects will be files with nothing to recurse into. What you want to do is\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Path /windows -Include *.dll -Name -Recurse\r\n````\r\n\r\nThe `-Include` option is also part of an example to get some more information https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-childitem?view=powershell-7.2#example-4--get-child-items-using-the-include-parameter. ~Technically `-Filter` will be more efficient for Windows file systems but it doesn't work well with `-Recurse` so I wouldn't recommend it here.~\r\n\r\nEdit: `-Filter` does work here, not sure what I was testing at the time.",
