    "body": "Follow-up:\r\n\r\nThis seems to be tied to `\\\\?\\` long path support in PowerShell 7.  In the example (pulled from my code) I attempt to Set-ACL.  The first time with the long path prefix - takes 3 minutes.  The second, without the prefix, happens instantly.   As most users will be running \"legacy\" scripts - many supporting long path / max_path PowerShell should consistently support the prefix.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96395010/166929600-3f48070f-1067-4529-9f80-22ae2fc1726b.png)\r\n\r\nI should mention that the delay only seems to affect folder ACL, not files - go figure.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\njbw\r\n",
