    "body": "Yes, I agree that this definitely needs tweaking.\r\nBut I've always also found it annoying that `Get-Command` returns an error if nothing was found (yes, I had to write similar code to yours before as well....). It would be a breaking change but in an ideal world the command should just return nothing and the caller can then write conditional logic.\r\nWhat annoys me about Get-Command as well is that it loads the module into memory by doing a full Import-Module (which makes this check very expensive). For a binary module this means I am stuck with that loaded version since PS cannot unload it (maybe that is possible with recent additions in .Net Core?).\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid breaking changes, what about a more lightweight and user friendly Test-Command cmdlet?",

Which means they don't carry over to anyone using a non-default host.\r\n\r\nI have a PR #9115  WIP that addresses this, pulls it all out and puts suggestions into a property of the ErrorRecord class with a new data type, which can then be displayed by formatters instead and is accessible to module authors. Got stuck on a few bits and pieces and CI errors that I couldn't make sense of. I'll revisit once I'm done working on Test-Connection and see if I can get it properly up to scratch. 🙂 \r\n\r\nOr, if one of you folks wants to take a stab at it, you're more than welcome to check it out, add comments, and/or just grab what you need (if anything) and take over as I may or may not have enough spare time to get it done by PS7 (and I'd _really_ like this to be squared away by PS7, but then there are a lot of things I'd like to get done for PS7 hah!)",

It's inaccessible and host-specific so folks using custom hosts cannot get any benefit from it.\n- Add a property to Error record to hold suggestion(s).\n- Modify ErrorRecord formatter to show suggestions (in a different color to the usual error color display).\n\nI think the only complication I ran into was that CommandNotFoundException is a bit weird under the hood and if you're not careful you can potentially end up causing an infinite loop, though I think the code I have in my PR does successfully avoid it.\n\n",
