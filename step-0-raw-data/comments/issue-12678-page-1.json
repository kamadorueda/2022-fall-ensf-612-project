The script takes only 30-40 seconds, so as long as you are in PowerShell 7, any updates get loaded in the background.

It should be smart about telling folks what pwsh processes are running on Windows that would necessitate a reboot after install.  It should allow the user the opportunity to close those processes and then proceed.  I would expect that the script suggests exiting the current shell once the installer has started.  It could also take parameters that the installer could use (like enable remoting, add to path, etc).  It could also take a `-Silent` parameter to do a silent install - in which case perhaps the session should end (on Windows at least) to prevent a reboot being required.",

One potential problem on Windows is due to open file handles, if this cmdlet starts the MSI installer, you would have to close pwsh to update pwsh, but I think because the MSI process is a child process of pwsh, if you close pwsh, it will kill the MSI installer as well.",
