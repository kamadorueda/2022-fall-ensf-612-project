The SSH session was not using a *`-X`* or `-Y` flag.\r\n3. The first start of both new versions triggered a dialog asking me if I wanted \"desktop integration\" of the PowerShell AppImage.\r\n4. Since this Debian box did not have a monitor attached nor the SSH X-forwarding enabled, I never saw the dialog, which is a modal one.\r\n5. Hitting *`ctrl+c`* obviously killed that dialog and gave way to powershell's final startup.",
