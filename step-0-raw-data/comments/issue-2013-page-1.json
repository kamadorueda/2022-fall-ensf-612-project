If it sets MinVersion < 6.0 and does not set MaxVersionTested, do the things like it was invoked by 5.0.\n\nThe argument is that, Microsoft already does this for Windows applications (applications need a manifest to declare their support for systems with GUIDs or by default get some compat shims, like VersionLie, after 8.1, and UWPs have manifests with MaxVersionTested). This seems to be a good compat practice and it worth considering.\n\nAnd I suggest we has better not drop the “1” out of the extensions.\n",

    "body": "Jeffrey Snover explained why the .ps1 file extension was retaIned In subsequent PowerShell releases a while back. The '1' denotes the current side by side version rather than the current language version. Link and excerpt follow.\n\nhttps://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2007/11/02/ctp-versioning/\n\nPowerShell Scripts continue to use “.PS1”.\nWe will continue to pursue this approach until there is a major change in the CLR or .NET frameworks which force us to go side-by-side. It is at that point that we’ll go from .PS1 to .PS2 . Until then we will stay with .PS1 and everything that runs today will continue to run in new releases.\nYou might write a .PS1 script which takes advantage of a cmdlet/feature that is only available in V2. If you send this to someone that has PS V1, it will fail “in some way and at some time”. If it uses some new syntax, it will fail at parse time (with a PARSER error) but if it uses a new command line switch – it won’t fail until it tries to run that command. This is what #REQUIRES is all about. You start your script with \n#REQUIRES -Version 2\nAnd we will check version #’s and produce a precise error message\nIf you have a #REQUIRES –VERSION 1 in your script, it will continue to run just find on PowerShell (V2) CTP because it is compatible with V1.\n",
