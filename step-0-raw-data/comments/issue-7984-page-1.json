    "body": "Hello,\r\nI might have found a simple workaround that I've tested and it works.\r\n\r\nBasically instead of asking the don net application to call the remoting script via .AddScript method you ask the dot net app to call a local powershell process that executes the remoting script. The script file should be somewhere on the server you're executing the application from. To show this as a code I'm using the following.\r\n\r\nstring script  = \"start-process pwsh-preview\" -argument \"path to script file\"\r\nusing (Runspace runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace())\r\nusing (Powershell powershell = Powershell.Create())\r\n{\r\nrunspace.Open();\r\nPSCommand command = new PSCommand();\r\ncommand.AddScript(script);\r\n powershell.Commands = command;\r\npowerhell.Runspace = runspace;\r\nCollection<PSObject> results = new Collection<PSObject>();\r\nresults = powershell.Invoke();\r\nI'm yet to test calling the script with parameters (not sure how to do it yet maybe someone here can help). As well as hosting in docker container the entire thing. Most likely PowerShell core will need to be installed as well as dot net core in the docker image for it to work.\r\n\r\n**However the main problem where AddScript method DOES NOT EXECUTE remoting script is still there.**",
