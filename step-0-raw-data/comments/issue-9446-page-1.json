    "body": "There are a couple of issues here:\r\n\r\n1. This experimental feature attempts to batch implicit remote commands so that multiple remoting round trips do not occur, and should in general increase performance.  However, this example has only one remoting command, 'Get-User', so batching will not help here.\r\n\r\n2. Measure-Command is currently supported by batching it along with other commands to be run directly on the remote target.  But in this case the remote session is locked down and Measure-Command is not allowed, and is why you get the error.  Measure-Command is convenient but not essential in executing implicit remote commands.  You can still use this batching feature by just running allowed implicit commands, e.g., 'Get-User | Where-Object Name -eq 'User' | Remove-User'.  This will be batched if Get-User, Remove-User are implicit remoting commands and Where-Object is supported on the remote session.",
