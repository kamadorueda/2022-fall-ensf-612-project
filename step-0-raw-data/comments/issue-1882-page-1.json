    "body": "> Using fpm for rpm and .deb generation is sub optimal.\n\nTotally agree, but it was very quick to go from zero to multiple packages :wink:\n\nI'm unclear if we should own the creation of packages for distributions to release. My understanding is that _usually_ outside package maintainers pick up your build output and source, and create packages for their distribution; not pickup packages from you. However, I don't know if this is the route they'll take with PowerShell. If distributions end up wanting us to maintain the actual packages going into their repositories, we absolutely will need to create them from scratch (RPM spec etc.).\n",

It's already much better than just releasing the source code or some zipped binaries.\n\nAs for this specific issue, rebuilding on Fedora 24 with the correct requirements properly defined and a new RPM being made available through the website is all that's needed, in my opinion.\n",

A lot of convenience has been added around launching applications this way. \nHowever, for a shell, I admit that a lot more of the mentioned convenience would have to be added.\n\nI guess that's what @jrm16020's script tries to achieve.\n\nMounting the current directory into the container might not be enough. Actually, I guess that everything that is accessible (file system, internet, registry etc.) through powershell would have to be mounted into the container so that it feels like working natively.\n\nAll that said, it's probably not impossible but a lot of work is to be done, bringing all into the container.

The example that I posted above works for my use case but it's not a big deal to modify it to serve your purposes.  In your case you'd run a privileged container and mount all of your local filesystem into the container.  Your container will already have the networking capabilities that your bash/zsh/dash shell has since it's a privileged container and has access to any of the binaries of your Linux host.\n\n```\ndocker run --rm --name powershell --privileged -v /:/system -it centos/powershell /usr/bin/powershell\n```\n\n```\ndocker run --rm --name powershell --privileged -v /:/system -it centos/powershell /usr/bin/powershell\nPowerShell \nCopyright (C) 2016 Microsoft Corporation.

I'm a Fedora user and would enjoy seeing a native package as well.  That said, there are ways to get Powershell working on your system as it's currently built without depending on an RPM.  Docker is the perfect way to package software for easy consumption by all Linux distributions.  \n",

We are also using SDK built for RHEL by a RHEL developer Omair. We had to go this way, instead of bundling libicu because Fedora's policies forbid bundled libraries. (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Bundled_Libraries?rd=Packaging:Bundled_Libraries)\r\n\r\nThere was a pull request in one of the repos which fixes the libicu issue. If you download 2.0 nightly builds, libicu issue is non present. Sadly it didn't make it in 1.1.1 release. \r\n\r\nAll the code for Fedora's package is hosted here on F25 branch: http://pagure.io/fedora-dotnet\r\n\r\nPinging @omajid @tmds @rheaayase\r\n",

I believe our RPM release is working with Fedora 27?\r\n\r\nThat's not how packaging works in Linux.\r\n\r\nOpen Source products are built and packaged by package maintainers, not by the authors of the products. Yes, one may be both, but in the case of .NET Core that is in no way true. Package maintainers can make sure that said product works with all the quirks of their Linux distribution, and they have to comply with it's rules. Among the many rules of Fedora packages, one of the main ones is that the packages have to be fully built from source, including the tools used to do so. All done in Fedora, for Fedora. This way we can make sure that there is nothing spooky coming from some 3rd party binary that could cause issues or vulnerabilities, etc...\r\n\r\n.NET Core is packaged by the [Fedora .NET SIG](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SIGs/DotNet) and all the information around .NET Core in Fedora is maintained and always up to date at [fedoraloves.net](http://fedoraloves.net)\r\n\r\nOn a side note, as you can also find out on our pages, .NET Core, VSCode and other packages published by Microsoft are **not** free software, are under proprietary licenses, and contain proprietary code and libraries. We exclude these bits and pieces from our packages and provide necessary hacks to get the sh!# to work.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nNow on topic of PowerShell packages themselves, I've not looked into it so I can not tell if it's the same as the above and with the same issues. From a glance from afar, those are not Fedora packages. They're rhel packages. There **is** __major difference__, so I expect a huge load of issues.\r\n\r\n_(I'll take a closer look some time next week.)_",
