But if you want this, please open a separate issue.\r\n\r\n>  Memory usage? \r\n\r\n~That, and the fact that any extra processing is wasted processing time. It will slow down errors when most users will not care about this data. Fail-fast!~ I just realized the raw string is already there so that's not really a concern.\r\n\r\nSo, the reason for this is to not destroy the stream that is already available in the `HttpResponseMessage` so that advanced users can do with that as they please. This has no bearing on any other error related issues, just keeping the stream available instead of closing it and leaving the user with no way to access it.\r\n\r\n> backwards compatibility is the only concern?\r\n\r\nBackwards compatibility is not even a concern here at all as this would absolutely not work the same in 5.1 and 6.0.0.\r\n\r\n> Why is it stripping out the formatting?\r\n\r\nThe code comment states it's for readability. It is stripping HTML tags. Compare the following on 6.0.0 and 5.1:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\niwr https://google.com/noloexisto\r\niwr https://httpbin.org/status/418\r\n```\r\n\r\nIMO, this is an improvement (though imperfect) over 5.1\r\n\r\n> I hate the idea of having to do extra code to read the stream if the common scenario is to want that detail.\r\n\r\nIt's not common. Most users will find `ErrorDetails.Message` sufficient. This scenario addresses advanced and less common needs such as wrapping and proxying the cmdlets. This is an area where it is better to leave it up to the user to decide what they want to do with it. As far as PowerShell is concerned, an error occurred. This at least provides the user the opportunity to do something useful with the error, should they choose to and most will not.",

    "body": "@iSazonov it is definitely not an edge case. I run into this quite a bit when implementing error handling. The truth is that error bodies contain useful information and we currently mangle it with no way to retrieve the original data. While it is true that _most_ users will not run into issues with this, some _major projects_ (such as those working with Atlassian products) do. It is a problem that presents itself quite clearly to those working closely with APIs. That makes it a step above edge case.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to attack this. \r\n\r\nI have a plan floating in my head and across several issues here to add support for treating all status codes or a provided list of status code as successful. This would mean that object creation from IRM would proceed as normal and IWR would return its normal response object. This will allow users to interact with non-success messages (such as 3XX, 4XX, and 5XX responses) as if they are normal. In that scenario a module author could indicate the known error messages for the endpoint are success codes, manually check status code, and parse the output. This presents a minor problem with IRM where it is currently not possible to obtain the response code (but this could be remediated). \r\n\r\nA second option is to provide a new parameter that results in the response not being disposed when an error occurs. This would make it possible to retrieve the stream on the response object that is attached to the exception. \r\n\r\nAnother option I've considered is adding a delayed dispose where the stream is available for a period of time and then the object is disposed. I haven't looked deeply into this.. and I kind of think it is a bad idea for a ton of reasons.\r\n\r\nYet another option I have considered is allowing to a `-ErrorStreamVariable`  that accepts a string. this string is used as a variable name in the calling scope (similar to `-SessionVariable`) for a Stream object. `CoptToAsync()` is used to copy from the content to the stream, the stream is used to generate the error, and then the stream position is reset to 0. The user could then consume the stream and dispose of it at their leisure in their own code. ",

    "body": "I think -SkipHttpErrorCheck is not the right solution. Invoke-RestMethod only returns the parsed content of the response. With -SkipHttpErrorCheck we would be able to inspect the error response, but we would have no way to know it is an error response, we have no way to check the status code. One could always use Invoke-WebRequest, but then you can’t use features like -FollowRelLinks, have to content-switch and parse yourself, etc.\r\n\r\nImo especially for a high-level cmdlet like Invoke-RestMethod, it should abstract HTTP as it does already, meaning it should convert HTTP error responses into PowerShell errors.\r\n\r\nWhy can’t we expose the response content on the exception object?",

    "body": "> I don't know why you'd make that assumption.\r\n\r\nI spend a lot of time writing, consulting on, and reviewing REST wrappers created in PowerShell. Based on experience, when someone wants to perform error handling manually they almost always use the assignment paradigm. But let's not argue on that. Neither of us have time to pull stats from github and other places for that. \r\n\r\n>   .NET/C#\r\n\r\nWe are using `HttpClient`. Both `HttpClient` and `WebRequest` APIs do not throw on a non-200 status. If you look at our code, we are creating the HttpReponseException in the PowerShell code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/8bd16d13cb97ba4466b4c328a9e6d130bbf2c894/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/Common/WebRequestPSCmdlet.Common.cs#L1517\r\n\r\n> Why can't we expose the parsed contents?  Could you be more specific?  What is blocking PowerShell from exposing the parsed contents on the Exception object?\r\n\r\nThis has to do with the simplified error messages. Essentially, we can have one or the other, but not both without performance sacrifices. Also, the error handling is done in the base cmdlet class, which means it needs to behave similarly for both `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod`. Factor in binary responses, no way to ensure disposal, and that these errors accumulate in the $Error variable without falling into the garbage collector and you have a recipe for unintended performance impacts.\r\n\r\nIn 5.1 the `WebRequest` API provided a stream that could be reused. In 6.0 with the move to HttpClient the stream cannot be reused and additionally we dispose it because we have to basically duplicate it in memory to perform string processing on it to give a meaningful error.",
