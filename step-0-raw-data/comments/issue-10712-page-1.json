Use `dynamic` type. This can noticeably slow down the code.\r\n3. Use Expression.Lambda. It seems not so easy to implement.",

Most of the logic for that is already in [Where-Object](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c08c7e4714e6822029f8741c3121bb9e1c4fd2b3/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InternalCommands.cs#L1963-L1967). All that should be needed to do is replace the expression type parameter with a hard coded `ExpressionType.Add` value and use that delegate when totaling.",
