    "body": "@MartinGC94 That would limit the feature only to the particular editor. I believe that a shell language is a bit different usage, as a system admin may quickly edit a script in some basic text editor, or somebody may run couple lines of code directly from terminal, without creating a script first. Personally I was bitten by `and/or` when trying to look up some files with a `Select-Object` oneliner. If it's possible to integrate those checks into parser, I see no reason not to do it. \r\n\r\nWhat I am questioning instead is whether a single `version` setting is good enough. As we add more checks, it is more and more difficult to get them all correct. If somebody wants to use a check from version `N`, they need to first fulfill all of the previous ones. Maybe moving to a flag system would be a good idea, so that if you don't like this particular check but want to use future ones, you could just do `Set-StrictMode -Version 7 -Exclude 'OperatorPrecedence'`.",
