This is not relevant to the pull request, and honestly I don't know how it came to KDE and GTK+.\n\nIf you want KDE ported to GTK+, go ask on one of their mailing lists, I'm sure somebody else wants to do that too.\n\nThere are many open source projects that aren't \"cheap\" or \"free\" (gratis), and we certainly don't choose software because it's available at little or no cost. Windows 10 is gratis, you don't see me hopping over there.\n\nGood bye troll, I hope you enjoyed the responses thus far.\n",

That argument is essentially, \"It's good enough for me; if it isn't good enough for you, that's my problem.  Fix it yourself.  Oh, you can't?  So sad.  Maybe you shouldn't criticize 'free' when someone gives it to you!\"\n\nThat's the exact opposite of your original argument:  The Open Source philosophy is we put it out there so you can bother fixing it if it's not good enough, provided you have that capability.\n\nYou've moved goalposts and completely changed arguments, and finally fell back to well-poisoning and personal attacks.  I'm going to call ignorance over malice here:  you're not evil; you actually believe your own delusion, thus you're insane.\n\n> This is not relevant to the pull request\n\nThe original argument was yours, as a way to attack Microsoft for not following your religion.\n",

Fragmentation creates various versions of software with varying effect, ranging from following one group to actually harming the user.  LibreOffice is what's left after three forks of OpenOffice.org, and is maintained by Novel Software; CinePaint and Gimp-Photoshop are hardly-used, poorly-maintained novelties which never made a difference to upstream nor gained user traction; and libav not only shares or re-implements fixes with ffmpeg (creating two similar projects with alternate problems), but also breaks compatibility while replacing ffmpeg in some distributions, creating all kinds of headaches and decisions for the end user where a unified project would have been much more beneficial to everyone.\n\n> User can modify it to fit their need\n\nMost users don't have such skill; and even when they do, this takes a large amount of time.  At best, skilled individuals can work for the project without pay **to further their own needs, but not the needs of other users, unless those other users have similar needs**; in almost all cases (all but a few hundred out of three **billion**, or on the order of literally 99.999999997%), this is just a fluff line\n\n> User can share it with their neighbour.\n\nWe do that with freeware that doesn't have an open-source license.\n\n> User can can learn how it work.\n\nOnly if they have the time and a huge amount of domain knowledge backing it.  I've learned a lot about how Windows works without looking into it anyway; the same is true of many people who are more skilled than me and work on ReactOS.\n\nThis is, again, an ideal that doesn't reflect reality, except for a few elite people with tons of time and a high degree of existing specialized skill.\n\n> User can do anything what it want to do with it.\n\nThis is ambiguous.  The user can use the software for any purpose the software can achieve; this is approximately a property of all software.\n\n> User have Freedom to run anywhere.\n\nThis is a pricing and licensing consideration, and is valid.\n\n> User don't have to live on other mercy.\n\nThis is a meaningless statement.\n\n> User have a say\n\nThis is a meaningless statement.  I can say anything I want to Microsoft, but they don't have to listen; and most open source softwares don't listen.  Tell me why this one hasn't been taken up as an important feature for the next release:  https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/19624\n\n> User can participate in make it better\n\nWith an extremely high level of skill **and the blessing of the upstream developers**, yes; otherwise you are a voice just like you are a voice to Sun, Microsoft, or Apple.  Users who have participated in FreeBSD or ffmpeg have been banned from those projects for disagreeing with the handful of core developers, and have gone on to live in obscurity with their meaningless pet projects.\n",

Open Source Software, Free Software, and the GPL don't give the user any of those capabilities people talk about; the user gets those capabilities from:\n- Years of study in computer science and software engineering\n- Years of experience creating and maintaining complex computer programs\n- Hours of personal time sunk into understanding the code base in front of them\n- Many more hours of personal time spent modifying that code base\n\nThe community benefits are contingent on:\n- A user's ability to convince the developers to do things\n- Developer's understanding of what the users want\n- Developer's interest in an alternative that maximally-benefits the user, as opposed to a different alternative (which may be more-interesting to them personally)\n- Developer's willingness to accept provided code (e.g. pull requests)\n\nFor a fork, the benefits further depend on the maintenance of the fork--which means other people are now relying on either the forking developer to keep up with the main branch, the forked branch to draw developers off mainline (outcompete), or their own skill and effort in providing the leg work after the fork has been abandoned.\n\nThat's more philosophy than substance, and it has nothing to do with producing a product of quality.  It at best reduces one specific risk in a specific circumstance.\n\n> we use the term “Linux” to refer to the Linux kernel, but also the set of programs, tools, and services that are typically bundled together with the Linux kernel to provide all of the necessary components of a fully functional operating system. Some people, particularly members of the Free Software Foundation, refer to this collection as GNU/Linux, because many of the tools included are GNU components. However, not all Linux installations use GNU components as a part of their operating system.\n\n\"Linux is only a kernel\" vs \"Debian Linux\", \"Redhat Enterprise Linux\", and so forth.  Curl up in a little ball and whisper to yourself that the way **everyone in the world** says \"Linux\" is wrong, they're wrong, and you're the only one who isn't wrong.\n\nSo yes, we ship Gnome with Linux.\n",

Isn't that why the PATH variable exists, to make looking for software easier?\n\nSince `curl.exe` should not be used in PowerShell pipes (as it is a native tool, which outputs `string` in PowerShell, and suffer from encoding issues), the best practice is to\n\n``` PowerShell\nStart-Process curl -Arguments @(...) -RedirectStandardInput ... -RedirectStandardOutput ... -Wait -NoNewWindow;\n# Use `start` if you are in an interactive session.\n```\n\nAnd then use the output file with custom encoding/format. It is also a best practice not to use aliases in scripts, but this is not generally followed.\n",

Perhaps something should be learned from every modern shell dating back to bash..\n\nAFAIK bash doesn't do anything to the pipeline stream. It's up to each utility to understand the encoding etc (i.e., the pipe is binary). In PowerShell (till 5.0) there is not a \"raw binary\" pipeline and anything from/to a native utility is a `string`. In my experience, PowerShell does not work well with UTF8 w/o BOM.\n",

    "body": "@jpsnover I don't like the object-oriented approach when it comes to shells, and bash is the de facto standard on GNU/Linux, so I don't see a reason to switch to another shell. I am also against builtins, in bash terminology, cmdlets in PowerShell. There seem to be a lot of cmdlets in PowerShell by default. One of the major issues I have is that PowerShell doesn't support Readline, so many common key combinations will not work, not that I have tested to see that they were not implemented in another way, such as C-w killing the previous word, C-a taking you to the start of a line and C-k cutting the line past the cursor. Personal projects and personal use aside, the majority of the systems I manage are running FreeBSD. Has there been any effort to test PowerShell on FreeBSD?\n",

    "body": "@JohnMHarrisJr I hate to be that guy, but you really are missing out.  Prior to migrating to a Windows environment, I was scripting in ksh and bash on SCO, AIX, and various flavors of Linux.  It seemed really great, and I was definitely a person that thought Windows was awful, simply because of its lack of a functional shell.\n\nBut then @jpsnover came along and really did the best thing that has happened to Windows in its entire history, and created (hands down) the most powerful shell to date on any OS.  PSv1 was a little clunky, and left a lot to be desired, but once v2 came out, PS became the best scripting language/shell that there has ever been.  And really it has only become better with each iteration.\n\nNow, I totally agree if you want to tell me that there should be some plugin that allows vi style editing at the commandline, as that was definitely pretty awesome - but honestly I don't even really miss that anymore, as it is no longer muscle-memory.  But being able to pass objects through a pipeline at the command prompt, or in a script is absolutely amazing.  I administer over 700 VMs, and I can do the same actions on all of them in minutes.  I don't have to write a complex LDAP query, or regex expression to find all those computers - I just filter them based on properties of the ADComputer object sitting right there in the pipeline.  Neat!   I have thousands of databases across 100s of SQL Servers, and again, in minutes I can query all of those databases for statistics or etc., filtering again on properties of the databases themselves.  I can tell you the growth settings, sizes, number of users connected - in just a few lines of code.  I can do this across the enterprise with less key strokes than I could on one single server using T-SQL alone.  I can manage my entire VMWare environment right from Powershell.  AWS - all from Powershell.  Pretty near any vendor I have has a Powershell module of some form - and if it doesn't, it has an API - which I can either use directly in Powershell, or write a Powershell module for.  It's extensible, it's powerful, it's portable.  \n\nToday, I have about 65,000 lines of powershell code across 650 scripts.  And because it does have a lot of built-ins, I don't typically have to worry about the state of the machines I run it on.  For the most part, they have Powershell so they will run.  Now, there may be some modules like SQL server, or Active Directory that aren't always available - and for those I can create a constrained endpoint on a machine that does have those dependencies, and I can invoke those modules remotely and still get the objects back to the pipeline on my calling machine.  \n\nAnyway, off my soap box.  The fact of the matter is, it was a mistake to use curl and wget initially as aliases for a command that does not do exactly the same things with exactly the same parameters. @jpsnover has acknowledged that.  But the fact is, it happened.  And because it happened, there will be at least 1 _paying customer_ out there that has utilized those aliases in a critical script, where the author has not been with the company for 5 years, and nobody knows what the script is, what it does, or where it's running.  And if they simply remove the alias, that script will break when that customer updates, and no one will know what to do or how to fix it, all they will know is some critical thing broke.  Microsoft isn't Linux.  Its admins aren't quite as up on the DevOps movement, and so Windows admins are not purposely breaking things to see how fast they can recover, or identify the issue, etc.  A lot of admins have dinosaur applications, dinosaur scripts, and when things break they really break, and the admins are not flexible enough to identify and fix the problem.  So, MS has at least some duty to try to prevent breaking that customer, regardless of how other businesses or development teams/collaborations do it.  So they will use due diligence, come up with a plan, and it will hopefully be far better than just removing the alias and breaking things.\n",

And as I said before, thats the core of the idea and that additional details will be needed. \n\nYou can stop looking for things to correct now. You don't get any points for pointing out things that had no attempt or intent to address. This is not a discussion about the color of the bikeshed.   Note again that this was not offered as a specific solution, but the core of an idea. \n\nSince I've worked on projects that automatically edited and ported millions of lines of code, I have no fear that writing tools or scripts that perform such a change on these scripts can be done pretty easily.  \n\nHave an excellent day. \n",

As with any other service, you don't upgrade PowerShell just because. Specially in production environments. Would you upgrade mysql, redis, Node, nginx, etc without reading implications, changelog, potential drawbacks? Don't think so.\n\nIf you are involved in Windows and specifically PowerShell development, there's a good chance you found out about this over the 2, 3, 4?-month span since deprecation notice. #5, #6 and #7 should help you get the news somewhere.\n\nBut, if you want to be more conservative, maybe the switch to the \"new PowerShell behavior\" could be configured at upgrade time. Simple Yes/No dialog which can be reconfigured again later via command line, registry, whatever Windows developers like. PS should then also include a way for a script to determine if it's running in legacy aliases mode or not.\n\nOn Wed, Aug 24, 2016 at 3:39 PM, Raynor Vliegendhart <\nnotifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @luisfarzati https://github.com/luisfarzati\n> \n> No changes to your scripts, just call them with a separate command, or\n> maybe not even a command, just an argument modifier like --legacy-aliases\n> or something.\n> \n> Which means that if a script is scheduled to run somewhere, and PowerShell\n> has been updated on that machine, it could potentially break because people\n> forgot to add the new command flag?\n> \n> —\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/1901#issuecomment-242167062,\n> or mute the thread\n> https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AAGj9S8em4Sq1-i6A3mTBxgTWimRTTsJks5qjI_0gaJpZM4Jn1fs\n> .\n",

You have something that is practically as universal as `echo`, that responds differently in just **one** specific case: PowerShell.\n\nThat doesn't make any sense. Not just for *nix users, or OSS developers. It shouldn't make sense for anyone, including Windows/PS developers.\n\nThere was a time when MS did things like this all the time, remember the web?\n\nIn recent years they have shown a change of convictions and a solid commitment to the OSS community. This is one of the challenges they need to face. The right answer, not because I say so, but because they are the ones trying to amend things, is to make `wget` respond as `wget`. We all should be asking for this, hopefully _after having learned a few painful lessons in the past decade of the web_.\n\nCome on, this is not the first time a breaking change is introduced in a tool or a system and won't be the last. Breaking changes, although not frequent, are part of our challenges as developers. Mass-consumed APIs suffer from breaking changes from time to time and it's not the end of the world, specially with proper notice, feedback and community support.\n",

So the Web should be a lesson for us, but in a different way/sense.\n\nNot all users of PowerShell are part of community and you can't expect them to respond to such changes. And not to mention no one here suggesting the removal really cares about \"the serious commitment to backward compatibility.\"\n\nThe removal is possible, only if you keep these things there for all old scripts.
