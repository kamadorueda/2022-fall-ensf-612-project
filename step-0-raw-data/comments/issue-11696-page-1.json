As far as I know this would create uncompilable code.\r\n\r\nIn order to allow this, PS would have to retrieve variable values at the time the variable or function is defined, effectively defeating the purpose of doing so.\r\n\r\nI'd also generally be quite worried about any code written this way. Having functions that effectively have a fluid definition based on runtime state creates difficult to trace errors and unpredictable functions. The point of defining a function is to have a replicable block of code that always behaves the way it was originally defined.",
