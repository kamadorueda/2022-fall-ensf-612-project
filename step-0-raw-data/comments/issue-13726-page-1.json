    "body": "Thanks for the explanations, I now better understand what's happening here.\r\n\r\nI still think that `@('x', 'y')` getting converted/bound to `string` rather than to `string[]`, resulting in a \"wrong\" overload being called, could be considered a bug. Is this because `@('x', 'y')` is an `object` array in PS, so the conversion to `char` or `string` array is not possible and the default \"to string\" conversion takes place? However, the non-Core Powershell is somehow able to call one of the `Split` overloads which accept `char[]` or `string[]` - and if a call like that is possible then shouldn't one of those methods be also chosen as a better-matching overload in PS Core? Or is this a known/documented breaking change? I'd appreciate a link to the docs if so.\r\n\r\nI know that the built-in `-split` works fine, I've actually moved on to using it already, but it took me some time. I was adapting an existing script to PS Core and that change in behavior surprised me.",

    "body": "@jjanuszkiewicz\r\n\r\n> Is this because `@('x', 'y')` is an object array in PS\r\n\r\nA quick aside: Yes, PowerShell array literals are always `[object[]]`-typed, though `@(...)` isn't really an array literal, it is an - conceptually unnecessary - application of the array-subexpressions operator (even though it may get optimized away), whose purpose isn't to _create_ arrays, but to _guarantee_ that command output is an array, by wrapping a single output object in one. That said, it too always outputs `[object[]]`).\r\n\r\nIn principle, the advice from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11720#issuecomment-579866445 applies here as well; to recap:\r\n\r\n* A new overload added to a .NET method may cause the PowerShell engine to select it in situations where it previously selected a _different_ overload, due to the new overload now being a _better_ fit.\r\n\r\n* This is an _unavoidable_ consequence of PowerShell being a _late-bound_ language, and it is why you should generally prefer PowerShell-native solutions to .NET method calls (`-split` vs. `.Split()`, for instance).\r\n\r\n* The - cumbersome and possibly non-obvious - alternative is to match the method signature _precisely_, using _casts_ - only this guarantees longterm stability.\r\n\r\nHowever,  I do wonder if there are problematic overload resolution behaviors we need to address:\r\n\r\n* Generally, I don't think converting any array implicitly to `[string]` is useful in method-parameter binding - we don't even allow it in advanced functions (`function foo { [CmdletBinding()]param([string] $foo) $foo }; foo -foo one, two` fails)\r\n\r\n  * In particular, _how_ the conversion is performed is non-obvious (it's the same mechanism as in expandable strings: space-concatenated elements by default, separator configurable via `$OFS`).\r\n \r\n  * While changing that would certainly be a breaking change, I wonder how much existing code actually relies on this.\r\n\r\n* ~~In the particular case of the `String.Split()` overloads there is an oddity that I can't explain~~: notably, a `[string[]]` cast only works in the _2+_ argument form; @SeeminglyScience, perhaps you can shed some light on this:\r\n\r\n_Update_: The reason is that there's no `string[]`-_only_ overload, all such overloads have additional parameters - see [below](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13726#issuecomment-702345898).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# !! MALFUNCTIONS, despite exact type match with [string[]], still binds to the [string] overload\r\nPS> '0foo 1bar2'.Split([string[]] ('foo', '1')) # !! Same as: '0foo 1bar2'.Split('foo 1')\r\n0\r\nbar2\r\n\r\n# OK: With exact type match *and an additional argument (`options`)*\r\nPS> '0foo1bar2'.Split([string[]] ('bar', 'foo'), 'None')\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n```\r\n",
