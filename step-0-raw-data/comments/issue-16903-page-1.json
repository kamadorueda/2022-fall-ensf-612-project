Instead, it sounds from the error like WinRM remoting is being attempted on a Windows docker image that does not include WinRM (WSMan).  If so, the solution is to have a docker image that includes WSMan client.  I agree that another solution may be to use SSH remoting, but only if the docker image has SSH client.\r\n\r\nThis does not appear to be a remoting issue but a docker image issue.",
