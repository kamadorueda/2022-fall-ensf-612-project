Compare this with the (apparently) slick way that Javascript does `var m = require('mymodule')`.  Maybe we should have some way to do what DSC does but for native PowerShell. In DSC, when a module is referenced in a configuration, it's automatically downloaded and installed on the target node with no manual effort. Making critical but non-core modules available that way should eliminate the \"it should be part of core\" arguments. And for nodes that are disconnected from the net, we could have a tool that bundled the dependencies in a script into an archive which is then deployed to the target. This is how the Azure DSC resource extension works - there is a tool that scans a script to figure out the required modules then builds a zip file containing everything that is needed and publishes it to a blob. The Azure resource extension then pulls this blob, installs the modules and runs the script. ",

It's way too easy for third party developers to potentially break entire ecosystems (see https://www.theregister.co.uk/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/).\r\n\r\nBroader issues aside, there is currently no good YAML module for PowerShell, as @bergmeister pointed out. This is a must for a language which is heavily focused towards automation. YAML based configuration files are hugely popular now and it's very hard to avoid them even if you don't have to contend with the opinions of a team to do so. Think of the reasoning behind including XML and JSON as core parts of the language. The case for YAML really isn't so different.",

Some 3rd party module can become a success and mature like e.g. Pester.\r\nHowever, one should not assume that a great YAML module will evolve on its own over the next years. The reality is that most modules are published by authors who solved a particular problem and did the good deed of publishing their generic base code. This is how we ended up with 2 modules that aim to solve the same problem. Ideally one would need to merge them to focus efforts, otherwise they are going drift apart further in the future or just become stale and soon there will be more modules published by other people.\r\nThe underlying problem of having a proper parser indicates that basic (and substantial in terms of effort) ground work is needed and required to have a good YAML module.\r\nI am not a YAML expert, but is this just a problem of the loose language specification itself or specific interpretation by various systems like VSTS or AppVeyor or is this only the lack of a good parser?\r\nI found it frustrating to write YAML in VSCode and only when running it in VSTS to get an error that the VSTS parser does not like it...",

A bit like an apprenticeship/mentorship from PS team on core functionality modules.\r\nJust re-writing a new module sounds like an engineer's reaction to solve a problem which is not an engineering problem. Re-writing a YAML module is an _easy_ engineering task for the PS Team, but would not (help to) fix the community maturity problem, nor give the right incentive.\r\nWhether Yaml is the strategic item to tackle this is MSFT's call though :)",

    "body": "@bergmeister \r\n\r\nI'll preface this with myself not being a YAML expert. I happened to do some research on this when I wanted to bake some AppVeyor like yaml configs into my own franken-pipeline. I looked at how a dozen or so C# projects were consuming YAML. Since the PowerShell projects use YamlDotNet, I can only assume it's no easier. Though I have at least toyed around with both PSYaml and powershell-yaml and have looked less closely at a few PowerShell projects which use them.\r\n\r\n> I am not a YAML expert, but is this just a problem of the loose language specification itself or specific interpretation by various systems like VSTS or AppVeyor or is this only the lack of a good parser?\r\n\r\nI suspect it's the nature of YAML being readable by humans at the possible expense of being more easily readable by machines. This readability-first paradigm extends into the way YAML authors write their YAML files. Though the resulting YAML is compliant under YAML spec, it is parsed in such away as to be unusable in code without using the deserialized object as an intermediary to an actually useful object. \r\n\r\nThat is to say, that 90% of the time the deserialization from YAML to an Object is not the issue, but the data design/architecture is. The other 10% of the time _is_ parsing issues for which I can only chalk up to \"YAML is hard to parse, man.\" However, the deserialized objects are often only slightly more useful than regex-ing what you are looking for....\r\n\r\nAs an example, the secure strings in AppVeyor.yml\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nenvironment:\r\n  my_var1: value1\r\n  my_var2: value2\r\n  my_secure_var1:\r\n    secure: FW3tJ3fMncxvs58/ifSP7w==\r\n```\r\n\r\n`powershell-yaml` and `YamlDotNet` do convert this to an object, but good luck using it without a bunch of logic. Once you have that logic, good for this schema, but what about another?\r\n\r\nSome of these same data design problems plague JSON, but it is (in my experience and opinion) much easier to make models that can work around those shortcomings due to the more rigid nature of JSON. Trying to make models for any of the YAML deserializers mentioned in this thread is a nightmare if and where it is possible.\r\n\r\nGranted, models are not a feature currently available in the JSON cmdlets, though I would really like to add it. If I had a say in the \"official\" YAML module/cmdlets I would put it down as a \"must have\" feature. It is a missed opportunity especially with the addition of PowerShell classes in v5.\r\n\r\nIMO, Just getting YAML strings into an Object isn't good enough. That appears to be easy (90% of the time at least). The trick is getting YAML strings into _useful_ objects. That requires some flexibility from the solution. But that flexibility must also be somewhat approachable and not require @IISResetMe and @lzybkr there to give you serialization advice.... \r\n\r\nTo that effect, I haven't seen anything that works on a general scope. Projects adopt the solutions available, and then use their output as intermediaries for actually useful objects (leading to a bunch of wheel reinventing that probably should be baked in upstream). Or, the projects compromise YAML readability for ease of parsing from YAML to objects. ",

On this basis an effort is made to reach commercial terms with one or more community members/firms to recruit their services for a MSFT-led/facilitated development cycle to re-vamp and (in some fashion) integrate/connect the product(s).  This was done successfully with Xamarin, which kicked the project to the Net Foundation, licensed it under MIT, and recruited/contracted/involved key resources such as Miguel de Icaza and Nat Friedman via Xamarin.  Some whine that this is open source treason.  But it does create positive incentives for folks and small firms to conceive and develop projects that later could be fit for widespread adoption and integration into at least one major ecosystem.  Certainly it's preferred to jumping straight to a blank slate in-house redo that copies the whole concept and functionality and many of the ideas but jettisons the creators and (ostensibly) the code.",

    "body": "Regarding the sentiment towards keeping this out of the core feature set: there's a very significant difference in how PowerShell handles dependencies compared to, say, Ruby, Python or Node.js.\r\n\r\nEach of these languages has dependency management tools (bundler, pip, npm/yarn) which make the management of external dependencies easy and, more importantly, reproducible. Having something like a `Gemfile/Gemfile.lock` or `package.json/package-lock.json [,yarn.lock]` which makes for easy installation of all required packages and ensures that you are staying at a very specific patch level is a very significant distinction which is, in my opinion, what makes third-party libraries for something this fundamental feasible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there's something that could be done with Nuget to solve this issue, but I've never seen any articles describing dependency management strategies/patterns for PowerShell. Having the gallery is great, but if you've got to install all required packages manually it becomes unfeasible for any significant deployment.\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nSo it seems like what I'm looking for _may_ be available already: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/wmf/5.0/psget_moduledependency. I'll test this out as soon as I have a moment. If it works, I'll need to reconsider my position on whether this should be a core item or not. I'm still having difficulty reconciling it against the fact that JSON is a core functionality, but I suppose that it could be considered a \"lowest common denominator\".",

Ideally, we should _also_ ship the module on the Gallery, but I think a TON of modern scenarios require YAML now.\r\n> \r\n> Maybe not in 6.0 timeframe, but we should talk about it.\r\n\r\nShipping an external module is much better in my view as can be used downlevel and IMO it's less the PowerShell's Team job to do this and more the community to drive this **with** help from the PowerShell team to get to high quality where possible.\r\n ",

We agree that supporting YAML is important given how prevalent it is today.  We also want to see more modules we currently ship in PSCore6 moved out so that you start with a minimal install of PSCore6 and then add what you need (with metamodules you don't need to add 10+ modules, just one for `DevOps`, for example).  So regarding YAML, the current thinking is this should be a separate module (I can create a repo under PowerShell org if anyone is ready to start prototyping this, my team doesn't have the bandwidth right now).  Using YamlDotNet (or other 3rd party library) is ok once it's evaluated from a tech, licensing, support point of view (similar to how we took dependency on Json.Net).  However, last time we looked at YAML and YamlDotNet, the problem is that implementations of YAML vary widely and that library didn't support everything that is out there (even some popular ones).\r\n\r\nI'll just say that YAML support is something I'd like to have the team look into post 6.2 release.",

Moving them out of the project allows us to make the major changes in a new major version of the cmdlets module, and have PowerShell ship with an older version providing backwards compatibility but allowing users to update if they wish.... However, it is a huge hassle to include external modules like this, IMO.\r\n\r\nI would rather we learn from our mistakes with JSON and Pester than arbitrarily treat YAML the same way.

There is probably nothing wrong using the solution.\r\n\r\nNote that using powershell-yaml you need to ok an untrusted module. This is the part that i am battling to understand. Microsoft recommends using yaml pipelines. Microsoft (or at least this thread) suggest using 3rd party module so you can integrate yaml config with powershell, but do not endorse or recommend any. How do you explain that logically to enterprise. \r\nMy experience so far has always been that if you do not use Microsoft endorsed solutions, that would mute any support or understanding from Microsoft for your solution issues(this does not matter if the unsupported part touches anything causing problems). The mere fact that you have unsupported part usually results in no support/responsibility .\r\nMaybe things have changed in this OpenSource era. Simple official response and guidance from Microsoft would set me at ease and help me understand.\r\n\r\nAppreciated your response. Regards.",

    "body": "Thanks @marektoman , my solution was to remove the extra yaml module overhead and settle somewhere in between yaml and json.\r\n\r\nI did something similar as you when requiring an pscustomobject:\r\n$obj = Get-Content -Path .\\deployment-config.yml -raw | ConvertFrom-Yaml | convertto-json -Depth 100 | ConvertFrom-json -Depth 100\r\n\r\nThe direction I have chosen to go with:\r\nI have replaced all my yaml config with .psd1 and using Import-PowerShellDataFile\r\n\r\nNot as clean as yaml, more than sufficient and easy to read though. Also eliminated any and all module issue. \r\n\r\nExamples: \r\nSharing project with other devs that are domain policy restricted on installing random and unsigned modules, not an issue anymore.\r\nI can now . browse path before I convert it to a string\r\nadding comments are easy\r\n\r\nMy personal goals were to need little to no 3rd party modules for my ps project. I am now back on track and it's hassle free.",

It is what `'[ 1, 2 ]' | ConvertFrom-Json` _used to do_  (see #3424), and still does in Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThe price you pay for the `(...)` workaround is that all output must be collected in memory first, but I suspect that won't be a problem in practice.",

    "body": "My initial thinking is that YAML support should be standard in PowerShell 7.x. YAML is such an integral language to today's enterprises that its omission is glaring considering support for XML and JSON.  I have no problem with a separate module that can also be installed from the gallery, but it should be included by default in a new PowerShell 7.x installation. I know there are organizations that won't consider anything open source, and certainly nothing that doesn't originate or is supported by Microsoft. Given the value of PowerShell as a cloud language, native YAML support seems like the right decision.\r\n\r\nI am also less concerned about making the module downlevel compatible. If someone needs YAML conversion support for Windows PowerShell, there appear to be a number of options in the PowerShell Gallery.",

The reasoning is two-fold:\r\n\r\n* While the PowerShell package is already fairly large, we're doing our best not to add new dependencies to the package so that we don't continue to grow our size unfettered, and because we believe that pulling modules from the PowerShell Gallery (or an internal trusted Gallery, having been vetted appropriately by an enterprise) should be a standard part of a PS7 workflow. \r\n* As a team, we simply don't have the capacity to build a .NET YAML parser from scratch, nor do we have the capacity to vet, support, and service a 3rd party library for which the security implications are high-stakes.\r\n\r\nIf .NET were to officially support a YAML library, we (as Microsoft) could potentially look into supporting a YAML module on the Gallery. But until that point, the existing community modules will have to suffice.",

    "body": "Why has this been closed as WONTFIX? Seriously, YAML is so common these days, all the cloud-native stuff uses it. One can do so much with just vanilla PowerShell before they need to import a module, and not being to deal with YAML shouldn't be one of them. The built-in JSON cmdlets is one of the reasons why JSON is to popular in PowerShell: it's there, it's standardized, and it works. I am sure I am not alone defaulting to JSON just for that reason, and thinking twice about using YAML if I don't really need it, as it makes my scripts less portable or standalone.",
