I don't see how having an `-Exclude` or `-ExcludeRegex` parameter would be beneficial over a simple `| Where-Object Name -ne 'Blah'`, you can even use `-match` to match against a regex. The latter is highly customizable and already fit the existing PowerShell paradigms and providers don't support a way to natively exclude values in their underlying implementations so there are no native benefits by filtering that far left.",

    "body": "I think in this case @jborean93's concern about trying to pack too much functionality into a single cmdlet applies (I also don't understand how that would address the exclude-subtree use case - perhaps you can elaborate).\r\n\r\nWhat I - and @ssfjhh, I presume - had in mind was a simple extension of _existing_ functionality that is based on the simplicity of name literals and wildcards (and potentially _paths_).\r\n\r\nI see the following as the primary use cases of  `-Exclude` / `-Include` in combination with `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` (without the `-Recurse`, the behavior of these parameters is unfortunate - see #3304):\r\n\r\n* [Already available] Get files matching a name (pattern) across all levels of a subtree hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n* [Already available] Get directories matching a name (pattern) across all levels of a subtree hierarchy:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem -Recurse -Directory -Include node_modules\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Using `-Filter` rather than `-Include` is actually more efficient and noticeably faster, because it let's the system APIs do the filtering, but `-Include` is still necessary if you want to (a) take advantage of PowerShell's `[...]` wildcard construct and/or (b) you need to specify _multiple_ patterns.\r\n\r\n* What's missing is the ability to fundamentally, up front, include / exclude directories _and their subtrees_, before potentially applying _additional_ filtering (with `-Include`, `-Exclude`, `-Filter` and/or `-File` / `Directory`):\r\n\r\n  * `-ExcludeRecursive` would exclude any matching directories and all their contents (subtrees).\r\n\r\n  * `-IncludeRecursive` would limit further processing only to the items in matching directories and their subtrees.\r\n\r\nNote: Perhaps `-ExcludeSubtree`, `-IncludeSubtree` would be clearer, but so far we haven't used that terminology elsewhere, from what I can tell.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the following would then allow you to list all `*.js`  and `*.ts` files in a directory subtree, while excluding any `obj`, `bin`, and `node_modules` directories from the search:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include *.js, *.ts -ExcludeRecursive obj, bin, node_modules\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The Engine Working Group discussed this issue today. We believe this is a reasonable ask -- it would be nice to make it easier to exclude/include a folder completely with `Get-ChildItem`:\r\n- We prefer to reuse the `-Include` and `-Exclude` parameters instead of introducing new ones.\r\n- The proposal we had is to have `-Include` and `-Exclude` support the [Git `pathspecs`](https://css-tricks.com/git-pathspecs-and-how-to-use-them/), like in a `.gitignore` file.\r\n- Supporting `pathspecs` means we will need to support something like `a/**/b`. This obviously doesn't work with the current globbing in PowerShell, since `a/**/b` is treated as `a/*/b` in PowerShell wildcards today. Changing the semantics of `a/**/b` would be a breaking change, but it likely falls into bucket 3 (unlikely grey area).\r\n   - As for how to support a `pathspecs` syntax like `a/**/b`, since `-Include` and `-Exclude` parameters are directly handled by the underlying provider, a possible option is to have the syntax `a/**/b` directly supported by a provider, so that we can skip the globbing and just pass the literal string to the provider.\r\n   - An alternate option is to change how globing works to support the `a/**/b` syntax, but that could be tricky (hard to do) and risky (regressions).",

    "body": "From my experience with #12834:\r\n- we must fix a lot of existing issues in providers and, principally, add a lot of new tests to avoid regression.\r\n- we could consider Git pathspecs for Path parameters and generic globbing but not for Include/Exclude parameters since the parameters are provider specific.\r\n- implementing `a/**/b` is very-very expensive in Include/Exclude too and I think it makes no sense. It is globbing syntax and it should be in Globbing. \r\n- Current Include/Exclude semantic is to filter leaves in output. And there are huge weird issues how they work (with -Name and -Recurse). We should review and fix the issues. I think we will have to re-design too.\r\n- Since Include/Exclude are only for leaves switching to apply them to recursion will be huge breaking change especially for cross-platform scenarios - we will be forced to do escaping which is just a nightmare\r\n- So proposal is to introduce new parameter to control recursion.
