But if you really want to guarantee no collisions, then you could use module-qualified names\r\n```powershell\r\nmymodule\\e args...\r\n```\r\nOf course, someone could have created an alias that matched this name (however unlikely that might be) so if you want to be even more specific, for functions you could do: \r\n```powershell\r\n& $function:e  args...\r\n```\r\nand for cmdlets\r\n```powershell\r\n& (get-command -type cmdlet foo) args...\r\n```\r\nAnd finally, if you're _really_ concerned about getting exactly the right cmdlet, you could use the name of the cmdlet's implementing type to do the invocation\r\n```powershell\r\n& $executioncontext.InvokeCommand.GetCmdletByTypeName(\"My.Cmdlet.TypeName\") args...\r\n```\r\n",
