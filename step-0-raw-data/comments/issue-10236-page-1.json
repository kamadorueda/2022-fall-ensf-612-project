    "body": "First, let me say that I find it really confusing that the formatting is different depending on this WriteWarningStream NoteProperty. If we normalize that:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$o1,$o2,$o3,$o4 | % { $_ } | Add-Member NoteProperty WriteWarningStream $False -force\r\n```\r\nThey will suddenly all format the same way.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the intent of that feature is, but I've never liked it (it's very confusing when $Error occasionally shows default/white text, too).\r\n\r\nHowever ... \r\n\r\nThe reason we have separate methods on the host for different streams is to allow the host to decide whether it **needs** to add text to the front, or can rely on colors or some other formatting like prefixing with emoji or whatever. Maybe my next host will enhance the UI to display errors as pinned messages you have to dismiss and make progress output fade away gradually or ... it might put different streams in 3D parallax layers, or tabs, or columns ... or have a checkbox that lets you hide or show all messages from specific streams.\r\n\r\nNormalizing on adding text to the front (as though the world is black and white) might be a step in the wrong direction. I mean, I would love to have _templates_ for these strings, so I could put a timestamp and user or host name in them, maybe even a duration (i.e. the time since script start), or the path of the script that wrote the message...\r\n\r\nBut I'm not sure hard-coding extra text -- in particular text that the current hosts are also already adding -- is the right solution. Clearly someone's making a deliberate choice to output these differently based on a property of the object...\r\n\r\n- Would applying prefixes to the _existing_ Write*Line methods mean that existing hosts hosting a new PowerShell would end up with double \"WARNING: WARNING: \" text on the front of their messages (as long as they have the `WriteWarningStream` property)?\r\n\r\n- Would _all_ output need to go through an extra if/else switch to decide which interface the host supports in order to be able to fall back to the available Write*Line method if the newer one wasn't available?\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I'm going to think about this more while I take care of some real-life needs, but one thought comes to mind up front:\r\n\r\nI think having PowerShell deal with how to display stream messages in a clear and unambiguous manner by default (i.e. in a black and white world, how should stream messages appear to a user), and having hosts deal with all of the extras that a runtime doesn't deal with (i.e. color, pinning, showing output in separate windows, etc.) would be a good model to follow. Whether that text is prefixed or not, I don't care that much, as long as it is clear from the _default_ output where a stream message came from, irrespective of the host that is displaying that stream message. Hosts should then be able to show that default output, or show some other output, depending on their needs. If hosts had more methods that accepted `*Record` objects, they could decide what to do with them, and they wouldn't be subject to default views unless they wanted to, no?",

This is the only way that I can think of that allows hosts to present message information in the best possible way (i.e. they need all of the details available on the record) while also allowing PowerShell to also present the information in the best way possible when working with text-only, without colors.",
