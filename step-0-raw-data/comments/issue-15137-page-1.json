You can look at using [PSWSMan](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWSMan/) which is a fork of the WSMan library and included TLS verification that is missing from the built in version. Note that you still need to specify `-SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACeck -SkipCNCheck)` in PowerShell but rest assured cert validation still happens. When PowerShell 7.2 is out those session options arenâ€™t mandatory anymore when you use this fork (they will actually disable the checks like on Windows) but older versions still require them to be set.",
