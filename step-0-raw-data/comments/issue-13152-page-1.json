I understand that the mutation is the point, that's what makes it faster.  That said, mutation isn't free in terms of design.  If you don't *know* you're mutating the LHS that could end up being just as problematic in the long term.  Calling `List<>.Add` explicitly makes it very clear what's happening.",

    "body": "@SeeminglyScience sure, totally get your point, I'm just trying to envision a scenario where if your logical flow is that you want a new array but preserve the old array and this is the syntax you would be using vs. just creating a new array.\r\nE.g. why would you do \r\n```powershell\r\n$a = 1..10\r\n$b = $a\r\n$b += 11\r\n```\r\ninstead of \r\n```powershell\r\n$a = 1..10\r\n$b = $a + 11\r\n```\r\nand \r\n```powershell\r\n$a = 1..10\r\n$a += 11\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom just a logical standpoint, the fact that $a is still associated to $b because you did $a = $b is a side effect that you explicity called out, so I think you would know that it's doing it. Regardless, still not a problem that I think documentation wouldn't solve, it wouldn't be a completely new phenomenom in Powershell (e.g. lots of commands/etc. act differently depending on if you are passing a string vs. an object vs. a hashtable, etc.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I can see a case for $b = $a + 11 still returning a brand new `object[]` to be important, as one reasonably may not expect that $a would change as a result of this operation, maybe the scope should be narrowed to specifically the `+=` and `-=` operators only.",
