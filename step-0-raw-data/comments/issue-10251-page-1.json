For example, many modules include a `psm1` file whose sole purpose is to dot-source a bunch of `ps1` files.\r\n\r\nTo make that easier, module authors often just dot-source all `ps1` files in a folder (e.g. public or private). That could be dangerous though, because someone could drop a `ps1` file in a module folder resulting in additional code that is executed when a module is loaded. I've worked around that by only dot-sourcing files that have a signature that matches the signature on the `psm1` file, and reusing that code in a shared snippet in SnippetPx, but that's just creating more work to put things in place to make it easier to define modules.\r\n\r\nIt would be much better to identify the cases where a `psm1` file really shouldn't be necessary, and enhance `psd1` files so that they support those cases, making module authoring easier. That won't happen though, as long as we're stuck in legacy support mode.",

I get the feeling it's not just me that's wasted time chasing a ghost that's been implemented as a parameter, documented and then not implemented.\r\n\r\nApologies for not raising a new issue but as I say there seem to be enough of them on the subject and they all pretty much lead to this one.",
