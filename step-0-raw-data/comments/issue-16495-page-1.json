I haven't made an issue for this yet but `$something.Value = [void]$anyExpressionHere` straight up fails to compile. Casting to void in general probably needs a closer look.\r\n\r\n> Is there an actual use case of assigning a `[void]` casted `-match` result to a variable?\r\n\r\nNot really, but the compiler omitting code on accident is still problematic. This was found by @JustinGrote on accident while testing some changes in the PowerShell extension for VSCode.",
