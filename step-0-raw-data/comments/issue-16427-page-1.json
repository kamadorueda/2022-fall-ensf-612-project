I suspect now that:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n(Get-ChildItem $TempFolder) |ForEach-Object { ... }\r\n```\r\nis smart and actually still emitting each item one by one despite the parenthesis.\r\nAnd only when it is forced to an array it will choke the pipeline:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n@(Get-ChildItem $TempFolder) |ForEach-Object { ... }\r\n```\r\nOr???",
