On Powershell 6.0, the default protocol is WSMan as DCOM is not supported. \n\nOn Powershell 5.1, if we do Test-Connection . -Protocol WSMan, we get the same error as Powershell 6.0. If we execute 'winrm quickconfig' as suggested by the error message then Test-Connection . works as expected on both versions. \n\nWith this, I am marking this as \"By Design\", please remove the label if you do not agree, otherwise close the issue. \n",
