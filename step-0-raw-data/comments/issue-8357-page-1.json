Clashing with properties called `_` doesn't bother me, but special casing `-Property _` to mean \"the object\" feels weird, is there anywhere else that meaning exists? Would people then expect it to work with other cmdlets that have a -Property?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the idea of it being valid to use where-object with no parameters at all?\r\n\r\nIt's growing on me to treat the word \"object\" in \"where-object\" as implying `$_`; if we agree that the parameter form `-Property 'Foo' -oper -Value $bar` equals a scriptblock form `{ $_.Foo -oper $bar }`, then it makes sense to allow leaving any of those parts out in the parameter form and have the behaviour the same as if you left them out in the scriptblock form. The following patterns fall out of it, the first two are valid now, the last two are not, but seem fitting:\r\n\r\n    # param + operator\r\n    | where-object { $_.Foo -gt $bar }                  # scriptblock pattern becomes:\r\n    | where-object -Property Foo -gt -Value $bar        # parameter form.\r\n    | where-object Foo -gt $bar                         # binding without parameter names.\r\n    Import-Csv test.csv | where-object Quantity -gt 5   # example use.\r\n\r\n\r\n    # param only\r\n    | where-object { $_.Foo }                     # casting the property value to bool\r\n    | where-object -Property Foo                  # doing that by leving out -Value param\r\n    | where-object  Foo                           # and by positional binding\r\n    Import-Csv test.csv | where-object InStock\r\n\r\n\r\n    # Operator only\r\n    | where-object { $_ -gt $bar }     # no property specified, ->\r\n    | where-object -gt $bar            # $_ is implied by the \"object\" part of \"Where-Object\"\r\n    Get-Content test.txt | where-object -match 'baz'\r\n\r\n    # Neither\r\n    | where-object { $_ }        # implicitly casting the object to bool\r\n    | where-object               #  $_ is implied by the \"object\" part of \"where-object\"\r\n    Get-Content test.txt| Where-Object\r\n\r\nIf we did use `_` that also works, but it is a bit of a weird special case, and things seem to work neatly without that.",

Well, truthiness does, at least:\r\n```\r\nPS> 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3 | Where-Object\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe _problem_ arises with how parameters are defined. If you attempt to do the above with `Where-Object -gt 1` you hit an issue &mdash; the value `1` is assigned by position, and ends up being assigned to the `-Property` parameter, _not_ `-Value`.\r\n\r\nI'm considering whether simply dropping `-Value` as a parameter might be a better option, and having the \"value\" be taken by the selected operator parameter, rather than have them be switch parameters. This would be a breaking change as it would technically remove an operator, but I think is preferable to having a confusing and potentially unpredictable doubling up on the parameters. (And, at least in the scripts I see, people actually specifying `-Value` by name are _extremely_ rare.)\r\n\r\nThe alternative would be doing the above _without_ dropping `-Value` as a parameter, which means we have to do a runtime check to ensure users don't accidentally provide a value to _both_ parameters.\r\n\r\nEither method is fine, but I'd be interested to hear what y'all think of that. 😄 ",

Without doing it like this, the `$Array | Where-Object -gt 3` assigns `3` to the `-Property` parameter by position instead.\r\n\r\n@BrucePay I'd appreciate your thoughts on this approach and/or any better alternatives if you are thinking of something I've missed. 😄 ",

    "body": "> To my opinion, by default (where no parameters are supplied except for the `$InputObject`), the `Where-Object` should filter-out just `$Null`\r\n\r\nI think this will get a range of opinions. Just null ? Null and empty string / empty array.  \r\n\r\nCurrently Powershell allows this:\r\n `([PSCustomObject]@{Foo=$true}  ) | where -Property foo `\r\nand it returns the object if Foo is \"truthy\" (so if it is 0 it won't be returned.).  It is the equivalent of `where {$_.foo}` which makes sense. \r\n\r\nEffectively what is being proposed here says with no `-property` specified `where-object` should apply to the object.  Which I think works fine with `-ne \"\"` , `-gt 0`  , ` -ne $null` or `-is [object]`\r\n\r\nThe logical combination of those two would be `Where-object ` with _no parameters_ should pass through objects which are truthy - the same as running `Where-object {$_}`  dropping 0, empty string and empty array as well as null.   TBH dropping the zeros from a stream of numbers would help in some places and cause subtle, maddening bugs in others . Making the object and property behaviours different would not be good .\r\n\r\nI'd be inclined to allow <operator> <value> without -property for \"where the object\". And  keep the current -Property without <operator> <value> but require SOME parameter. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@jszabo98: the description of your intended results does not match with what the example commands are actually doing (suggesting that you perhaps don't \"*get*\" the way powershell works). You state that you are trying to search object property names and values but\r\n~~~\r\nget-process cmd | findstr /i cmd\r\n~~~\r\nsimply finds all the lines produced by `Get-Process` **AFTER** its output objects are converted to text by `Format-Table` (or maybe `Format-List` for other cmdlets with more default displayed properties). In this case that's every line except the column headers, since you restricted `Get-Process` to only produce output objects for processes named \"cmd\". So no \"selection\" of property names or values.  \r\n\r\nIn\r\n~~~\r\nget-process cmd | where { $_ -match 'cmd' }\r\n~~~\r\nyou are selecting `Get-Process` output objects which `-match` 'cmd' but `-match` only operates on `[String]` or `[String[]]` (i.e. single strings or arrays of string). Thus, every `Get-Process` output object is first converted to a `[String]` before the match is attempted. Since the `ToString()` method of `[System.Diagnostics.Process]` simply appends the process name to the type name (supplied by `[Object].ToString()`), `$_` gets converted to \"System.Diagnostics.Process (cmd)\" which then matches so the entire object is passed through `Where-Object`.  \r\n\r\nIf you had not restricted the output of `Get-Process`, the result would have been similar except that the output would have included any process that had a name which matched 'cmd' (i.e. if the name had 'cmd' *anywhere* in it).  \r\n\r\nIn 'search-object.ps1', (ignoring several possible optimizations) you set `$hash` to an empty hash table in the `-Begin` script block (executed only once *before* processing any input objects) and then add each found item in the `-Process` script block. This means that the hash table will try to accumulate the matched properties of the current object and **every** preceding object. The most likely result is that you will have two objects match on the values of properties with same name or just have the names match `$pattern`. Attempting to add an item with the same name as an existing item will throw an exception. You could change `$hash += @{$name = $value}` to `$hash[$name] = $value` thus overwriting the value for each new object processed (automatically creating an item if it doesn't exist), however you will still accumulate items from previously processed objects. Unless this is what you intended, you need to place the `$hash = @{}` at the beginning of the `-Process` script block to have an empty hash table for each object to be matched (this would also solve the duplicate name problem).\r\n",

    "body": "Regarding the problem of accessing the object as a whole instead of a particular property, how about changing the allowed arguments to `-Property` to include methods? This would allow access to strings and value type objects as follows:\r\n~~~\r\nWhere-Object 'tostring()' -eq 'cmd' # trying to match a string object\r\n\r\nWhere-Object 'tostring(\"x\")' -match '00$' # trying to match a numeric value which is a multiple of 256\r\n# not the most efficient way, just a demonstration of the potential versatility available\r\n\r\nWhere-Object 'toint32($null)' -gt 1024 # checking the value of a numeric or parsed string\r\n# had to use $null since no overload of ToInt32 with 0 arguments\r\n\r\n# \"properties\" are verbatim quoted to prevent parser errors\r\n~~~\r\nThe main argument in favour of this is that it provides the desired functionality for strings (vast majority of cases) but does not introduce any special cases or break existing syntax. While not as compact as perhaps desired, there might be efficiency benefits to directly calling a method and processing the result within the cmdlet instead of calling a script block to do the work.",
