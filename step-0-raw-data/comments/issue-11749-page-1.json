It would be the only case (I think) of an assignment operator not _actually_ assigning something.\r\n\r\nI agree that that would be problematic; @PetSerAl  originally voiced the concern and proposed implementing a specialized list type that doesn't violate the equivalence of `$a += $b` and `$a = $a + $b` while still performing well (though reference equality would not be maintained) - see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5805#issuecomment-367866807.\r\n\r\nThe C# `+=` syntax for adding event delegates is indeed an interesting anomaly.\r\n\r\n> Even with PowerShell's custom array addition, you're still assigning the new array.\r\n\r\nYes, but for users not concerned with reference equality that usually isn't a _functional_ problem - but with high iteration counts becomes a _performance_ concern.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, what's tricky about `+=` currently is that it quietly converts a non-array collection type to an `[object[]]` array, which adds quiet loss of type fidelity to the performance concern:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$var = [System.Collections.Generic.List[object]] 42\r\n$var += 43 # creates a *copy* of the list *as an array*, with the new element appended.\r\n$var.GetType().Name   # -> 'Object[]' !!\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuggesting that `+=` be mapped to `.Add()` is seductive (it was the _starting point_ of #5805), but ultimately too problematic. \r\n\r\nIn light of that, the best that could be done with `+=` for non-array LHS values is to create copies _as the LHS type_ rather than as an array (which wouldn't address the _performance_ concerns and may not always be possible).\r\n\r\nFor a potential future built-in `[list]` type, @PetSerAl's proposal strikes me as the best way forward.\r\n\r\nI suggest continuing the conversation at #5805.\r\n\r\n",
