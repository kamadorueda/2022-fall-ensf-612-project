    "body": "@Jaykul we've had a lot of problems with not exactly correct `TERM` settings, as `System.Console` is a very new library on Linux, and so doesn't fallback well. \n\nSo to get down to the bottom of this, can you give me this information:\n\nFirst I want to know for sure the key code being sent.\n\n``` sh\nsudo showkey\n< uparrow>\n< enter >\n< ctrl-c >\n```\n\nOn my machine this shows me:\n\n``` sh\nsudo showkey\nkb mode was UNICODE\n[ if you are trying this under X, it might not work\nsince the X server is also reading /dev/console ]\n\npress any key (program terminates 10s after last keypress)...\n^[[A\n^Ccaught signal 2, cleaning up...\n```\n\nSo my up arrow is sending the key code `^[` (escape) `[A` (and I imagine this is true for you; if it's not then things are very strange).\n\nNext I want to see what your terminfo entry is for your current term, so translate `^[` into `\\E` (escape in another form) and do this:\n\n``` sh\ninfocmp -L1 | grep -F '\\E[A'\n```\n\nIf all is well, it should report `key_up=\\E[A` which `System.Console` should be interpreting correctly (as this is essentially all .NET does). If it's not `key_up` then we've found that your `TERM` isn't quite right; if it is `key_up` then it would seem something is wrong with `System.Console`.\n\nI'm also curious what this gives in PowerShell:\n\n``` powershell\n[Console]::ReadKey()\n< up arrow >\n```\n\nIf everything is working right it'll be:\n\n```\nKeyChar     Key Modifiers\n-------     --- ---------\n       UpArrow         0\n```\n\nP.S. I agree with @lzybkr, it shouldn't crash. When < up arrow > is interpreted right, and PSReadLine is disabled, we simply discard it. PowerShell is definitely not receiving a `ConsoleKeyInfo` up arrow. I just don't yet know where it's gone wrong.\n",
