    "body": "I mentioned to @TheJasonHelmick at Ignite re: the Secrets module inputs needing a MaskInput sort of idea. Been thinking about that recently and I think we could potentially create a more detached solution than _just_ putting it on Read-Host or New-Secret.\r\n\r\nWhat do y'all think of generalizing this interface into a parameter attribute (e.g., `[MaskInput()]`) that PS can read and apply when prompting for input, and possibly even _on the actual command line_?\r\n\r\nFor example, let's say `New-Secret` has a `-Value` parameter with `[MaskInput()]` attribute applied:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> New-Secret -Name MySecret -Value ************\r\n```\r\nThat is, PS automatically censors any value for that parameter. It would handle:\r\n1. bare strings (and stop on space, since that's where the parameter ends)\r\n2. contents of strings, so `-Value \"********\"` etc would still hide the string contents, only stopping when the closing quote is applied (bonus: include here-strings?)\r\n3. _not_ variable names, I would think; that seems counter-productive\r\n\r\nIt would also have to remove the data from any logging and history data, including that captured by PSReadLine, or somehow prevent those tools capturing it at all in the first place.\r\n\r\nThis would let us simply tag parameters we want to be \"secret\" or masked, at least, and we can then implement this in a wider scope than just read-host, especially as `[securestring]` is fundamentally not secure in .NET Core. \r\n\r\nRead-Host itself is probably fine with a switch, but other cmdlets may want to take values on the command line directly with the ability to mask them. (In scripts this probably wouldn't work, but you're probably doing it wrong anyway if you're trying to hide secrets in a plaintext script!)",

If users must type it, to prevent it being appearing on screen, either the author must specify a parameter type of [securestring()] or call read-host with an -asSecureString. \r\nIn either case it's necessary to jump through a hoop to get back to the insecure string. \r\n\r\nPersonally I think it gives an even greater false sense of security to have parameter input ,  psreadline etc detecting a parameter attribute and masking things out on the command line. Especially as now the function can be written in a script as a \r\n`new-secret -name mySecret -value \"Pr0mi5e!2tell\" `\r\n\r\nTBH I'd avoid readhost and just have a securestring parameter ... \r\n",

And you also can't create a securestring from the command prompt or in a script, or in any way really that doesn't either include some kind of prompt, or leave the \"secret\" value in a log somewhere, which is far from ideal, unless you use Get-Credential to do it -- which is also just another prompt, too; there's no way to create a securestring that doesn't leave a log without a prompt, currently, which feels like an oversight / missing feature. 🙂 \r\n\r\nOtherwise... yes, agreed. Perhaps `[securestring]` parameters could be the basis of masking input, but there's still work needed in PS itself to make that work... and I'm uneasy about using [securestring] as-is, since it's simply not secure. 😕 \r\n\r\nPerhaps we'd need to have a powershell-native type that does a bit of extra work to ensure it's as secure as possible, or something. 🤔 ",
