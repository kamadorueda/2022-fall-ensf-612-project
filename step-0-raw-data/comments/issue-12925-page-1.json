    "body": "> create an executable file with appropriate name (like \"T ( E ( S ) T)\") and run it.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov I don't think it is possible to assign an alias with special characters from within PowerShell (so as to be executed from a testcase). ~If I were to do it from bash, that alias wouldn't carry over to PowerShell when I run the latter~. And even if I'm going to create a custom executable, that extra file will always be hardcoded for that one test case, isn't it?\r\n\r\nI thought it would be better to create a temporary file for one manual test.\r\nI called it \"t(e(s)t)\" and the contents of it are as follows\r\n`#!/bin/bash`\r\n`pwsh`\r\n\r\nAfter executing this from bash, it launched PowerShell as expected and on running `Get-Process`, you can note that it was indeed listed in the process list as shown below in the screenshot.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32306614/84246488-53b89700-ab24-11ea-8d32-6b1d73be209f.png)\r\n\r\nAnd indeed the issue seems to have been solved from the one manual test, as shown below.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32306614/84246586-75198300-ab24-11ea-9263-eafad9bf16f9.png)\r\n\r\nI don't think including this one file to run testcases on it time and again makes any sense. So it will be unnecessary to include the hardcoded testcase, however, I have added a testcase that checks if the parent property returned is not not null when looked up using process name (and not process ID).

(Process name is \"ConsoleHost mai\".) After the bug will be fixed your test will pass. You should create a process name so that your new code is executed in the new test.\n\nAnd about the linux fails, I think they're because of an unbuilt version of pwsh. (The pwsh in the current branch is still running the version that is not bug free, right?)",
