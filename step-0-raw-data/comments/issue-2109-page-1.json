I was thinking it'd be good to add this to PowerShell directly so these cmdlets are available out of the box. \n\nI was thinking of pulling YAMLDotNet into the PowerShell code, and create a cmdlet for it. I wanted guidance on adding other oss into the core product. If v6.0 ships with Windows, are there legal restrictions? Is there a mechanism to add these types of cmdlets so it ships with the OSS version and not the Windows release? etc\n",

Presumably, if it goes into PowerShell itself, it's locked to that and higher versions of PowerShell (and difficult to update outside of that cadence, as you mentioned @kilasuit).\n\nOn top of that, presumably an external module could target down-level PowerShell versions.  IMHO this alone, assuming you target PS3 or PS4, would justify a separate module - many of us on the operations side don't have a choice, or aren't ready to move to PS5+ across the board - not everyone runs a farm of cattle unfortunately : )\n\nCheers!\n",
