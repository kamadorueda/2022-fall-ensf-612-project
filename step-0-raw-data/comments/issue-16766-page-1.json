    "body": "I believe the problem here is running `Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1` inside an actual PSSession. IIRC this particular step will bounce the WinRM service killing any existing connections thus leading to your error. It's the same with registering a JEA configuration as both call [Register-PSSessionConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-pssessionconfiguration?view=powershell-7.2). If you need to run this remotely you would either need to try and ignore the error or run it independently of WinRM. What I mean by that is to run it using a different transport (like SSH, PSExec, etc) or run it inside some kind of background task after you've exited the session (`Invoke-CimMethod Win32_Process Create`).",
