What about it has made you \"spit and curse\" when using it? What makes you feel MS is pushing backwards vs forging ahead?\r\n\r\n> In an effort to unify the shell world, I think PowerShell could get really creative by providing a ZSH and BASH compatibility layer.\r\n\r\nWhat does such a compatibility layer look like to you? Are there specific things you want added? If so, can you share some examples? Or did the replies above telling you that you could just invoke bash with an inline script really address your concerns? Since you didn't respond, I have no idea if that is all you were looking for or not.\r\n\r\nFYI, related to this topic, there are some discussions going on about adding language syntax that has bash users in mind. For example, [this RFC that is currently in a PR](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/192). It proposes adding chaining via `&&` and `||`. If it's more features like those that you're looking for, what else?",

    "body": "Old post, but as far as I can tell, Powershell is NOT currently POSIX compatible, as @iSazonov suggested. I've been toying around with it since I've been trying out [fvim](https://github.com/yatli/fvim) on windows. There are basic POSIX things that aren't supported and just not there. \r\n\r\nTo demystify what \"POSIX compatibility\" means for users like @KirkMunro, it basically just amounts to support for a subset of syntax and functionality called the POSIX Shell, which is laid out in [this document](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799.2018edition/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18). It includes things like, but not limited to:\r\n\r\n- `$@`, which is equivalent to `$args`\r\n- `$1`, `$2`, etc to get the first and second arguments, and so on\r\n- `if` / `fi`, `case` /  `esac` syntax\r\n\r\nThis syntax looks super fugly, especially for those who are used to the way PS does things. However, it's an important stepping stone, because it would attract people from the linux world who may have kept from switching to PS as their main scripting shell because their scripts wouldn't be guaranteed to run in PS.
