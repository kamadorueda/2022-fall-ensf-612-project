    "body": "Ð¡oming from its nature PowerShell cannot handle values like C# - all values are boxed by design and passed by reference. This leads to performance (memory allocations) issues. Implementing argument passing by value in scripts will only worsen this problem (We have some issues for this.). Conversely, PowerShell uses caching to reduce memory allocations.\r\n\r\nReally that we can do here - address a specific business scenario if we get it or a hot code path. But again, it will most likely be a movement in the opposite direction from what you request. (We already had such perf PRs.)\r\n\r\n/cc @daxian-dbw @SeeminglyScience @mklement0 if they want to add more.",

Variables in PowerShell are implemented as `PSVariable` objects (for the most part) where the value is stored on a property `public object Value { get; }`.  Since the parameter is also typed as `object`, the boxed value is passed to the function.  If you change the parameter type to `int` it doesn't repro anymore.",
