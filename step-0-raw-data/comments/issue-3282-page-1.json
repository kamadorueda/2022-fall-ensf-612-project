However, this capability does not need to reside with the cmdlet. There is nothing preventing an administrator from running `Get-LocalGroup` using `Invoke-Command`. In fact, this would be preferable given the remoting features with `Invoke-Command` such as alternate credentials, throttle limits, disconnected sessions, and ssh support. We are marking this issue as `Won't Fix`.",
