PowerShell needs to create a few cache folders (e.g. .cache, .local) under `$Home`, and when the environment variable `Home` is not defined or has an empty value, PowerShell will create a temporary folder and consider that as the user home directory. This is why you see those folders with GUID names.\r\n\r\nThis should be fixed. We partially fixed the issue before (see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13239), where we make sure only 1 temporary folder is used within a pwsh session, but that didn't solve the problem when many pwsh sessions start and end quickly. We should fix that too.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n>```\r\n>Each time a powershell script is run with the service user, selinux gives loads of denied events like the following;\r\n>#tail -f /var/log/audit/audit.log | grep denied\r\n>.......\r\n>type=AVC msg=audit(1631798453.792:11014): avc:  denied  { getattr } for  pid=5141 comm=506970656C696E6520457865637574 path=\"/usr/sbin/lvm\" dev=\"dm-0\" ino=492056 scontext=system_u:system_r:zabbix_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:lvm_exec_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0\r\n>type=AVC msg=audit(1631798453.792:11016): avc:  denied  { getattr } for  pid=5141 comm=506970656C696E6520457865637574 path=\"/usr/bin/rpm\" dev=\"dm-0\" ino=50624503 scontext=system_u:system_r:zabbix_t:s0 tcontext=system_u:object_r:rpm_exec_t:s0 tclass=file permissive=0\r\n>```\r\n\r\nThis is likely due to the policy of SELinux.\r\nAccording to [this article](https://www.linuxtopia.org/online_books/getting_started_with_SELinux/SELinux_log_file_messages.html), the `\"{ getattr }\"` means that someone tried to `stat()` the file. In this case, the file's attributes were looked up first (or at least, the operation tried to look them up), couldn't get those attributes and gave up. And the `\"path=/usr/sbin/lvm\"` is the path to the object you tried to perform an operation on -- it could be a command resolution (searching executables in PATH) triggered by a command invocation.",

    "body": "@daxian-dbw thanks for the resolution.\r\n\r\nI feel like telemetry shouldn't be enabled by default. For example related to this issue, our customer added values but didn't work out in PowerShell 7.2.2. It generates thousands of telemetry files and it fills up the disk and generates IO on the server.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/928600/166663269-78cc7f3a-8dfc-42ee-8bf0-53cc5dc0ba4a.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/928600/166663284-985d4aa0-d398-45d6-959e-c5f48a7d4baf.png)\r\n\r\nI kindly ask opinions of @JamesWTruher and @adityapatwardhan about the telemetry behaviour. I don't think majority of the people will ever use these files and it already caused some issues for now, so that makes me think \"if someone needs telemetry in the future, they should enable the telemetry\".\r\n",
