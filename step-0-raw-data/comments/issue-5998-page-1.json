    "body": "`Enable-PSRemoting` uses `Set-WSManQuickConfig` which fails if any of the network connections are set to `Public`.  The way to fix this in Windows PowerShell is something like: `Get-NetConnectionProfile | Set-NetConnectionProfile -NetworkCategory Private` (although you should really do this per net connection profile, this is only for testing purposes on a private network you trust...).\r\n\r\nThe \"good news\" is that if you add the Windows PowerShell PSModulePath, the *-NetConnectionProfile cmdlets work with PSCore6 (at least for this purpose, haven't tested it beyond that).\r\n\r\n`Enable-SSHRemoting` would not depend on `Set-WSManQuickConfig` so it wouldn't encounter this issue.  However, it seems that we should still respect public vs private network connection profiles so that `-AllowRemotingOverPublicNetworks` type of switch would allow manual override.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's much we can do about `Set-WSManQuickConfig` as the actual implementation of that cmdlet functionality is within WinRM.",

But in my testing, only Win10 threw that error, while both WS16 and WS19 ran Enable-PSRemoting successfully even though they were using Public network connection profile.\r\n\r\nIf the error is intended to be a security warning, shouldn't it be thrown on all Windows SKUs when using Public network connection profile? And shouldn't it be more clearly worded to be a security warning, and mention that -SkipNetworkProfileCheck will skip the check? The existing wording \"WinRM firewall exception will not work...\" seems misleading/confusing, since it will work if you add -SkipNetworkProfileCheck. \r\n",
