The same applies to the other two issues you submitted. \r\n\r\nAlso, this is not a bug, but the result of treating filename as a glob. Minimal test case would be a file named `[.txt`. ``` ls '`[.txt' ``` will work, but ``` ls '`[.txt' | ls``` with through an error about mismatched `[`.\r\n\r\nThis is solved by using `-LiteralPath` whenever you pipe in filenames. I believe the same will apply to the other two issues. Its similar to how `$x -Match $x` will fail if `$x` contains any of `\\?*[]^$`",

There are pain points around the use of `[`  and  `]` filenames because they can be treated as wild cards. \r\nThe advice is \r\n1. Avoid using these characters. \r\n2. If you **must** use them specify -LiteralPath  - there are places where the  `[` and `]` can be escaped with a `` ` `` but this is not reliable.  See #17992  and #18038  among other places.\r\n\r\nIn all three failing examples above  the inner command  ```  ls  'abc `[defg`].pdf' ``` works because the string is treated as -Path and escaping works  as desired.    \r\nThe full name - which is what the file object gives when converting to a string - does _not_ escape the name so the outer command runs `ls 'abc [defg].pdf' ` un-escaped, which fails.    \r\nIf the outer command may need to deal with names that contain wildcard chars it _must_ use `-literalpath`\r\n\r\n\r\n",
