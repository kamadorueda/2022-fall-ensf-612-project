Don't recall exactly) pwsh was able to search the location the library was in for native DLLs (though not subfolders). As part of one of the changes in 6.2, that was removed, and this seems like a sensible place to add it.\r\n\r\nCan we have it also check the same folder as the managed library so that anything that was using the old behaviour works again as well?",

Perhaps we could for the moment solve that problem with use of wildcards?\r\n\r\nIt is just a case I name as \"edge\". Very unlikely to be needed. I believe any developer prefer to create portable solutions.\r\nAlso Core does not have a reliable way to determine OS/kernel version.\r\nSo I suggest only use portable RIDs. At least until we get feedback.\r\n",
