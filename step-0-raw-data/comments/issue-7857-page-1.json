I have other projects I've started - a PowerShell profiler and a PowerShell script formatter, so clearly I have a problem starting projects but not finding time to move them along.\r\n\r\nOne thought I had on external motivation was to start a charity fundraiser - I'd commit to a project if the charity gets funded. I haven't worked out the charity or the funding target though.",
