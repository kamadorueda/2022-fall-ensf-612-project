    "body": "@vexx32:\r\n\r\nThe problem isn't that the by-property-name parameter _isn't_ bound - it is - it's that the by-value parameter is _also_ bound, which, with `[string]` / `[object]` / `[psobject]` by-value parameters happens _invariably_ - unless you bind these parameters by _argument_ rather than via the pipeline (as @jszabo98 implies).\r\n\r\nJust to spell it out for the example command:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Binding -Name *by argument* makes the problem go away. \r\n[pscustomobject]@{type='cmdlet'}  | get-command -Name * \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parameter binder is designed to bind input to _all_ suitable pipeline-binding parameters, even though the typical use case is for pipeline input to bind to just _one_ parameter.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe behavior is certainly frustrating, and the workaround isn't obvious, but a generic solution would require changes to the parameter binder, which, apart from backward-compatibility concerns, raises tricky conceptual issues:\r\n\r\n* For `[object]` / `[psobject]`-typed parameters, there is no solution -  by their nature (everything is derived from them), they should continue to bind everything.\r\n\r\n   * Cmdlet authors should simply not bind such parameters by value if they also want to support other pipeline parameters that should bind in isolation.\r\n\r\n* For `[string]`-typed parameters and other specific types, conceivably a `StrictType` attribute argument could be introduced that binds only if the input object already is of the target type (or a derived type) rather than just being _convertible_ to it; e.g.:  \r\n`[Parameter(ValueFromPipeline, StrictType)] [string] $Name]`, which would then only bind `[string]` input objects, and not also instances of other types, such as `[pscustomobject]@{type='cmdlet'}`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor now, the only options I see are:\r\n\r\n* For cmdlets that do use `[string]` / `[object]` / `[psobject]` by-value parameters alongside other, conceptually independent pipeline-binding parameters, _document_ the pitfall and workaround.\r\n   * Among the cmdlets affected are `Get-Command`, as demonstrated here, and, on Windows PowerShell, `Get-Service` which also has a `-ComputerName` parameter there that clashes with `-Name` - see this [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50341501/45375).\r\n   * Others?\r\n\r\n* When authoring new cmdlets, avoid use of such parameters, if possible.\r\n\r\n* Document guidelines for cmdlet authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
