This allows me to reinstall my system and keep all my apps in the same state without needing to reinstall them.\r\n\r\nAnother useful scenario: I'm a sysadmin, and I carry an USB flash drive which contains utilities that I use for fixing and managing machines, including `pwsh`. This allows me to just connect the drive wherever needed and instantly, I have all my tools ready without installation and configuration.\r\n\r\nGiven how minor the requested change is, I personally feel it enables scenarios useful enough to be worth it.\r\n\r\nBtw, do you have any numbers for the startup slowdown caused by reading the config file? On my machine, bare pwsh without profile runs in about 350 ms - I find it hard to believe that this time is noticeably influenced by reading and parsing a single JSON file.",
