For better discoverability I'd suggest to consider Out-HostPager name\r\n3. PowerShell could do smart things for paginating but we should investigate such scenarios with caution.\r\n    - Add a flag in Formatting system could annoying users if it is default but this could be opt-in.\r\n    - Traditionally we moderate this by a preference variable/switch/attribute which is possibly superfluous for these scenarios\r\n\r\nSo my preference - only implement Out-Pager/Out-HostPager in 7.1 and then wait more feedback.\r\n",

Personally I have the opposite experience, the amount of times I'd have preferred the behavior you described is very rare.\r\n\r\n> I'm trying to think of a case where I'd stop after a screenful not review each item - at least for the first few items.\r\n\r\nOften when exploring something interactively that returns a lot of results, you can tell whether you need to change your search criteria based on the first page.  Also if you're fishing for a specific item with broad search criteria, you would want to stop processing the search once you spot what you're looking for.\r\n\r\n",

(2) most of the time we don't need to process objects returned - we don't achieve _benefit_  from changing, and (3) At 18 characters instead of 4 it doesn't offer _convenience_.  \r\nAnother parallel is `| clip`, which I use most days. Windows PowerShell (in  V4  or V5) introduced a functionally identical `Set-Clipboard`  which is more typing for something doesn't work  everywhere-  `| clip.exe`  works in bash on Windows, cmd, and legacy PowerShell (which I still have to work with)  \r\n\r\n**I'm not saying** no one will ever prefer it, but before embarking on doing something because it's possible, there needs to be clarity on where it offers a gain (and where it doesn't try to), to justify using effort which could deliver something else. It can't be universal, something already does the job, so in what way is this doing the job better?    \r\n\r\n> * It may make sense to have paging as a common feature, but did not agree on whether it's a common parameter or some other configuration/preference set by the user\r\n\r\nThink very, _very_, **very** hard about introducing `Do-not-return-objects-but-print-text` options. Some commands _do_ exist to put stuff onthe console for a human to read (`format-table`,  `Get-Help`) and their _objects_ are seldom exploited.      \r\nBut the thinking which says \"`-Paged` would be a good common parameter\" would also say \"`-AsTable` , `-AsList`  and  `-AsStrings` would be good parameters\" and is countered by the same logic which says no,  use `format-Table` , `format-list` , or ` out-string` \r\n\r\nAnd again ask the question if / how / when `-paged`  gives a better solution than `|more`.  \r\n",

    "body": "> @jhoneill personally I'd just prefer to have a native paging cmdlet so I don't have to bother checking what pager(s) might be available on a given system.\r\n\r\nI think we might talking at cross-purposes. `|more` works in pwsh, windows PowerShell, even legacy versions, cmd, bash, whatever.  Introducing `out-Pager` means I first have to stop and think \"What pager is available in this shell\" and type the longer `| Out-Pager`. So why wouldn't I do `|more` ? \r\n\r\n> A short alias to it is simple enough if it's a separate cmdlet. \r\nAt least that removes the need for more typing to get the same effect. I agree on `Out-Host -Paging` \r\n",

    "body": "> Hmm. A pager implementation could be made to format non-output streams according to their typical standard formatting, though, since non-output streams have their own discrete types.\r\n\r\nThis could be handled similar to how `Out-Null` is currently implemented.  During `PipelineProcessor` init it can check if the downstream command is `Out-Pager`.  If it is then do `MergeMyResults(PipelineResultTypes.All, PipelineResultTypes.Output)`\r\n\r\nDownside is that it *might* change the order of some things due to the table formatters delay, though the displayed order would be more \"correct\".\r\n\r\n> It's not the least but one of many small concerns. Don't worry about is `test-netconnection`, / `Get-LocalGroupMember` / `Set-clipboard` valid here when Ping, net localgroup or clip do the job. Just like they did 20 years ago. There are cases where you want the Ping objects, or GroupMember objects, but for clipboard or more, where's the benefit.\r\n\r\nFor `clip` I recently forced myself to start using `scb` because of extra new line characters and encoding issues.  `ping` is sort of a loaded scenario because it `Test-Connection` was pretty wonk for some time (ty @vexx32 for fixing it).",
