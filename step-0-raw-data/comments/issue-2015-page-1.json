    "body": "I think the terminal should be responsible for preserving the scroll buffer contents on restart (iTerm2 sort of does this).  However, pwsh could preserve the current working directory location.  I would hesitate on trying to provide full fidelity as people may come to expect it and bad behaviors can happen if it's not 100%.  Instead, make it clear it's NOT anything more than scroll buffer (which PowerShell won't have and can't restore) and working directory.",
