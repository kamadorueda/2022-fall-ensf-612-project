The others talk about PowerShell launching and other things, but fail to identify that `Get-Module -ListAvailable -All` is poorly written and could use some refactoring. There may be things we cannot change due to security consequences, but shouldn't there be investigation to see what we can change, and make sure that performance is optimal without compromising security?",
