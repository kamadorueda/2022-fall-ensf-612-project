With limited bandwidth, this feature was never quite important enough for a small team to implement, but that's not an issue anymore - there are plenty of motivated and capable people who might add this feature now.\r\n\r\nFor anyone willing to tackle this:\r\n\r\n* I think the proposed (and obvious) syntax should work, but you must be careful to not break array references, e.g.\r\n```powershell\r\n$t = [System.Collections.Generic.Dictionary[string,int]]\r\n$t.GenericTypeArguments[0]\r\n```\r\nWhen you first see the `[`, you can't know if you are expecting an expression or a type argument list.\r\n* We will need a new property in [MemberAst](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/053d1808171dd08927554243c2bf665e1121bf48/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/ast.cs#L2864). It might not be obvious why here and not `InvokeMemberAst`, but sometimes you refer to a method without arguments so you can call it later, e.g.\r\n```powershell\r\n$op = \"hello\".PadLeft\r\n$op.Invoke(15)\r\n```\r\nIt's probably not important to support the equivalent for generic methods in the initial implementation, but it is important that the representation support it should we want that in the future.\r\n* This [type](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/fb286e6cf8480fe6df8a5a96311d6758e5c2b9f3/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/MshMemberInfo.cs#L1919) probably needs a new property to hold the specified type arguments, which would get added from the Ast [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/4c29f5768de7a3c5baec932c697d8281adfd3735/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/Compiler.cs#L5430).\r\n\r\nHopefully this is enough to get someone started, if more help is needed, just ask.",

Updating the parser was fairly straightforward, and when I look at the Adapter / DotNetAdapter / PSMethod classes, it's very similar to what I wrote in PSGenericMethods (easy to add some new overloads that accept a list of generic type arguments).\r\n\r\nBetween those, however, I'm getting lost in the Binders / DLR expression tree stuff, trying to figure out the best way to get the new information from the AST over to either DotNetAdapter or PSMethod.  Should there be new fields on binder class(es)?  Do we need to uniquely identify a binder based on the generic type arguments, or just use one binder instance per method / property name (the way it works now) and somehow pass on the generic type arguments so eventually PSMethod.Invoke can identify the right overload?\r\n\r\nWhile looking into this, I came across another possiblity for syntax:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\n# Imaginary generic method that takes one T and two other arguments\r\n$psmethod = [SomeClass]::SomeMethod\r\n$psmethod.InvokeGeneric(@([string]), 'Argument 1', 'Argument 2')\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Names don't matter here, just saying that we'll probably be adding new input to PSMethod's Invoke* method(s) anyway, and may not need to support the `$method = [SomeClass]::SomeMethod[string]` syntax as a result.  `$emptyStringArray = [array]::Empty[string]()` could still be a convenient shortcut for calling it, though. )",

It would be nice if we could have the parser / conversion methods check if the target type is, e.g., `IEnumerable<T>` (where `T` is the same generic type parameter given to the target type we're casting to), and then automatically attempt to first convert anything that is `[object[]]` to `[T[]]` first to ensure the cast will succeed if it is able to. \r\n\r\nIn short, when given:\r\n```\r\n[List[int]] 1..10\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe parser should infer that `[List[int]]` requires a cast to `[int[]]` first and automatically apply the intermediary conversion.\r\n\r\nGiven #11768, we may also want to special case certain types, since `Memory<T>` itself isn't `IEnumerable<T>` but it does contain `Span<T>` which is, and you can already cast `T[]` to `Memory<T>` (I think?).",

I had this issue in mind, but somehow thought it's about new syntax only.\r\nSo speaking of $obj.Method.Invoke - at a glance it's not obvious how it's implemented, but I guess it should use TypeInfo.GetMethod behind the scene. If so, shouldn't we be a step away form getting InvokeGeneric ( basically adding MethodInfo.MakeGenericMethod(types) in the chain)? @vexx32  you mentioned adding such method might need some change in .net core itself, does it mean that PSMethodInfo is using some different mechanism?",

So adding something like your suggestion to it would probably be fairly easy, if you could figure out the necessary code to handle the generic method invocation directly. 🙂 \r\n\r\nIt'd be a public API so at least probably require committee review, but beyond that I don't see anything too difficult about getting that added.\r\n\r\nI would _prefer_ personally just having generic methods work correctly in PS and be able to provide type args with a more c#-like syntax directly, but that's still a step in the right direction; when we eventually get to that point, we'll then have an available method to use to make it work directly that we can just reuse.",
