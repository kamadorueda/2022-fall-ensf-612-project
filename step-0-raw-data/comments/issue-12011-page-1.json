    "body": "Here's what I propose and could use confirmation if this works with your desired behaviors for the install and upgrade experience. /cc @SteveL-MSFT \r\n\r\n1. Simplify upgrades: release versions will upgrade all previous releases, regardless of major versions, e.g. 7 will upgrade 6, 8 will upgrade 6 or 7, etc.\r\n2. Simplify upgrades: release versions will upgrade preview versions for the same major version, i.e. 7 will upgrade 7-preview. The minor version will be ignored, given how upgrades have worked throughout 6 (i.e. only major version mattered).\r\n3. Because of those behaviors, the install directory will not use \"-preview\" because it would be redundant and is something that has to manually corrected in pinned shortcuts, Windows Terminal profiles, and more. Since a preview and release cannot exist on the machine at once (at least for MSI installs), there's no point in having a \"7-preview\" directory, right?\r\n4. Simplify upgrade authoring: WiX recommends you do not hardcode component GUIDs unless you have good reason to. When I was a long-time dev on WiX, we did a lot of work to make auto-GUID'ing work correctly for most cases. As long as the install directory is based on standard directories (it is in your case), the same GUID will be generated for the same path (file or registry), and conversely will be different for different paths. When someone hardcoded the GUIDs to fix the upgrade problem, it was unnecessary. Having the same GUID for components in different directories introduces shared components, [which exhibit all sorts of problems](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/setup/tag/shared-components/).\r\n5. Because component GUIDs will be changed and because it's often safer - if not slightly slower if the same version of files are being replaced - I'll reschedule `RemoteExistingProducts` right after `InstallInitialize`. This will still make the upgrade part of the Windows Installer transaction and can be rolled back if there are any failures during upgrade (i.e. leave customer with previous install in tact), but also allow us to fix the GUIDs.\r\n6. Icons: with all those changes, it now makes it easy to fix the [icon issue][(#11995). The preview icon will be embedded as the icon in pwsh.exe, and the release icon for releases. The icon will still be used for `ARPPRODUCTICON`, but for shortcuts will not be used since the default is the first icon in the product. This means the product icon will be consistent no matter how it's used, e.g. in installer-created shortcuts, user-created shortcuts, pinned shortcuts (i.e. solves the upgrade problem with pinned shortcuts), viewed in Windows Explorer, etc.\r\n\r\nIf we're agreed, I'll make the changes, test the desired changes, and submit a PR.\r\n\r\nTo note, the component GUIDs are something my old team - the Visual Studio Setup team - cleaned up years ago in Visual Studio to simplify not only moving to a new major version, but have a more reliable upgrade experience within a major version (i.e. servicing with major upgrades since MSPs have even more problems). It's quite well tested for both large and small products.",

Directories and files have special casing in Windows Installer, but registry entries will get orphaned if the package is removed that wrote them but the components only get their ref-count (an actual count of which MSIs installed which component GUIDs) decremented, so no MSI knows how to remove them either even if you removed all of them. I'm fixing that by normalizing the components (some are shared and should be, and some need to be split) as well.",
