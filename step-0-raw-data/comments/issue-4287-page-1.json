Quick Solution that respects the Job abstraction:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Get the working directory from the user.\r\n2. Verify that the directory exists\r\n3. Inject in the beginning of the script block that will be executed a 'Set-Location $UserSpecifiedWorkingDirectory'\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Propagate the `$WorkingDirectory` variable all the way up to the `Job level` and specify the working directory there when the process starts\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?

    "body": "I took a deep dive at the codebase and I observed the following:\r\n\r\n#### Creating a new pipeline with a `Set-Location` and adding it to the operations list:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bd6fdae73520931f0d27a29d6290e18761772141/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/commands/StartJob.cs#L610\r\n\r\nJust add this\r\n``` C#\r\nvar command = new Command(\"Set-Location\");\r\ncommand.Parameters.Add(\"LiteralPath\", this.WorkingDirectory);\r\nPipeline tempPipeline = remoteRunspace.CreatePipeline(command.ToString());\r\ntempPipeline.Commands.Add(command);\r\nIThrottleOperation locationOperation = new ExecutionCmdletHelperComputerName(remoteRunspace, tempPipeline);\r\nOperations.Add(locationOperation);\r\n``` \r\nIf you follow this approach then pwsh throws because the second `operation` in `Operations` is trying to open a runspace that is already open (see [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bd6fdae73520931f0d27a29d6290e18761772141/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/commands/PSRemotingCmdlet.cs#L3488))\r\n\r\nIs this the intended behaviour? Can we modify the logic when we try to open the remote the runspace to skip the opening if the runspace is already open.\r\n\r\n#### Adding a `Set-Location` command to the pipeline\r\n\r\nThis would require to either:\r\n\r\n1. Use the `CreatePipeline` function available in `PSRemotingCmdlets` and then insert the command in the beginning. Personally I am not a huge fan of this approach as it would be a bit slow.\r\n\r\n2. Modify the `CreatePipeline` function directly.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bd6fdae73520931f0d27a29d6290e18761772141/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/commands/PSRemotingCmdlet.cs#L1831 \r\n\r\nThis function is consumed by all `PSRemoteCmdlets`. Would the workingDirectory parameter make sense in all of them? Is this an overkill?\r\n\r\n#### Changing the working directory of the pwsh remote server:\r\n\r\n1. The command line argument `workingdirectory` does not work when the pwsh process runs in server mode (`-s` flag). \r\n2. The `InitializationScript` argument is passed to the process `startupInfo` as part of the arguments.\r\n\r\nIf we stick to the implementation of (1) & (2) I do not see how we could have a `workingDirectory` parameter for `Start-Job` that would be able to set the working directory also for the `InitializationScript`. Is this part of the requirement?\r\n\r\nEnabling (1) would allow us to implement the working directory fairly easily since we can add an additional command line argument to when the powershell server process instance is spawned.\r\n",
