    "body": "To further clarify this, without this change, a PSDrive is still created for `/` but that happens later in [`AutoMountFileSystemDrive`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/SessionStateDriveAPIs.cs#L684). However the `root` is not adjusted so in the above case it points to `/dev` but in any case it would point to the first mount in `proc/mounts` and on *nix, `VolumeSeparatedByColon` is not set to `false` which results in malformed path resolution and a `Get-Location` looking like `/:/`.\n",
