The `AppExeCLinks` support was originally added in 7.1. The original `IsWindowsApplication` change was done in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13481 in 7.1 to help determine if a Store application is GUI or CUI executable, based on the `AppExeCLinks` support. Now that the `AppExeCLinks` support is reverted (by design), the check on Store application is broken. So we should consider this for 7.2 GA, or consider backport it in a servicing release for 7.2 later on.",

It's to fix a regression introduced by #16165 in 7.2.0-rc.1. Please review the PR and see if this should be taken for 7.2 GA.\r\n\r\nA simpler fix would be to wrap `File.ResolveLinkTarget` with a try/catch. demonstrated as follows:\r\n```c#\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n    string linkTarget = File.ResolveLinkTarget(fileName, returnFinalTarget: false)?.FullName;\r\n    if (linkTarget is not null)\r\n    {\r\n        fileName = linkTarget;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\ncatch\r\n{\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n@iSazonov's fix could be better in performance, but it's comparatively a larger change than the above, which may introduce unknown side effects.\r\n\r\nWhat about we go with the conservative fix for GA?

Also I see in traces PSStyle too early and expensive initialization (in static InitialSessionState()), ~~but no PR have I~~ the PR is ready too.\r\nThere is System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource expensive initialization. It seems .Net team has an issue for this but we could do something too although it is not trivial and it may require effort.",

PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detetcted.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiaVNhem9ub3YiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTYyOTUiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJUaHVtYnNVcCJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiaVNhem9ub3YiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTYyOTUiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJOZXV0cmFsIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiaVNhem9ub3YiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTYyOTUiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJUaHVtYnNEb3duIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> Why do you exclude File.ResolveLinkTarget from IsWindowsApplication_OLD? Sly! :-)\r\n\r\nYeah, I missed that line of code :) But it also occurred to me that **we don't need that line of code today given that it doesn't work for Windows Store apps (`AppExeCLinks`).**\r\n\r\nThe whole reason that `InternalSymbolicLinkLinkCodeMethods.WinInternalGetTarget(fileName)` was originally [added here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13481/files#diff-f4036ed1a5c3c9f35845bfd272e345992a55ee26e27bdf38446ab9c66e971aafR978-R986) was to fix for the Windows Store apps. You submitted the PR #13481, remember? :)\r\n\r\n`WinInternalGetTarget` was replaced by `File.ResolveLinkTarget` when deprecating `WinInternalGetTarget`, but since there is no documented API to retrieve the actual target of a Windows Store app, there is no point to keep `File.ResolveLinkTarget` anymore. **We can totally remove that for now, until the regarding API gets documented.**\r\n\r\n> What is the reason you are measuring the opposite scenario? This optimization is just for exe files, which is the most common use. Or do you think users prefer to run wt.exe in a loop 100 times per second? :-)\r\n\r\nThe `PEHeader` approach is generally slower than `SHGetFileInfo`, not just `wt.exe`. Directly executing a document to open it with the shell-associated application is also quite common, like an excel, an .txt file, or a word file.\r\n\r\n> Also Windows team doesn't publish APIs for appx. So we can not detect whether it is a console or GUI and so on. Before we could do something useful for appx MSFT must introduce public API for this.\r\n\r\nYeah, both approaches return `false` for Windows Store app, but the `PEHeader` one requires exception handling for that, so it's way slower. Yeah, this is not a common scenario, but like I said, the `PEHeader` is slower in general, for all 4 scenarios tested.\r\n\r\n> I don't see this in PEHeader sources - it seek a offset only.\r\n\r\nI didn't look into the `PEHeader` source, maybe that's caused by creating a `FileStream`.",
