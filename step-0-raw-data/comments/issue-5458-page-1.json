That simplicity is watered down a lot if you have to put a bunch of verbiage around bootstrapping the package management system first.",

I somewhat agree with that one on the basis that the web cmdlets are browser-ish and may need a more rapid iteration cycle to keep up with the ever changing threat dynamics of the interwebs and increasing feature support in CoreFX for non-windows platforms. But I wouldn't want to have PowerShell Core completely void of a download mechanism, though. So would a very simple `Invoke-WebDownload` cmdlet that only has a very very basic feature set with only the ability to save to file (no content processing) with separation of some (or all) of the utility cmdltes make sense?",

After install, a separate command could be run to install key packages straight from PowerShell Gallery. There is precedence for updating built-in via the web with `Update-Help`. For those requiring offline installations, an alternate method may need to be figured out.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to have first-run experience with recommended packages and package collections to install. Maybe a readme on launch with changelog and recommendations. \r\n\r\n@iSazonov there is a Chocolatey GUI that someone created to manage choco packages. That might be a good community project to create if there is demand for it. \r\n\r\n@markekraus I'm uneasy about breaking out JSON and Web cmdlets unless a post-install script sets it up as a standard install. I get the concern about the agile development, but I think we will see faster releases going forward. If not, then maybe breaking it out will be required. They are just such core experiences that I hate to see it not be there by default. ",
