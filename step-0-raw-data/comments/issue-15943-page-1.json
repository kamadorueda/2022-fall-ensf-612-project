But when using right click paste, the terminal has to type the characters to powershell.\r\n\r\nBecause tab is used for completing in PowerShell/Cmd, the tab is consumed as an autocomplete request rather than a character.\r\nYou can see this by running the following and right click pasting:\r\n\r\n    'Get-Proc' + [char]9 + 'Test' | scb\r\n\r\nYou will almost certainly get the text \"Get-ProcessTest\" \r\n\r\nThe issue exists also in Windows Terminal, except Ctrl+V is handled by the Terminal rather than Powershell, so the problem also occurs there.\r\n\r\nGlad we know what the problem is.

Windows Terminal does have a defense in depth feature to try to help here:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7009879/131707158-fb61ea28-19ba-46e3-9c55-b94215231d6c.png)\r\n\r\nBut ultimately this is the clipboard version of the email attachment problem and there's only so much that can be done to prevent users from pulling the trigger on themselves. Anyway, further security discussion is best had [through our security process](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/security/policy).\r\n\r\nAs I say, I think this is an issue of right-click-to-paste being indistinguishable from direct user input, so <kbd>Tab</kbd> is doing exactly what it's configured to in PSRL here.",
