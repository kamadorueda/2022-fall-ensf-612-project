    "body": "> When I say it fails 10% of the time I mean 10 Lambda function invocations that run the same script fail with this error. **The rest of the time it works fine.**\r\n\r\n@normj Thanks for the additional information. Just so I'm clear, when _it works fine_, it was also running in AWS Lambda function environment which is supposed to be the same as those 10 failing invocations, right?\r\n\r\nWhen the env variable `HOME` is not defined, every Runspace startup will try creating a folder in the form of `/tmp/<new-guid>/.local/share/powershell/Modules` as the personal user module path. That means LOTs of such folders get created when `Foreach-Object -Parallel` is dealing with a lot of inputs. In that situation, it may not be surprising to see strange failures like this one. (_maybe we have reached the upper limit to create new directories in `/tmp/` in the Lambda sanbox?_)\r\n\r\nI suggest you to create the `HOME` environment variable in the Lambda function configurations (_you can define arbitrary environment variables for Azure Functions_), and make it maybe point to `/tmp/home`. Then only `/tmp/home/.local/share/powershell/Modules` will be created by the first `Runspace` and it will be reused by the rest of `Runspace` instances created by `-Parallel`. Please give this workaround a try and see how it goes.\r\n",
