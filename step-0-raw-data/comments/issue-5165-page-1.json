    "body": "Hi @thezim: \r\n\r\nGood point about Nano, thank you.  \r\n\r\nNote that PowerShell is not a part of the Nano base container image anymore, and Nano installations as a percentage of Server installations is extremely small, and as a percentage of total machines with PowerShell installed, it is a tiny, tiny fraction of that. Besides, the future of PowerShell on Nano is pwsh, assuimg DevOps-style developers need PowerShell on Nano containers at all (they'll need it on their workstations and CI/CD servers, but perhaps not on the final Nano images outputted).  \r\n\r\nFor \"linear progression\", it's only a progression in version numbering, not in actual capabilities or for backwards compatibility.  Pwsh is not a superset of Windows PowerShell 5.1, it's a smaller subset.  This is where the confusion and disappointment will enter as people \"upgrade\" from 5.1 to 6.0.  If the cmdlets, parameters and other features were the same in pwsh, then I agree that the underlying framework would be irrelevant, but they're not the same at all.  \r\n\r\nThank you for voting!\r\n",

At this time, we are not considering changing the version number.  There are pros/cons to both 6.0 and 1.0, however, as an engine and platform, PSCore6 is a superset of Windows PowerShell 5.1 and for some cmdlets, this is also the case with addition of new capabilities.  Certainly PSCore6 at this time has less cmdlet coverage than Windows PowerShell 5.1, but that will change over time.",
