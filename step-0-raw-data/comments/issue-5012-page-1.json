    "body": "Yes, it is a WiX based installer and quite a simple one, which is great to get started (all you need to have installed is the WiX toolset [here](https://github.com/wixtoolset/wix3/releases/tag/wix311rtm)). I have not started on it yet, so feel free to give it a try and also ask any questions you have. :)\r\nIt is very easy to build the installer via this PowerShell function [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/build.psm1#L1802) and you do not even need to build the whole PowerShell project, you could just point the `-ProductSourcePath` parameter to a bin folder of a dummy project as long as it contains a file named `powershell.exe` (this is just a tip if you want to speedup compilation). When you run it you will see some warnings but you can ignore them. The script will always tell you where the expected MSI will be, even if there was an error, which means if you cannot find the MSI, you need to search for the WiX error in the verbose output.\r\nWhat you will need to do is basically creating and setting registry entries, which means that this action needs to happen in the part where the installer runs with elevated rights, i.e. you will probably need to create a new dialogue with 2 checkboxes. As part of this you will learn that WiX checkboxes to not give you true/false values but instead you need to check if the associated variables value is either set or not.\r\nNote that the example link that I have given at the top uses `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT` but it might be better to use `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`. In terms of registry entries, I found that 2 entries need to be added:\r\n- One in the `Directory\\Background` folder to enable the context menu when right clicking any where in explorer\r\n- Another one in `Directory\\shell` to enable the context menu when right clicking on a specific folder\r\nThe syntax between the 2 will be slightly different\r\n\r\nYou will find that there are already folders named `Powershell` of `Windows PowerShell` in the registry so you will need to come up with a new folder name, so maybe `PowerShellCore6`? Since the installer does not allow side by side installation any more, a version number is not needed at the moment but it might be better since this might change in the future.,",
