    "body": "Thanks for opening the issue @sba923. I've created a simple repro and have verified behaviour in Windows PowerShell 2 on Windows 7, Windows PowerShell 5.1, and PowerShell 7.2. I have also checked the behaviour of cmd, the run dialog box, and git-bash.\r\n\r\nTo expand on what is listed in above: PowerShell behaves the same as cmd and the run dialog when you use `Start-Process`. In all other cases I tested (running `adb`, `. adb`, `& adb`) the error is not emitted outside of `$LASTEXITCODE`. In git-bash an error is emitted, but it is not extremely helpful as it just indicates it couldn't load a file and gives a different exit code:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30301021/141693335-3f0a84d6-271f-4230-8900-0aaf98f6fbb5.png)\r\n\r\nThe repro steps I've used (from an administrative PowerShell window):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nchoco install adb\r\nRemove-Item \"$env:ChocolateyInstall\\lib\\adb\\tools\\platform-tools\\AdbWinApi.dll\"\r\nadb\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote Chocolatey is not  the only way to get adb installed, but it is a pretty quick and painless way to do it.",
