    "body": "Using the Unix utilities, I actually get slightly different behavior, and also differing behavior between platforms:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Set up a temp dir. with subfolder 'subd' and symlink 'subdl' that points to it.\r\nmkdir -p /tmp/$$ && cd /tmp/$$ && rm -rf subd && rm -f subdl && mkdir -p subd && touch subd/file{1..2}.txt && ln -s subd subdl && ls -l\r\n\r\n# Try to remove the symlink with -r and trailing /\r\nrm -r subdl/\r\n```\r\n\r\n### macOS 10.12.4:  \r\n\r\n* The command succeeds (no error message, exit code `0`).\r\n* The _target_ folder is completely removed, and a `subdl` is left behind as a _broken symlink_.\r\n\r\nIn other words: `rm -r subdl/` behaves as if the symlink's _target_ had been passed to `rm -r` (`rm -r subd`).\r\n\r\n### Ubuntu 16.04: \r\n\r\n* The command fails (error message `rm: cannot remove 'subdl/': Not a directory`, exit code `1`).\r\n* `subd`'s _content_ is removed, but the folder itself is retained, as is the symlink.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, both behaviors are in violation of [`rm`'s POSIX spec](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/rm.html):\r\n\r\n> The rm utility removes symbolic links themselves, not the files they refer to, as a consequence of the dependence on the unlink() functionality, per the DESCRIPTION. When removing hierarchies with -r or -R, the prohibition on following symbolic links has to be made explicit.\r\n\r\nI read this to mean: When given a symlink to a directory _on the command line_ with `-r` at least _warn_ that the symlink won't be followed.\r\n\r\n**There's nothing in the spec about how the presence/absence of a trailing `/` affects the behavior, but given that you can usually refer to a directory _interchangeably with or without a trailing `/` (e.g., `ls subd` is the same as `ls subd/`)_, I think the existing Unix behaviors are questionable and not worth adopting in PowerShell.**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
