But not all URIs work like that. One photo site I'm on has URLs in the form\r\n\"https://site.com/userFolder/PictureID/photographer\"\r\nThe extension isn't in the URL at all and the distinctive part is not the final one.  The first is solvable by looking at the mime type but there are always going to be cases where the naming scheme defeats any attempt get a sensible output name.  Its one for discussion - perhaps what you suggest suits a big majority and for the other cases people need to code something which isn't quite so tidy \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote></blockquote>",
