    "body": "I'm not sure that 'edge-case' should be in the vocabulary of a software that tries to pride itself on not having limits (or at least syntax to get around limits).  Since a file name could have a `$`, and since an unquoted command is NOT expandable (without an operator), the fact that the perceived token `$function` is displayed as a variable is misleading.  Its exactly the sort of thing that syntax highlighting is supposed to resolve.  Its the exact reason I have overhauled the PowerShell\\EditorSyntax tmLanguage syntax (open demo PR), and this is the exact reason I have an open PR trying to fix as many of the completion imperfections as I can, because there really shouldn't be any edge-cases.\r\n\r\nI think the issue might be, if for some reason it really does need to be a token independent of the rest of the command name, that the TokenFlags.CommandName is not set on the `$function` token.  However, since the tokenizer knew the first part was a command name, there really isn't any reason for it marking off the `$function` portion as a separate token, its obviously aware of the context.\r\n\r\nI was able to show a correction for the command named `-hello`, because even though it is tokenized as a `Parameter` (I don't necessarily agree with that tokenization either) its also flagged as a `CommandName` so I moved PSReadline's determination of a command name color above that of parameters and now the command/function `-hello` colors as a command.  However, it doesn't work for the command `crazy$function`, the `$function` part is a separate token and not flagged as a command name like the first part is.\r\n\r\nWindows PowerShell with PSReadLine unmodified\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26179051/62345846-79632180-b4b9-11e9-98b3-5f645a375e38.png)\r\nPowerShell 7 with modified PSReadLine\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26179051/62345900-a57ea280-b4b9-11e9-9f16-ce3db5f0f6d6.png)\r\n\r\nI am not however, saying this is more critical than functionality that actually provides work.  There is many parts of that also broken, and probably also being considered 'edge-case'.\r\n\r\nI was able to figure out why this happens.\r\n\r\nThe parser blindly parses nested tokens in a CommandArgumentContext.CommandName condition.   When the parse cleans up going through the AST stage, it makes sure to make the correct AST for the non-expandable token, but since it returns the token for the command as is, the NestedTokens field is still live, which means the token's type is still StringExpandableToken, so PSReadLine then breaks down and colors each token.   If I selectively wipe out the NestedTokens field, I can stop this behavior, and I didn't seem to cause any ill effects.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26179051/62351579-8852cf80-b4cb-11e9-9b1e-039f62e1ed09.png)\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> > @lzybkr, I think, if the flag CommandName was set on a function name token, it would have the side effect of highlighting it as a command, which is probably not desired here (though that's how it works in most syntax highlighting in editors themes, but not all.\r\n> I don't follow. The function names a command, it is invoked as a command, so why should the name token not specify `CommandName`?\r\n\r\n2 problems I see, to clarify why I said that:\r\n\r\n1.  Currently, function names remain highlighted in the default color, not in 'Command' color, a change people could probably accept.  (I notice Class names do get highlighted in the 'Type' color, but then why not method names (in Class) highlighted like members?).\r\n2. To fix the expandable token issue you'd probably be looking at making it so `CommandName` flag never highlights nested tokens, but expandable command names are possible via the `&` operator and they are already marked with `CommandName` flag.   A possibility would be to mark all the NestedTokens of the non-expandable command names with the `CommandName` flag too.\r\n\r\n> I do wonder though if the tokenizer should have some additional context that a command name is expected, which is slightly different than simply being in \"command mode\", in which case nested tokens would never be scanned, just like if the token was enclosed in single quotes.\r\n\r\nI'm finding a reason to be careful here.   While my completion PR demonstrates eliminating using the parser/tokenizer for the basis of argument completions, I'm finding that more difficult for command completions.  However, if I was to go back to using the parser/tokenizer and implement a better CompletionRequiresQuotes method (using the parser), it will be very important that there would be a way to detect the differences between tokenizing a command (where command mode vs expression mode hasn't yet been determined) and an argument (where command mode is for sure).\r\n\r\nIt might be that there could use to be some token testing methods, such as to test 'IsInputSuitableFor[Expandable]CommandName()' and 'IsInputSuitableForArgument()' that could prevent calling up the entire parser, just to see if an input can be represented in a single token unmodified.",
