Otherwise it should be explicitly spelled out in the script if it needs to be sorted there.\r\nWe already have this problem with case normalization. As a result, we have up to 10 times slower file operations. \r\n**All cosmetic goodies should be in the formatting system and yes it should be switchable.**\r\n\r\n\r\n> * The current ordering might not be the right one (particularly `CurrentCultureIgnoreCase`, especially in terms of case-sensitivity on various platforms) and that it shouldn't _yet_ be considered a contract\r\n> * We should discuss ordered filesystem output in a separate issue as an enhancement, and that enhancement should also include a switch to opt out of sorting to enable [performance-conscious scenarios](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3575).

Deviation from this rule generates an infinite number of bugs, of which there are _already a lot in this subsystem_. I'm not saying that we should ignore the properties of file systems and work with EXT4 just like NTFS, but we should not break the general principles on which PowerShell works. \r\nIf these design fundamentals do not meet the user's expectations, he can use other tools.\r\nBut we must not allow the reverse situation where a user is forced to give up PowerShell because we ourselves are destroying its principles. So my script runs for about 5 hours on Windows PowerShell. I've never been able to find out how long it runs on PowerShell Core since I can't wait a _few days_. I would like to use it, but I can't. I would like to make it the fastest, but ... so far everything is being done to make it the slowest, and we've succeeded.\r\n\r\n",
