Although I still think it can be improved by splitting some things and might do so.\r\n\r\n@powercode I used this PR aswell to get a bit used to contributing to powershell, and I chose to tackle an issue which could be fixed with some refactoring. Therefore, I didn't start with analyzing the bottlenecks since I had to set up things yet and wanted to start small by just refactoring some code. I agree with you in the sense that it would make more sense to analyze from a bit higher perspective to find the true bottlenecks. \r\n\r\nSo the next step for me is to test it for performance against the old implementation, after that I'll remove the WIP tag (assuming performance is not worse). \r\nIs there some simple way of checking the performance/runtime by checking the CI runtime results for different branches, or is it better to do some local performance-based-tests myself of the different implementations and report them here?",

For example, replace the `switch` statement with `if/else`; restructure the `case '\"'` block to reduce the nested blocks; adopting `StringBuilder` like you already do.

Readers are made to read lines and characters one-by-one from a String or file and contains some optimized code to do this efficiently. I'm not sure about the reader implementation and can't really back this up, but I do believe `read` will be compiled to something that corresponds with a simple index lookup. \r\n\r\nThen again, as @iSazonov commented, the performance should not really be an issue, \r\n\r\n> This code is very rarely used and only for importing a few aliases. \r\n\r\nSo if it makes a tiny performance boost with the cost of maintainability, I would prefer the better maintainable version, \r\n\r\nAs far as I can see, the method complexity per character read (the different paths per character read which can occur) of your implementation is at 7 (2+4+1 paths). The reader implementation has a complexity of 4 (1 + 2 + 1). \r\n\r\nAlthough I prefer the reader implementation, this might be a matter of opinion, and if the community prefers the `for` loop I'm fine with implementing a `for` loop based implementation. I think the question is whether we agree the `reader` is better maintainable or not.",

    "body": "Since the `csv.cs` is only called in `GetAliasesFromFile()` in `importAliasCommand.cs`, I'm thinking of refactoring `GetAliasesFromFile()`, which I think can be done in a way in which we don't need the seperate `csv.cs` file. \r\n\r\nIt seems `GetAliasesFromFile()` uses readers. This makes sense as a `reader` is able to read a line from a file faster than a `for` loop would be able to. I would say it makes more sense to use a reader as well for the individual line parsing, for the sake of consistency throughout the method. However, according to the discussion on this Pull Requests, using indices are preferred over readers. As I said before, I'm fine with implementing indices instead if that is preferred, but I do want that then we will be mixing two ways of reading which might be more confusing than to use the `reader` for all reading in the method. For now I will assume we prefer to use indices for parsing the individual lines.\r\n\r\nBefore I start with the actual implementation, I want to know if I'm on the same line as the community by asking if we agree on the following, to prevent working on something which is not according to the standards and guidelines used by PowerShell.\r\n\r\n* I want to get rid of having the file called `csv.cs` given its current functionality. I think it is confusing at is is not handling all the csv parsing within PowerShell but does have a very general name. \r\n* Creating the csv file can be called statically. There is no need to create a CSVhelper object to parse a line in the current implementation.\r\n* A check to Ignore blank lines and comment lines is performed in both CSVhelper and `GetAliasesFromFile()` and could be merged such that there's a single point in the code where this violation is checked.\r\n* `GetAliasesFromFile()` is too long and complex and can be split up. Functions can be created for the subprocesses (such as creating the options, creating the alias, checking for violation), such that we reduce complexity and it becomes easier to understand what the code does.\r\n* the error handling is all over the place and could be replaced by a try catch to keep it centralized and to keep it easy to read what the different error outcomes are and how these are handled.\r\n\r\nAs a start, I've spent some time to make some pseudo-ish-code based on the current implementation of what I think is a refactor that makes more sense while keeping the functionality intact. If we agree, I'd like to hear if you want me to open a new one or that I should keep working within this PR since it is all related.\r\n\r\n```\r\nGetAliasesFromFile() {\r\n    result = new collection()\r\n    // linenumber is used for error handling\r\n    Int lineNumber = 0;\r\n\r\n    using (StreamReader reader = OpenFile(out filePath, isLiteralPath)) {\r\n    \tlinenumber = 0\r\n   \t\r\n        while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null) {\r\n        \t++lineNumber\r\n        \ttry {\r\n        \t\t// parse the line, throw exception if invalid\r\n\t\t        parsedLine = parseLine(line)\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// check for any further violations which is able to throw an exception\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\tisValidParsedLine(parsedLine)\r\n\r\n\t\t\t// if valid add to results\r\n\t    \t\tresult.add(constructAlias(parsedLine))\r\n\t    \t} \r\n\t    \tcatch (InvalidLineException e ) {\r\n\t    \t\t// for some cases, like blank line or commented line, we should do nothing and just skip the line\r\n\t\t    } \r\n\t\t    catch (ArgumentException e) {\r\n\t\t    \t// ArgumentException can happen when the options object cannot be created\r\n\t\t    \t// we should write an error, create no alias and continue\r\n\t\t    } \r\n\t\t    catch (NoFourValuesException e) {\r\n\t\t    \t// if not four values, do ThrowTerminatingError(errorRecord) just like old code\r\n\t\t    \t// code below is copy pasted from importAliasCommand.cs\r\n\t\t    \tstring message = StringUtil.Format(AliasCommandStrings.ImportAliasFileInvalidFormat, filePath, lineNumber);\r\n\r\n\t\t        FormatException formatException =\r\n\t\t            new FormatException(message);\r\n\r\n\t\t        ErrorRecord errorRecord =\r\n\t\t            new ErrorRecord(\r\n\t\t                formatException,\r\n\t\t                \"ImportAliasFileFormatError\",\r\n\t\t                ErrorCategory.ReadError,\r\n\t\t                filePath);\r\n\r\n\t\t        errorRecord.ErrorDetails = new ErrorDetails(message)\r\n\t\t\tThrowTerminatingError(errorRecord)\r\n\t\t    }\t\t       \t\r\n        }\t\r\n    }\r\n    return result\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n// this method should correspond with the ParseCsv method in Csv.cs\r\nparseLine(line) {\r\n\tif (line.Length == 0 || OnlyContainsWhitespace(line) || line[0] == '#') {\r\n\t\tthrow new InvalidLineException()\r\n\t}\r\n\t// do the line parsing as implemented in CSVHelper.cs\r\n\t...\r\n\t...\r\n\t// return a collection representing the csv string that is parsed\r\n\treturn result\r\n}\r\n\r\nconstructAlias(parsedLine) throws argException {\r\n\t// create options out of parsed line i.e. a collection object.

    "body": "@iSazonov thanks for your comment and nice to hear it is a permissible community project. So I assume the order would then be to first make tests in a seperate PR (since we have found out the existing tests are not sufficient) and then open up this PR, including the refactorization as I described in my earlier comment.\r\n\r\n> I wonder that you are going to refactor this old and very rarely used code\r\n\r\nI'm curious about the motive of this statement. Since PowerShell embraces backwards compatibility (so regardless of how rarely a feature is used, it should always be in any newer version) we should include old functionality and thus any piece of code can only be replaced with a newer version: there is no discard option. If we consider code to be messy, it will therefore stay messy forever if we don't see the point of cleaning it up. Shouldn't the 'backwards-compatibility' be a motive to refactor any old code if possible, even if it is very rarely used?\r\n\r\n> We should avoid throws if possible\r\n\r\nThe [code guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/coding-guidelines.md) writes the following about throws:\r\n\r\n> Avoid gratuitous exceptions as much as possible. Exception handling can be expensive due to cache misses and page faults when accessing the handling code and data. Finding and designing away exception-heavy code can result in a decent performance win. For example, you should stay away from things like using exceptions for control flow.\r\n\r\nThere are throws in the code already and IMO it makes an easy to read implementation and reduces complexity. I don't think an implementation based on my pseudocode will hurt performance in a significant bad way (besides, it is used rarely) and testing can be done a lot easier. Do you consider the implementation to be \"gratuitous\" exceptions? Because if so I'll go for a different approach.\r\n\r\n> We could consider using code from CSVCommand.cs to parse csv and then remove the parser from csv.cs at all. I don’t like to just rename the file because it violates history.\r\n\r\nI also prefer to remove the parser from `csv.cs` and move/combine all functionality within `CSVCommands.cs`. At the moment the only method in `csv.cs` is the string-parser. If we remove this, there is nothing in `csv.cs` whatsoever. I suggest we will then delete `csv.cs` since the name is confusing.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm planning to work on this PR the next few days, so I hope I can show you something nice by the end of this week.",

Thank you.\r\n\r\nRegarding static methods, I didn't made them static due to the following reasons. I'm not sure why codefactor doesn't pick these up. Let me know if you agree, if so I suspect it is fine for merging.\r\n\r\n* I couldn't change `CreateItemOptions` to static due to a call to the public method `WriteError`. \r\n* `ConstructAlias` uses `Context` at line 434, which is an internal of the abstract class `InternalCommand.Context` and thus can be derived by calling `this.Context`. I changed `Contect` to `this.Context` and now Codacy doesn't complain anymore.\r\n* `IsValidParsedLine` can't be made static due to a call to the public void `ThrowTerminatingError`.",
