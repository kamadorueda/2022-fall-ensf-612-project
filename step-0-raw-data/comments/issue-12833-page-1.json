    "body": "I recently ran into this issue myself. I had to go really deep troubleshooting it to identify exactly what was happening. Once I was sure that I knew exactly the way was broken (Value getting into the parameter but empty in the default end block), only then did I remember `$input` is a magic variable. It is so rare for me to think about that one that it completely slipped my mind when I was fighting the problems it caused. I know I have had similar issues with `$host` in the past.\r\n\r\nThe variable names `$input` and `$host` are very generic and could commonly be used for parameters. The problems presented are different if the parameter is or is not mandatory adding to the confusion.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction test-input{\r\n    param(\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory)]\r\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\r\n        $Input\r\n    )\r\n    if(-not $Input) {\r\n        throw \"This should never happen\"\r\n    }\r\n    \"No issues here [$Input]\"\r\n}\r\nTest-Input -Input \"Test Value\" # exception\r\n\"also fails\" | Test-Input -input \"other\" # also exception\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we remove the mandatory attribute, we get these results that are a more expected if you realize that `$Input` is a special variable:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS> Test-Input -Input \"Definitely not null or empty\"\r\nNo issues here []\r\n\r\nPS> \"CrazyTown\" | Test-Input -Input \"Definitely not null or empty\"\r\nNo issues here [CrazyTown]\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe also need a Script Analyzer rule in the short term for this one.\r\n\r\nEdit: There already are Script Analyzer rules for these. Not sure how I missed it in my case.",

    "body": "This time it was 'Host' which caused troubles for me.\r\nThing is:\r\nA cmdlet named 'Invoke-SQLQuery' with this parameter name ($Host) is in a self written module and was used successfully some months by automated tests under Windows Powershell  5.1.\r\nIt also did not run into problems on a machine where we use Powershell Core 7.0.x for evaluating purposes (we want to switch to Core generally).\r\nThen the test which uses this cmdlet was changed slightly (an command line utility now gets called some lines BEFORE the call to 'Invoke-SQLQuery' and from that time on it started to crash the test on the machine where Core is used, but still not on the other machines.\r\nThe test writers looked into the issue and at the end came to me, because they couldn't find out what was going on in this case.\r\nMy first thought was: Must be the newly added 2 lines of code where the command line utility gets called and its output processed.\r\nI commented those lines out and voil√° - everything worked again!!! (As said, those 2 lines are BEFORE the code where ''Invoke-SQLQuery' gets called!)\r\nSo for sure I wanted to check which of those two newly added lines caused the trouble.\r\nI then re-enabled the line which would process the output (already initialized with a short string).\r\nStill no crash - as expected, because this just did a replace in the string and I anyway thought it would be the call of the external command line tool.\r\nThus I did it the other way around:\r\nI re-enabled the line with the call to the command-line tool and out-commented the string processing line and expected to get into troubles again.\r\nBut all went well!\r\nThen enabled both lines again and the crash was back - it happened at some point where the module containing 'Invoke-SQLQuery' is in got loaded, but I was not really able to exactly determine the place/line where it occurred - but it was NOT at the beginning of 'Invoke-SQLQuery'.\r\nThe error message said something about 'reference to object' and each time I reached that point I had to close 'Visual Code', because stopping the debugger didn't work...\r\nHours later 'Host' as a parameter name to 'Invoke-SQLQuery' got my attention - I renamed it to 'HostName' and from that point everything was back to normal...",
