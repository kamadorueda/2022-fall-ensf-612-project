I am not able to remember and type without making mistakes this new template. (I guess two weeks later you will not be able to remember it too)\r\n3. A lot more tests require fixes. You find and fix only the smaller part of the tests. I found about 60 files. (I searched by `throw \"` pattern). There are interesting templates:\r\n -1. `Throw \"Previous statement unexpectedly succeeded...\"`\r\n -2. `throw \"Execution should not have reached here\"` \r\n -3. `throw \"Command did not throw exception\"`\r\n -4. `throw \"expect Import-PSSession to throw\"`\r\n -5.\r\n```powershell\r\n    try {\r\n        & $sb\r\n        throw \"Expected FullyQualifiedErrorId: $expectedFqeid\"\r\n    }\r\n    catch {\r\n        $_.FullyQualifiedErrorId | Should Be $expectedFqeid\r\n    }\r\n```\r\nIt seems the latter is most accurate but somewhat redundant and complex.\r\nI would prefer `No exception!` or at worst `Previous command should be throw!`",

As long as the message clearly describes the scenario in the test failure log, then that should be sufficient. As you point out, there are different ways of applying the pattern and scrict adherence to that specific message may not always make sense (as shown in your example 5).",
