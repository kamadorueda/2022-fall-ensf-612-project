Your build exited with 0.\r\n\r\n/Users/travis/.travis/job_stages: line 166: shell_session_update: command not found\r\n\r\n\r\nNo output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.\r\nCheck the details on how to adjust your build configuration on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received\r\n\r\nThe build has been terminated\r\n```\r\nGiven that, I will merge the PR.",
