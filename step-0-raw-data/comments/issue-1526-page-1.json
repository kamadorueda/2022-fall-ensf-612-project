While we do need to run only a subset of tests, by whitelisting we risk people adding tests, not tagging them, seeing the build pass, and assuming their tests were run. We need a procedure to ensure people adding tests tag them appropriately, but in the basic scenario where they add a test and push to run it on CI, they should be probably be able to do so without tagging it.\n\nIs it possible to warn if there are tests without tags? I think that would be a good compromise.\n",
