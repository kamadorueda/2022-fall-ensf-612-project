    "body": "> Feature request: make all of the numbers on the public objects settable\r\n\r\nThe AST is immutable by design, allowing these properties to be set would be counter to that.  Even though the parser won't produce `ScriptExtent`'s, they can still be passed to the constructors of every AST. That said, creating `ScriptExtent`'s is definitely a chore.\r\n\r\n> Bug: stop returning Internal objects from public APIs (in this case, Parser.Parse)\r\n\r\nThey're internal only in implementation detail.  They implement `IScriptExtent`, and that's what the property returns.  They are used instead of `ScriptExtent` because they all access the same `PositionHelper` (a small class that stores the full script, and a map of line start offsets) which lets it reduce size per object and also save some common calculations (like the map of line start offsets).  If you want to cast it to something, cast it to the interface.\r\n\r\nI'd love for there to be a similar API for public use, or just better tools for managing extents. I believe `InternalScriptExtent` is non-public because it's pretty obtuse to use outside of the parser itself.",
