I think what I've found frustrating over the last 5 years of using PowerShell is you think it's gonna do what you want, but then it doesn't. And then you're surprised, and little sad :). I just read about how PowerShell's `ConvertTo-Json` defaults the `-depth` to 2, whereas JavaScript doesn't. I've been bitten by this \"bug\", too.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment\r\n\r\nSo, my question is, does PowerShell have a design principle that things just \"work\"? That the defaults are \"good\"?

The reason the default is there is because there are some common objects in PS that have recursive references, which would quickly confuse the heck out of the JSON serializer and you'd end up with a lot of duplicate data.\r\n\r\nI definitely agree we should strive for the principle of least astonishment as much as possible. The difficulty here is that there's not really a good solution to solve this other than perhaps going back and overwriting the header in the file a bunch of times if the cmdlet finds extra properties during processing that aren't present on the first object... That also comes with performance overhead, as inspecting every object's properties and comparing them to the base set is not necessarily cheap. You go from one set of property lookups per pipeline to as many property lookups as there are objects, and that gets quite expensive very quickly and will slow down processing quite a bit.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm all for solving it, I think it should be solvable. I just don't see a good way to do so in this cmdlet. 😕 ",

Or, do you have to read the manual (not the one on your machine, the one online)?\r\n\r\nInitial design for JSON cmdlets was for using in interactive sessions. As result there is default depth 2 and converting all over the depth to strings.\r\nModern user expectations is changed to Web scenarios and we concluded to change the default.\r\nAlso .Net Core now has new JSON API and we plan to migrate from NewtonSoft to the new API.\r\n> recursive references\r\n\r\nThis will be resolved to with new API, and more.

I was asking in general about PowerShell -- not just in regard to JSON on arrays or hashtables. Maybe it's my fault. I've been using JavaScript for 20 years, so that's \"normal\". When I use another language, I expect it to \"work like JS\", but maybe it doesn't. It's tricky when two languages seem to do the same thing, but there's subtle (or not to subtle) differences.
