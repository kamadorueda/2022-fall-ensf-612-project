    "body": "Constants are pretty rare in PowerShell; once they're defined in a session they're basically impossible to remove no matter what you do. Given an administrative context, true constants are almost never needed or desired in most situations that come to mind as common uses of PowerShell. ReadOnly variables are _much_ more common, because should the need arise you can still remove them from the session using `Remove-Variable -Force`\r\n\r\nThat being said, however, I agree that Constant and ReadOnly variables should be able to be declared in a more intuitive fashion. In proper terms, these are typically registered as attributes attached to the internal PSVariable object, and their internal representation is _somewhat_ similar to type-constraining a variable (e.g., `[string]$Word = \"banana\"`). As such, I'd probably think that rather than using up a keyword for this, a specific attribute typing is a little more appropriate to the use here, something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[PSConstant]$Million = 1e6\r\n[ReadOnly]$ConfigVar = @{Name = \"John\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's kind of the idea I think would be most straightforward to add in, and is in my opinion one of the more apropos forms this could take. ðŸ™‚ ",

It came up today in the PS discord community and I dug this one up.\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, we have a couple options:\r\n\r\n1. Keyword: `const $var = $value` ; `readonly $var = $value` \r\n2. Attribute: `[const()]$var = $value`; `[readonly()]$var = $value`\r\n3. Provider syntax: `$const:var = $value`; `$readonly:var = $value`\r\n\r\nWould appreciate some input from others here too, and if there're other ideas on it, more than welcome. This would go a long way towards the usability of const/readonly variables. You don't need 'em often, but when you do they tend to be a pain to add compared to regular variables.",

A drive with the name 'const' does not exist.\r\nC:\\Users\\jaiello> $readonly:var = 'var'\r\nObjectNotFound: Cannot find drive.
