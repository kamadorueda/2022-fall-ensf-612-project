PowerShell 6.0? 7.0? Latest LTS version? Latest version?\r\n\r\nIt's based on what tests you are looking at. For CI regression tests, the baseline would be the results from the run without the PR changes. For high level regression tests, the base line would be the results from a previous preview, or a previous stable release.\r\n\r\n> Has MSFT team a roadmap for adding perf tests? I believe we need a perf test set with good code coverage.\r\n\r\nNo, we are still figuring things out. I also reached out to @adamsitnik for guidelines on performance testing in general.\r\n\r\n> Will perf tests be mandatory in new PRs to avoid perf regressions?\r\n\r\nIdeally, we will enable the perf test for CI, so that we know what's getting better/worse with the changes. We can leverage what dotnet team has for this, but the first thing for us is to have a good suite of perf tests.",
