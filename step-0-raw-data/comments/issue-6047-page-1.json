In general it does not hurt that much, because the scripts are executed once every morning to build the packages for the day. However since big packages take more than 2 minutes to be copied and zipped I wondered if there can be done some optimization.\r\nThe actual script execution time is only 0,5s :D although it does a lot of business logic using a PowerShell class, a cmdlet with dynamic parameters, bla bla bla :D",
