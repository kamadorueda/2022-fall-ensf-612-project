I get that they want to push people to use authentication, but NAT is a thing and using an IP address for rate limiting this low is painful. \r\n\r\nIt doesn't look like GitHub has a device grant flow for OAuth, so there are no secret-less read-only grants available. If we did include some kind of OAuth, the rate limit would be increased, but, this would also now apply to all consumers of `install-powershell.ps1`, and not just AppVeyor.\r\n\r\nWe could incorporate retry logic. It looks like the use the `X-RateLimit-Reset` header. At the very least it could try sleeping until the reset. but.. that could be up to an hour. The CI's do not like long naps.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe asking GitHub to be more lenient with AppVeyor's IPs is the best path? hmm",
