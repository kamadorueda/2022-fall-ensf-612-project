    "body": "Well, first of all I'm new to PS and I can simply be wrong. So I beg an\napology in advance. Though to my understanding the way objects and tools\nprovided to work with those objects are presented a bit copy-pasty. At\nleast as far as \"Powershell in depth\" and help go describing them. Like -\nI'm trying to understand what I'm not understanding and I'm failing to do\nso. Basically you can give Get-Member and output of a cmdlett that will be\nparsed as objects and combined all together as methods, properties, etc but\nto parse a specific object to get-member - nah, let's not even mention this\npossibility. We only work in bulks apparently :). Like - isn't it the next\nquestion that is popping in your head when you are learning it - how do I\ntransfer a single object to \"gm\" instead of the whole group of objects\n(get-process/get-service/import/etc) which I have zero ways defining what\ngoes in (except filters I guess?) - so the information \"gm\" gives me is\ngeneralized to say it kindly :).\n\nthe core reason of the rant - Jeffrey and Don trashing BASH openly again\nand again while it's so much more convenient than Powershell. Yes, its text\nand not objects and objects are way cooler - I agree. But as long as you\ndon't shove at me the way I can separate a single object from\n\"get-service/get-process\" and pipe it to get-member - as far as I'm\nconcerned the object oriented part is useless - at best. I don't want to\nremember what sticks where (and I have a pretty good memory - it's not what\nbugs me). I want to understand and cut to the flash. As far as I saw it is\npresented to some degree, and I could be wrong generally, but again as far\nas I saw, those aren't the things that a thrown at you as a student of PS\nand those are most important things to understand, cause those are the\nbasics of the PS. Those are the building bricks. Instead of it PS is\npresented as \"something you don't need to be a programmer to use\" and it\nfeels really flat to me - cause it seems as the explanations are simplified\nto not fear \"non programmer\" folk away (and I didn't know what IP address\nis three years ago working at construction. So if this feels flat to me -\neither I'm a moron (possible) or it was simplified too much (my bet)). So\nnow I have to stop and try to understand - am I a moron, who doesn't\nunderstand the written English or those things are simply not being\nmentioned at the the needed depth both in the help and in the book written\nby authors of PS. Which is - frustrating :). Cause I don't want to move\nfurther if I missed the basics. It feels like I did but nothing it the book\nsays so - except as I've said \"kindly\" in the first place - \"for more\nunderstanding search: <system.diagnostics.process>\". And the only result\nyou get is related to .Net. So the idea of not being a programmer (have\nnothing against of being a programmer for using PS) is quite misleading :)\n\nOn Mon, 18 Mar 2019 at 17:28, vexx32 <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> @tetrismasters <https://github.com/tetrismasters> I can understand the\n> frustration to some degree, but wouldn't it be much better served by\n> pointing out where it could be made better? 泗\n>\n> 窶能n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub\n> <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9159#issuecomment-473959481>,\n> or mute the thread\n> <https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/AoSfIybAxYjw8AUHWd0yEHstU5d55a88ks5vX7CigaJpZM4b50f2>\n> .\n>\n",

    "body": "Okay, let's see....\r\n\r\nSo, with `Get-Member`, the way you'd give it a single object is essentially identical to how you'd give it multiple. Really, the only difference is what you choose to give it. `Get-Member` gives you an outline of everything that object can get for you, but it doesn't typically get that data for you.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for, for example, \"I want a list of the object(s) properties and what the value is for each of them\", Get-Member can only really tell you the property _name_. If you want name and value all neatly laid out for you to see, it might be more effective to look at it by piping to `Format-List`. And if you just want to select a single item from a collection there are several ways to do so. Here's one:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# (or pipe to `Get-Member` if you prefer!)\r\nGet-Process | Select-Object -First 1 | Format-List\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn short... `Get-Member` doesn't control what goes in, the cmdlets before it do, and in many ways you do. It can definitely be a bit much at first, I agree, and reading through documentation isn't for everyone. (I personally enjoy just reading docs endlessly and have done so for PowerShell, .NET, SkiaSharp, etc., etc. but that's really not an approach most people find friendly.)\r\n\r\nBash is a great tool, but in a sense it can't do a whole lot. Take away the discrete binaries, and Bash itself is pretty limited. In comparison, PowerShell has a _ton_ built in, and if you want to call back to the native utilities and do the text processing instead, that's still available. I've not really heard that many folks openly _trashing_ Bash, but I can definitely see that in some ways a few folks tend towards speaking that way and it can be very easily misunderstood without further context. Without knowing exactly what you've heard and who you've seen, I can't really say more. 泗 \r\n\r\nI disagree that PowerShell is something you \"don't need to be a programmer to use\".... _sort of_. It's a **fantastic** entry point, even if you've never learnt any programming before. It's very flexible, you don't need to go through the hassle of compiling anything, it's largely a standalone tool with all its dependencies built in, very little to worry about from the user end.... but you _will_ end up learning bits and pieces of programming as you go, and you'll need to. \r\n\r\nIn many ways, you can't progress beyond certain points in learning PS until you've grasped some concepts. And, largely, I think that's OK-- it's better to require some understanding of the tool. PS is a _ridiculously_ powerful tool, and it needs to be understood on a certain level before you know enough to completely wreck a system in most cases, and I think that's probably _wise_.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to be the sort of fellow who learns most effectively by doing and experimenting, I've put together a bit of a guided tour of the things PowerShell can do and how you can work with it, if you're interested.\r\n\r\nhttp://aka.ms/pskoans\r\n\r\nOf course, if you have any questions... don't hesitate to ask. 沽 ",

    "body": "> Basically you can give Get-Member and output of a cmdlett that will be parsed as objects and combined all together as methods, properties, etc but to parse a specific object to get-member - nah, let's not even mention this possibility. We only work in bulks apparently :)\r\n\r\nIn this specific example, what is the goal of splitting out a single object? All objects returned are expected to be of the same type, so whether you use `gm` on an entire collection of `[System.Diagnostics.Process]` or a single one will yield you the same result.\r\n\r\n> Jeffrey and Don trashing BASH openly again and again while it's so much more convenient than Powershell.\r\n\r\nIt is more convenient than Bash. What you're thinking of Bash and what Bash actually is are two separate things. Bash does not include commands like `find`, for example. Those are usually packaged up as part of `coreutils` or, more generally, GNU Utils. Whether you find Bash + gnutils to be more convenient than pwsh is, of course, subjective.\r\n\r\n> But as long as you don't shove at me the way I can separate a single object from \"get-service/get-process\" and pipe it to get-member - as far as I'm concerned the object oriented part is useless - at best.\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't see what the purpose of getting a single object out of the pipeline is. Perhaps you could elaborate?\r\n\r\nThe pipeline (chains of commands) is always assumed to be working on collections of objects that flow from left to right. If you want to inspect the contents of a collection, you can easily save the output to a variable and then iterate over that variable. For example:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n$ps = Get-Process\r\n$ps[0] # Get details of the first process\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, you could also do this to get the same result:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\nGet-Process | Select -First 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr even something fun like this:\r\n```pwsh\r\n# Get all processes with an ID greater than 80.\r\nGet-Process | Where-Object { $_.Id -gt 80 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I want to understand and cut to the flash. As far as I saw it is presented to some degree, and I could be wrong generally, but again as far as I saw, those aren't the things that a thrown at you as a student of PS and those are most important things to understand, cause those are the basics of the PS.\r\n\r\nYou seem to be trying to run before you can walk (which I can understand to be frustrating!). The pipeline in `pwsh` is a very powerful tool and you seem to be trying to tease it apart without fully understanding it. Perhaps some further reading may help? @vexx32 may have some suggestions there.",

    "body": "Guys, I truly appreciate your replies. I don't think PS is bad - quite the\nopposite. I was actually surprised that it's not as bad as I thought it\nwould be - more than that it seems kinda good and therefore I want to learn\nit properly. I'm not comparing BASH to PS - Jeffrey and Don do - the guys\nwho are responsible for PS3 if I'm not mistaken :)\n\nwhy would I want to put a single object to get-member instead of the array\nthat \"get-process\" gives me - just as a proof of a concept. To assure that\nI'm understanding correctly what's happening. The problem is not how it\nworks but how it is mentioned in docs. The results being the same for a\nsingle object and for the collection of objects of the same type was my\nfinal guess but here's the problem - it was a guess :). It's not mentioned.\nQuite the opposite (unless - English bad), in \"Powershell in Depth\" its\ndescribed as get-member gives you all the methods and properties of objects\nthat get-service/whatever is piping to it. That makes you think that\nservices/processes can have different attributes and get-member will give\nyou the combined results of all the different methods and properties of the\nobjects that were piped to it. So the next logical thing for you (as a\nstudent) to do is piping a single process to get-member (which I've\ndescribed as \"I guess you can make it with a filter\") and check if it gives\nyou a different result. And you totally described how it can be done and\nI'm totally gonna try it tomorrow :)\n\nThe book I'm reading is \"Powershell in Depth\" by Don Jones and Jeffrey\nHicks. It's not bad, but as I've said it feels a bit of an \"under-kill\".\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant, thank you for your time. Brandon answered my\nquestion - the results being the same for a single process and for\nget-process. Which is, again, not something you cannot think of - it's just\nnot something that is not mentioned and to me, it was the first thing\npopping in my mind - will it work the same for a single object. M.b. I'm\nthe only one who's brain is twisted like that or I'm just dumb not\nunderstanding the obvious things. Or too Russian :). It is all a\npossibility.\n\nAnd I guess I'm being annoying regarding this part, because to me this\nfeels like a cornerstone of PowerShell. As the most important concept to\nunderstand.\n\nAgain thank you all for your time and - I do enjoy PowerShell itself :)\n\nOn Mon, 18 Mar 2019 at 18:43, Staffan Gustafsson <notifications@github.com>\nwrote:\n\n> @tetrismasters <https://github.com/tetrismasters> Maybe you can fill us\n> in with what you have read so far when trying to learn PowerShell.
