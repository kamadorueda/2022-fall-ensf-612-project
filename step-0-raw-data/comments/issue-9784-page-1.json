For example, the new Windows \"terminal\" requires the latest update (1903 IIRC.) And then there are all the different Linux distros. The tricky bit of course is getting that detailed information since \"uname -a\" doesn't return the distro name or version.\r\n\r\n(On a related note; on Windows there is already the CompatiblePSEditions field for Desktop and Core that is (now) enforced).

    "body": "I agree adding a new PSD1 field that prevents importing on earlier versions is not ideal and would hurt adoption. Since PowerShellGet is getting rewritten with PS7 I mentioned in [PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC#185](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/185/files/237f4c4b379480660ca317c230c5775610827296#r289590558) that may be good to move the built-in module (`*-Module`) commands to PowerShellGet. This would allow older PS versions to make use of enhancements and import any new PSD1 fields.\r\n\r\n> When this change is made, built-in `*-Module` commands should be updated to support `semver` as well as `[System.Version]` (for backwards compatibility). If the built-in commands are updated that brings up a question about how will older versions of PowerShell handle that. There are issues with the current paradigm of trying to force semver into a system that doesn't support it. We get issues like [PowerShell/PowerShellGet#324](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/324) and [PowerShell/PowerShellGet#204](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/204).\r\n> \r\n> What will be the minimum PS version supported for `PowerShellGet` v3? If it's less than PS 7 then it may be worth breaking out the built-in `*-Module` commands from PowerShell into `PowerShellGet` to add support for semver in older PS versions.",
