    "body": "Much of what's needed to implement this feature is already implemented in the compiler to support the trap statement.\n\nThe generated code for a script turns into a big switch statement so we can jump to a specific statement after processing a trap.\n\nI believe the debugger can simply compute which statement a particular line corresponds to, and set a field in the function context, then this functionality should more or less work. I'm sure I'm missing some tricky aspects, but I think the hardest part was already implemented.\n",
