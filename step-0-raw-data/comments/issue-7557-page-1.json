My initial reaction to 'y' for byte was ?? but it's grown on me (and fsharp uses it.) We've talked about allowing `_` in numeric literals before and decided against it due to concerns with how it would fit into the ecosystem. Values move between strings and numbers in a lot of places in PowerShell and we were concerned that introducing `_` might result in an inconsistent experience, especially for decimal numbers. (We also do things like hold on to the string representation of a numeric literal passed as an argument to a parameter of type object in case the user really meant a string.) It would be irritating if `123_456_789'` worked but `[int] \"123_456_789\"` did not.  Likewise with `[int]::Parse(\"123_456_789\")`. However, for binary literals, `_` is much more important and binary literals are not supported by the ecosystem anyway, so yeah - at least for binary literals we should support `_`. (Hmm - maybe we can do a PR into CoreFX to get the parse methods to support `_` , especially now that C# supports it.) And should we be strict with `_` placement or just allow any number of `_` characters? `0b__________________1` looks weird to me but it is it \"bad\"?",

    "body": "I don't think there's any particular reason to be overly restrictive about the syntax. Currently with hex notation in my test implementation, it *does* require that you start a hex sequence with `0x<digit>` before using an underscore (so `0x_1` isn't valid but `0x10___01` is fine), but changing that would not be insanely difficult.\r\n\r\nI can certainly see reasons to avoid implementing it in standard digit parsing, but as you say -- C# already supports it; I don't see a reason not to allow it. As for parsing strings manually, it would be nice to have that consistent from CoreFX's end, though even presently in C# `Int32.TryParse()` doesn't seem able to handle digit strings with underscores. It seems more implemented as a utility for the programmers rather than users in any fashion.\r\n\r\nHowever, with PS bringing scripters and users much closer, not requiring source to be compiled... it would make a decent amount of sense to just tweak the parsers to ignore those characters in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nI also would tend to cast my vote for `y` and `sy` for byte; and bytes *are* unsigned by default in C#. It mightn't be consistent with other type names, but it is how C# operates with byte types.",

They're not available via `TryParse` and must instead be accessed via `Convert.To([S]Byte|[U]Int16|[U]Int32|[U]Int64)`. There are no `Decimal` or higher conversions available, but it seems to be a relatively safe method of conversion, provided we can ensure the digits provided are indeed binary -- which is currently handled well with a similar function as `ScanHexDigits()`\r\n\r\nSo... it works. Whether it's quite what we're after, I'm not so sure. Do we want binary literals to automatically parse as `byte` if they're 8 characters long, etc., or do we just leave that to suffixes and otherwise parse normally?\r\n\r\n(Doing so would end up being a bit complex, I think, maybe unnecessary logic for the parser to put up with? Especially considering multiplier values... hm.)",

    "body": "Gotcha~\r\n\r\n@iSazonov Been working on it a bit, looking at implementation details... Got it working quite well at the moment. Been talking it over with the folks in the PS Slack, and I'm thinking it probably makes the most sense for *binary* conversions to follow the bit length of the string. 8 binary bits (or less) and we work with `sbyte`s and `byte`s and such.\r\n\r\nBasically... I have it following this pattern (currently):\r\n\r\n* Hex literals are either `int`, `long`, `decimal`, or `BigInteger` depending on the length of the string (and will `uint`/`ulong` with `u` suffix).\r\n  * Parsing hex string suffixed `u` at large values fails (because no type higher than `UInt64` *is* unsigned)\r\n  * `u` suffix will change the value if the high bit is a sign bit (8, or 16-length strings matching Int32 or Int64)\r\n* Binary literals are either `sbyte`, `short`, `int`, or `long`. Any longer binary string (>64 chars) cannot be parsed with the baked in .NET conversions available and will fail.\r\n  * A `u` suffix will push the conversion to `byte`, `ushort`, etc.; these conversions *will* differ from their unsigned counterparts due to how .NET treats the signing bits: `0b1111_1111` is `[sbyte]-1` but `0b1111_1111u` is `[byte]255`.\r\n  * Sign bits at 8,16, 32, and 64 length binary strings are respected, *if* an unsigned suffix is not supplied.\r\n* All hex and binary literals have underscore support\r\n  * `0b0000_0001` and `0x0000_0001` are valid, but consecutive underscores are not parsed as numerics: `0b00__001` is treated as a command name instead.\r\n    * `0b01_` is also treated as a command name (trailing underscore not permitted)\r\n* All suffixes and multipliers can be used against hex or binary strings\r\n  * Should the multiplier overflow the MaxValue normally assigned to that length of string (i.e., an 8-digit binary would normally parse as `byte`) it will fail to parse. \r\n  * Should the suffix box the type into a 'too-small' type, it *will* correctly cast if the value of the string is within the requested type's value range: `0b1111_1111_1111_1111` registers as `short` with value `-1`. But appending `y` to the string *will* yield an `sbyte` value of `-1`.\r\n\r\nI'm still a little on the fence with some of these points. It seems to be pretty consistent with what I'd think is expected for a binary parser, but ultimately I will of course defer to your guys' judgement. Frankly, it's *less* trouble to just parse to `int32` and respect sign bits of small values appropriately regardless, but... yeah.",

If we add numeric delimiter like underscore this can confuse users which will expect culture delimiter. This happens now with the datetime formats. \r\nSecond concern is that supporting underscore only in hex and binary again can confuse users which will expect that we support the delimiter in all numerics.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest _to postpone the underscore support_ until we collect many community feedbacks.\r\n\r\nAs for parsing. I am sure that we must follow the _current logic_. \r\nIt means:\r\n1. If suffix define target type we should fail if overflow.\r\n2. Without type suffix we shouldn't limit and should convert up to BigInteger even for binary, hex and unsigned (we can always add leading zero to get unsigned numeric (BigInteger too)).\r\n\r\n",

Decimal, Double, and BigInt simply don't have the conversion methods available.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I could roll a parser for such a thing, but in trying to do so I ran into a bit of a stumbling block: the existing conversion methods use the two's complement method of dealing with the sign bit, and frankly I don't really understand how they do it. Every example I've found (so far) of two's complement conversions seems to give me differing results to how the .NET methods handle it.\r\n\r\nThis is primarily going to be input in console or scripts that this will be handling, so I would be very surprised if anyone was going to go the sheer effort to put together a binary literal over 64 characters in length. Given that C# has no support for extremely large binary literals, should we?\r\n\r\nI suppose it's a matter of does the parity matter here; I doubt anyone's going to be handling giant hex literals either, but in that case it's significantly easier to do, and the numeric TryParse methods have an easily available conversion method that works for BigInteger without much tweaking.",

If we add new input format (underscope? culture delimiter?) users will ask why we don't add output format (underscope? culture delimiter?). _Initially we only consider underscope for script constants but we is still interactive_.\r\n\r\n>The tricky part with binary going higher than (U)Int64 is that... there are no available conversion methods for a binary numeral that high.

We could look Roslyn code.\r\n\r\n>Given that C# has no support for extremely large binary literals, should we?\r\n\r\nC# is strong typed. It must limit/overflow.\r\nAs I said we should follow the same logic for all numerics to avoid confusing users. I would be very surprised if I wrote a number of one hundred '1' then added a prefix '0b' and got an error although the number would be less then first one!\r\n(Sometimes users do amazing things like games on Excel or PowerShell and we should not artificially limit them)\r\nIf we want limits we should remove BigInteger at all - I do not think that someone is studying astronomy on PowerShell :-)\r\n",

Underscores are permitted *between* two numeric characters only.\r\n  * Works: `0x0_1` `0b110_001` `1_99_0_0` `1_2e1_2`\r\n  * Parsed as generic token: `25__01` `_0x2` `0_x2` `1_` `0b1_` `0x_1`\r\n* Byte suffix `y` for signed byte, can be added to `u` as `uy` for standard byte.\r\n* BigInteger suffix `I` (yes capital I only) to designate any numeric literal to be handed back as BigInteger.\r\n  * Yes, it's a bonus. Parser already uses it for non-`real` numerics anyway, so we may as well make it useful, and it has a short type accelerator already.\r\n\r\nAnd I refactored a *bunch* of the numeric parsing to cut down the number of `TryParse` calls to *three* (one for decimal, double, and bigint) and then use helper functions to safely just cast into lower types as needed.\r\n\r\n(You bet I'm reusing this comment for the PR description in large part, ha!)",

I'd really rather *not*, heh. It's just far more messy and error-prone than I think anyone would want a binary parsing method to be.\r\n\r\nWell, the code is written as well as it can be to my eyes, so I'll strip it down to the approved specifications and we'll go from there.

Some of the slower possible methods we've come up with (he's been doing a lot of the tinkering here) are still about twice as fast as `Convert.ToIntX()` methods, even with smaller numbers. 😄 \r\n\r\nBeyond that, we're subdividing nanoseconds finding quicker methods, so I think I can call that \"good enough\" for the forseeable future!",

    "body": "Re use of _only_ uppercase `I` for `[bigint]`, quoting https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/7993#issue-222151965\r\n\r\n> Adds support for natively returning a biginteger with no rounding using the I (capital i) suffix. I elected to use \"big i\" and exclude \"little i\" as that is generally reserved in mathematics for imaginary numerals and could be confusing to some.\r\n\r\nWhile lowercase `i` can indeed get confusing, I suggest not introducing an inconsistency by making the `I` suffix the lone exception in terms of case-sensitivity.\r\n\r\nWhile it makes sense to _document and recommend_ the use of uppercase `I`, and to use it in _examples_, I suggest _accepting_ `i` too, for symmetry with all other type-suffix characters.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could pick a different character - has `n` been considered? (It is pretty much the only other letter left that doesn't cause outright confusion; any letter we choose is technically a breaking change in argument mode).\r\n\r\n",
