I've seen a few websites in the past where it turns text into the \"smart\" variant and things like `-` becomes an em-dash and quotes become their \"smart\" variants. You only have to search [powershell em-dash encoding](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=powershell%20em%2Ddash%20encoding) to see people falling afoul of the unicode variants of the ASCII characters and I wouldn't think it's a stretch to consider quotes being part of this umbrella. Storing code in a word document, while not very ideal, is something I've seen people do and word typically likes to change the characters to the smart variant as well.\r\n\r\nJust wanting to put it out there that if the decision is made to stop treating [these chars](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/b7cb335f03fe2992d0cbd61699de9d9aafa1d7c1/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/CharTraits.cs#L18-L24) as quotes then we need to be aware that this could break existing code. This has been in place since the Windows PowerShell days so it's something that's lived with PowerShell since the early days.\r\n\r\nOf course I'm just a lone voice here, it's up to the working group to decide the next step forward :)",

In fact generally speaking I dont think Microsoft Word should be mentioned in the same breath as PowerShell, as they are wholly different platforms.\r\n\r\nA lot of blogs did as well, at least at the time.  I believe it was to make it easier to copy and paste examples from blogs like that. PowerShell early on had a lot of \"wouldn't it be cool if __ just *worked*?\" that was not vetted to the same degree it would be today.\r\n\r\n> If the PowerShell group insist on supporting Microsoft Word, then fine thats their business. But its just making it more difficult on them, as the code is more complex, and more prone to error. For example without that code you linked, the issue I posted here would never exist.\r\n\r\nNot gonna weigh in on if it was or wasn't a good idea, but the ship has sailed on that.  Too much code relies on it now unfortunately, I've seen *a lot* of scripts that would break.\r\n\r\n",
