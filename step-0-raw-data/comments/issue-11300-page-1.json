    "body": "Thanks @rjmholt for opening this. I feel this is a long over due feature to make PSD files a first class citizen in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nTo have full coverage there should also be a `Export-PowerShellDataFile` to go along with `Import`. The command names you have don't match the existing noun `PowerShellDataFile`. Personally, I have never liked `PowerShellDataFile` and preferred something like `PSData`, since most commands use `PS` abbreviation. What ever is chosen as the noun should be consistent between all commands. To change the noun on `Import-PowerShellDataFile` an alias can be used for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n@jaykul has done some work in this area with his [Configuration](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Configuration) module.\r\n\r\nI am unable to reach your prototype. Is it a private repository?",

It just depends on what people need and want. My small prototype is just very simple, and so far I don't think it parses, just serialises.\r\n\r\nMy ideal would be to have a subset of functionality that works without a PowerShell engine so it could be embedded as its own library if needed. Bear in mind that the more features and more PowerShell integration we do, the less efficient the serialisation gets. That's probably not a concern in most cases, especially since the PSD format isn't going to be used for protocols or very large files, but just want to mention it. In such a case, we could then override or augment the behaviour in PowerShell.",

Then I started to do some experiments with porting PSConfiguration (powershell.config.json) to the new API. I still have no conclusion how make this in better way but prototype works.\r\nIn #10898 Dongbo changed internals for types.ps1xml. It made a performance better. If we switched to JSON I guess we could get great performance in startup scenario and runspace creation scenario. The same is true for formats.ps1xml.\r\nNotice, that switching to JSON formats makes UX better. Many modern applications use files in the format. And many tools. And with good compatibility and interability.\r\nI think we should not put it off, we need to work on it now. Moreover, Core team is still working on the development of System.Text.Json API in 5.0 milestone and we could request feature we need.\r\n",

Core MSFT team already announced that many MSFT product group will migrate to .Net Core 3.1 in next year. I guess community project too. It will not be a surprise to me if we see an increase in the number of uses of PowerShell Core on Windows 10 or 100 times.\r\n\r\n15 year ago XML was a dominant format.

    "body": "Just to comment on the JSON/PSD debate... PSD is inherently a more 'capable' data format. It supports more types, comments*, (imo) has more clear boundaries between sections and data, and can be/is easily restricted with the AST. \r\n\r\n\\* I understand JSONC exists, but it isn't consistently enforced like PSD comments are. \r\n\r\nPersonally, PSD is more readable, and its syntax is already supported well in existing PowerShell tooling. \r\n\r\nI think instead of trying to hamfist JSON into the supported config format, we support the first-class PowerShell data file that exists? We can work on improving the interop between JSON and PSD with new or existing cmdlets.",

    "body": "Partially in response to @endowdly but mostly because it's not in this thread yet, the big issue with PSD is that parsing it is coupled to PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThis means:\r\n\r\n- There's no lightweight parser for it anywhere; you need full PowerShell to parse it\r\n- Writing one would mean a competing parser that may disagree with the existing parser (but there's no standard to say who is right)\r\n- The PowerShell parser (in particular the tokeniser) has undergone changes over the years, so there are already several competing parsers, some of which are mutually exclusive (PS 3 vs 4 vs 5.1)\r\n\r\nHowever, in truth this issue isn't to discuss the relative merits of PSD as a format. Quite the opposite; it should be as easy as possible to manipulate PSD so that you can freely convert from or to it as you prefer. If you like PSD, this proposal is good because it becomes easier to convert to PSD. If you prefer JSON, this proposal is good because it's now easier to convert away from PSD to JSON...",
