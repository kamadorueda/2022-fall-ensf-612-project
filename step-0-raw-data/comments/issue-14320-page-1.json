Original code defines `PSObject psobj` and _not return it_ - looks like dead code. But if I remove it tests fail which means that the original code still implicitly returns PSObject! \r\n\r\nUpdate: looks like a tricky bug in .Net Runtime. :-(\r\n",

If this will be implemented in any way we will fall in a breaking change so we can close the PR and add more in our documentation about PowerShell SemanticVersion class.",

Modern live cycle development model assumes preview versions is stable enough and works as well as release. Users actively use Preview versions. I believe they shouldn't disappoint users and behave as well as releases.\r\nIt also allows us to get reliable performance feedback early on, rather than after the final release.\r\n2. In SemanticVersion context `PSSemVerPreReleaseLabel` is null for stable version but `PSSemVerBuildLabel` could be not null - ex.: if we re-packaged we could increase the build label as SemVer standard says.\r\n",
