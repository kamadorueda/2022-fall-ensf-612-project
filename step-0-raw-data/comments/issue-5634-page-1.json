I don't know what is involved in adding a port to MacPorts, however if PowerShell were added to MacPorts, it is trivial to specify these libraries as dependancies and have MacPorts handle installing them (and keeping them up to date)\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, someone downloads the installer .pkg from GitHub, it would be good if it had all dependencies packaged with it, although I appreciate that you are then pulling in two third-party packages and will be responsible for keeping them up-to-date.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, MacPorts makes it very easy to build a .pkg installer for any of it's packages - e.g:\r\n```\r\nsudo port pkg openssl\r\n```\r\nThis will build an installer pkg for OpenSSL, however AFAIK these packages sometimes are limited to being installed on the same major version of the OS (e.g. if you build on 10.13 some packages may not work on 10.12)\r\n",

    "body": "We need to ensure that PowerShell has no hardcoded dynamic library paths. This is bad practice, leads to fragile configurations and can easily break with minor updates.\r\n\r\nFor example, macOS ships with OpenSSL libraries straight out of the box. Requiring the end user to install Homebrew specifically to have yet another OpenSSL library is problematic for a couple of reasons. One is that it requires the installation of more software than is strictly required. Two is that there is then another version of the OpenSSL library that needs to be kept up-to-date (or not, as the case may be if it breaks PowerShell) and can introduce security vulnerabilities if it's out of date.\r\n\r\nOn my install of macOS Catalina 10.15.3 I have the following SSL libraries in /usr/lib\r\n```\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  1482592 24 Jan 00:58 libboringssl.dylib\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   212288 24 Jan 00:59 libssl.0.9.7.dylib\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   335888 24 Jan 00:59 libssl.0.9.8.dylib\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   330592 24 Jan 00:58 libssl.35.dylib\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   314032 24 Jan 00:58 libssl.43.dylib\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   300512 24 Jan 00:59 libssl.44.dylib\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   294048 24 Jan 00:58 libssl.46.dylib\r\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel    32976 24 Jan 00:58 libssl.dylib\r\n```\r\nCan PowerShell simply use libraries that are already installed in macOS and only if Apple doesn't provide a suitable library, then fall back to requiring a third-party version?",
