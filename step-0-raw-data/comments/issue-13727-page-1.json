    "body": "> As for what could break, @SeeminglyScience: It's an exotic scenario to begin with, but given that there seems to be built-in magic to distinguish between a `[psobject]` and a `[pscustomobject]` cast (even though _both_ accelerators refer to `System.Management.Automation.PSObject`), one would certainly hope that someone who did that used `[psobject]`, not `[pscustomobject]`, for conceptual clarity alone.\r\n\r\nYeah I agree.  The chances that someone knows enough to know that wrapping in pso's is a thing, has a use case for doing it explicitly, and *still* uses `PSCustomObject` instead of `psobject`, are *incredibly* slim.",
