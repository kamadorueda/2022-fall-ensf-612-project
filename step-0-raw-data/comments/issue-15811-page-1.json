    "body": "Engine WG discussed this today. Our opinion is that there should be little harm in updating the type inference we currently have for `List<T>` to instead look for `IList<T>` when looking at inferencing the type for an indexed list. Doing so should retain the existing behaviour while also widening the potential capabilities of the type inference logic to encompass cases like this as well as any case where an object implements IList<T> and we're trying to infer the type of the elements.",
