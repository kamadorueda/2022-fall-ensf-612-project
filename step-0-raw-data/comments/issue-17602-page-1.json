    "body": "Yep. The `.CopyTo()` and `.MoveTo()` methods originate from the .NET objects. PowerShell has a separate concept of \"current directory\" to .NET, mainly because PowerShell's current directory can differ on a per-thread (per-Runspace) basis, so there can be multiple \"current directories\" in use by a single PowerShell instance.\r\n\r\n.NET's methods do not really allow PowerShell to inject its current runspace directory into the process-wide current directory in a way that can avoid race conditions (in other words, the behaviour would be unpredictable at best if PowerShell tried to do this). Additionally, PowerShell's provider subsystem can mean the \"current directory\" is not even on the filesystem at all, and so would be useless for .NET methods that expect to be working with a filesystem path.\r\n\r\nAs a result, whenever calling .NET methods (even on objects received from a PowerShell cmdlet) you need to fully qualify or resolve any paths you're using first. You can use `Resolve-Path` to do this before passing the path to the .NET method, or if you're working at the command line, you can usually tab-complete paths to expand them to their fully qualified representation.\r\n\r\nThis is a design limitation of the way PowerShell is built, as far as I know.",
