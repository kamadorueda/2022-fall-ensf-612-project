I wonder if it's possible that we can change the .csproj somehow to make `dotnet pack` produce a single NuGet package that contains both win and unix assemblies. #3417 is tracking it.\r\n\r\nIs changing to \"Platform\" a possible direction? Do you have some resources on the differences between \"Configuration\" and \"Project\" in the new MSBuild from .NET Core SDK?",

    "body": "I never build PowerShell in Visual Studio. We have automation for that. ;)\r\n\r\nI do the following whenever I want to work in PowerShell code:\r\n\r\n1. Open PowerShell.exe (or pwsh if you like -- I've just always done this part from PowerShell.exe).\r\n1. Browse into the root of your local PowerShell repository git clone.\r\n1. `git remote add upstream https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell` (if you haven't already done this).\r\n1. If I'm in a clean state with no local uncommitted changes:\r\n    1.  `git checkout master` (switch to the master branch)\r\n    1. `git pull upstream master` (get the latest PowerShell repo changes)\r\n    1. `git push origin master` (push those changes into my fork)\r\n1. If I'm about to work on a new changeset:\r\n    1. `git checkout -B my-branch-name` (where `my-branch-name` is the name of the branch I am about to start working on, using an appropriate name -- e.g. `splat-members` for a branch where I add support for splatting members of object instances)\r\n1. If I'm about to continue working on an existing changeset:\r\n    1. `git checkout my-branch-name` (switch to my changeset branch)\r\n    1. `git merge master` (catch my branch up to master)\r\n1. `ipmo ./build.psm1`\r\n1. `Start-PSBootstrap` (I only do this the first time ever on a system, and then periodically if I need to update .NET 3.x or something -- a failed build will give you a hint when this is necessary).\r\n1. `Start-PSBuild` (with `-Clean` if I want a clean rebuild, with `-ResGen` if I want to regenerate resource string DLLs -- when and how I use these depends on which branch I'm switching from/to).\r\n\r\nOnce I've got a build complete, I'll invoke it using `pwsh-debug`, which is an alias that gets defined from this script in my profile that needs to be periodically updated when the .NET version changes:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n#region Define pwsh-debug, and pwsh-release aliases.\r\n\r\n$pwshClone = \"${env:USERPROFILE}/source/repos/PowerShell\"\r\nif (Test-Path -LiteralPath $pwshClone) {\r\n    foreach ($buildName in @('debug','release')) {\r\n        $buildExe = \"${pwshClone}/src/powershell-win-core/bin/${buildName}/netcoreapp3.1/win7-x64/publish/pwsh.exe\"\r\n        if (Test-Path -LiteralPath $buildExe) {\r\n            if ($Host.Name -eq 'Windows PowerShell ISE Host') {\r\n                $executionContext.SessionState.PSVariable.set(\"pwsh-${buildName}\", $buildExe)\r\n                Set-Content \"function:pwsh-${buildName}\" @\"\r\nStart-Process '$buildExe'\r\n\"@\r\n            } else {\r\n                New-Alias -Name pwsh-${buildName} -Value \"$buildExe\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n#endregion\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou need to prime the pump for that to be in your profile, because if you've never built PowerShell before, you won't have the alias created, so you would need to manually dot source your profile after build to get the alias. You could alternatively use `Start-DevPowerShell` (that's part of the build module), but I never use that myself, preferring to work from a single console window.\r\n\r\nAt that point, I'll open PowerShell.sln in Visual Studio if I don't have it open already (if you use `Start-PSBuild -Clean`, you'll need to close VS first to release some file locks), invoke `$PID` in my PowerShell window to get the process ID, and then use Debug | Attach to Process in Visual Studio to attach to that process and start debugging.\r\n\r\nSome folks will prefer just working in Visual Studio, but given how much PowerShell is about automation/command line, I find this process suits my needs perfectly.",

    "body": "Thanks so much for your details. Very helpful and constructive information! Will try over the WE.\r\n\r\nI really would prefer to work on PowerShell code just like I work on *any other* software. Building is no big deal in VS (a matter of a click), so I wouldn't really consider this a need for automation, rather something that in VS is typically absolutely transparent to me, and with the powershell sources suddenly turns into a series of crucial steps to consider ;-)\r\n\r\nMy problem starts that when I open the sln in VS2019 OOB, it won't load a thing, and I have no clue why. I can't open any source.\r\n\r\nI'll dig through your checklist and am very grateful for it, probably things will resolve with your help. \r\n\r\nUltimately, though, I would expect powershell.sln to open and run *without any tricks and workarounds* in MSFT's premier dev environment VS. \r\n\r\nI might reconsider once I get the tool chain working that you describe. Meanwhile, I believe the more 'extra considerations' and 'rerequisite settings' are required to simply compile the project, the worse it is. It should be a friendly and easy first encounter, and \"just work\" for anyone used to program and compile software in VS.\r\n",

I do know of quite a few Windows devs who really struggled with the way how powershell is built/how it cannot be built from VS.

It can load the project but the project cannot be loaded? What are you trying to say?\r\n\r\n>I imagine once I wrap my head around the build process as you and most of the team got used to, I might find it equally appealing.\r\n\r\nWell, I'm not on the team, but \"the process\" [as described](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/building/windows-core.md) is literally a few powershell commands. I personally had not trouble following them. I do not find the process \"appealing\" I found it normal, documented and working.\r\n\r\n>Most professional devs (coming from the Windows side) use VS and their personal set of dev tools, so to welcome them, IMHO it is important to either provide a seamless dev experience using VS2019 OOB, or provide sufficient up-to-date information for new devs to quickly find their way into the build process.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about that. If a dev needs to be baby-sitted into making their dev enviroment comfortable for them, I would question how valueable their contribution might be. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against a proper VS2019 build process that is documented. It's just if the dev team does not _need_ it, it is quite understandable why this is not a priority, this is only natural.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth: once you've build the solution with the documented Build.psm1 way, you can open the solution in Visual Studion 2019 and it loads without any problems at all, if you have the correct SDK installed. If you do not, it tells you so. After that the solution does build in VS. It does not do _everything_ that Build.psm1 does but it builds. You can set a break point and debug. You can make a code change and iterate. I found it quite straightforward.\r\n\r\nThank you for your desire to document what you've leared from Staffan, and good luck with that.",

Still not a big issue unless you have to modify code in this area, but we should fix the project loading error. Apart from that I am happy with the level of VS support, even if it is not first class, we could do a better job at documentating what is supported in VS and what is not and known issues like the local changes in the sln file due to the way the projects are setup...\r\nI will try to see what the current behaviour with the VS preview (because we are on the .net core 3.1 preview now) and if I can fix it, it might even be a problem in VS or .net core where a certain element is not supported.",
