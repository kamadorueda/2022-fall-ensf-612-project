    "body": "@steviecoaster seems like a good enhancement.  To add new features to PSCore6, you should create a RFC in [PowerShell-RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC) repo which allows the community to provide feedback before spending time coding and the adjusting/fixing later based on feedback.  Since you've already written the code, perhaps we can expedite this by having a discussion in this issue on the cmdlet parameters and you can contribute the code as an [Experimental Feature](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/blob/release-62/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md) which would allow users to try it out and provide design feedback before it's committed and becomes breaking changes.",

    "body": "A couple of comments:\r\n- Not sure if this is a good thing or not.  cmdlets are nice and all, but having the full power of .NET with a simple method call (okay, it takes two method calls), makes this particular function seem overkill for C#, except maybe for handling io.streams.  Calling cmdlets take time and resources, directly calling the methods is much faster and uses fewer resources.\r\n\r\nCase in point.  This line quickly decodes, alters, and then re-encodes and formats the string back to original, and it processes multi megabyte files in a blink of an eye.  (this manipulates a text file that has been encoded within a `<data>` element inside a .NET RESX file, returning it to the RESX file in an altered state.) https://github.com/msftrncs/PwshIFMResXTools/blob/master/IFM%20MPC%20RESX%20Reducer.ps1#L102-L108\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$datablock.value = ([Convert]::ToBase64String([Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes(\r\n            # convert from Base64String\r\n            [Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String($datablock.value)\r\n                # remove effectively empty S3, S2, or S1 DATA records\r\n            ) -replace 'S(?:(?:3.{4})|(?:2..)|(?:1)).{6}(?:FF)+..\\r*\\n')\r\n        # take the new Base64String and break it into 80 character lines formatted as assumed for the RESX file\r\n    ) -replace '.{1,80}', \"`n        `$&\") + \"`n\"\r\n```\r\n- On the other hand, wouldn't the PowerShell Gallery be an ideal place to showcase something like this?\r\n- Would there not be some use in providing other parameters from the .NET functions, such as the start character and length of characters, formatting options, or even the ability to input/output `char[]` (`Base64CharArray()`)?\r\n- The other possibility I have seen used is to create custom types to alias these method calls, so again, a cmdlet may be overkill.  See https://tfl09.blogspot.com/2013/02/working-with-base64-strings-in.html.  (this is an example of adding a custom method to the `string` type to handle both encoding (fixed to Unicode) and conversion in a single virtual method.)  I could see this being improved to add additional methods to `byte[]` for the encoding, and that would make both functions more simple to use.  `$newString = $origString.toUTF8ByteArray().toBase64String()`, `$decoded = $encoded.ConvertFromBase64().toUTF8DecodedString()`\r\n",
