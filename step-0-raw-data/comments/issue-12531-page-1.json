    "body": "I have an implementation of Get-StringHash that is used by many of our internal powershell modules.  For a built-in implementation to be useful in our organization it would need to implement the whole matrix of a significant number of common input (strings, byte arrays, etc), algorithms (CRC, MD5, SHA256, etc) and output formats (hex, base64, ascii, etc).  \r\n\r\nFor most of our use cases we need the property `($s1 | Get-StringHash) -eq ( $s2 | Get-StringHash)` to hold for all cases where `$s1` and `$s2` are the \"same\".  I suspect that is the property needed by many users looking to convert a string to a hash.  I have found a significant number of edge cases related to text encoding, EOLs, etc on both the input and output side that prevent that property from holding across PowerShell, .NET, and OS versions and editions.  Our organization tests for that property across the subset of combinations for which we need the property to hold and make changes to our implementation to correct for edge cases.  Doing that for all possible conditions seems like a substantial undertaking.  \r\n\r\nI don't think the sort of testing to make that property hold is occurring for other PowerShell commands currently; there are combinations of PowerShell versions where `Set-Content` and `Get-Content` roundtrips aren't isomorphic, for example.  So if you write a string to a file with PowerShell 5 and read it with PowerShell 7 you can end up with significant observable differences some of which break equality.  It's not obvious that there is a conversion that completely corrects for the differences.  `Get-StringHash` would add another layer to that problem.",
