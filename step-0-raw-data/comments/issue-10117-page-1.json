My point was that if you're setting a breakpoint that is already set _the exact same way as an existing breakpoint_ (same line/column/command/variable/script/action), then that should just give you back the breakpoint that is already set. When working from the command line using PSReadline's `Ctrl+R` or just up arrow to `Set-PSBreakpoint` commands between sessions, it's easy to set a single breakpoint twice the exact same way. That's what I want to prevent.",
