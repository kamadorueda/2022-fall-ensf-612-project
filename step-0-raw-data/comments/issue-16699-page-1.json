    "body": "What you are asking is pretty vague and broad.\r\n- If you intend to handle the user input in a customized way, you can implement the `PSConsoleHostReadLine` function, which is a hook in PowerShell console host for implementing custom read-line functionality. `PSReadLine` leverages it to provide a rich read-line experience, so you can absolutely do something similar.\r\n- If you intend to do things based on user keystrokes, then take a look at `Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler` from `PSReadLine`, which allows you to map keybindings to actions.\r\n- If you want to implement completion for native commands, try `Register-ArgumentCompleter`. It has an example using `dotnet`, which you can find [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-argumentcompleter?view=powershell-7.2#example-3--register-a-custom-native-argument-completer).",
