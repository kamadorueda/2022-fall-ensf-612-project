    "body": "Sorry for leaving this PR unattended for such a long time ... The conflicts were resolved.\r\n\r\nThe changes in `PowerShell.Common.props` is pretty clean and well organized. The comments are good and very helpful -- some minor touch-ups can be made but we can do that when we finalize the changes. I have a few concerns here about the change:\r\n1. We need to be able to produce a release build without actually pushing the release tag. For example, we need to build for `v6.0.0-beta.6` without pushing the git tag `v6.0.0-beta.6`. This is needed because pushing a release tag should be the last step for a release so that any issues we discovered during the preparation of the release can still be fixed before having the release tag pushed. Currently, this is achieved by passing `-ReleaseTag` to `Start-PSBuild` and `Start-PSPackage`. Take `Start-PSBuild` for an instance, when `-ReleaseTag` is specified, it will use that as the release tag instead of turning to `git describe`. Is it possible to continue allowing this with the `GetPSCoreVersionFromGit` target? (maybe by passing the to-be-used tag name to a property and in case that property is not empty, use that instead of running `git describe`)\r\n\r\n1. The target `GetPSCoreVersionFromGit` seems to be executed for multiple times (once per `csproj`). Can we make it run only once?\r\n\r\n1. When the target runs `git`, the output shows on console (see the screenshot below). Is it possible to suppress it while still capturing the output in `Exec` tasks?\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/29479607-18df85e2-8428-11e7-9f68-f3d9ceda722e.png)\r\n",

I guess it is \"by design\" - MSBuild create new context for every csproj and re-run targets. I'll be happy if I'm wrong.
