    "body": "Windows PowerShell used .Net's JSON serializer.  Since that is not in coreFx, for PowerShell Core, we use Newtonsoft.Json which handles thing differently.  In the case of datetime, looking at the Newtonsoft code, they always convert to localtime although they can preserve the UTC.  However, they follow ISO 8601 datetime format which supports both a colon and no colon for the offset, but Newtonsoft decided to [always add the colon](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/blob/aa5f28c09732db5fb3e316433547ea7cdecd8804/Src/Newtonsoft.Json/Utilities/DateTimeUtils.cs#L757).  I would suggest creating an issue in their repo to support a new DateTimeZoneHandling value so that at least the colon isn't inserted and then we can expose a parameter to support that.",

    "body": "My 2￠- I found about this change when I've tried to write a unit test for a JSON file. I wanted to check if property containing time conforms to specific format (ISO 8601/RFC 3339). I was using `[datetime]::TryParseExact` and couldn't figure out why it fails until I looked into the debugger and saw that the property was converted to `[dateime]` instead of being a plain string.\r\n\r\nI get how this could benefit round trip scenarios, but I wish that `ConvertFrom-Json` had an option to disable this behavior. Perhaps a `-Raw` switch?",
