And thanks for showing the (incomplete?) code in a work-in-progress pull request.\r\n\r\n> If there is already a `\\` in front of the `\"` no change is made.\r\n\r\nI think this is a very dangerous half-hearted measure. I'd honestly prefer to not change the current behavior, than to further modify the \"guess what the user wanted and try to do something maybe that could be right\" method.\r\n\r\nImplementing it this way would still not allow to pass arbitrary sting contents to executables. But instead of knowing that I have to correctly escape `\"`-chars, I would than have to write an even more complex regex replace construct to do the right thing.    \r\n*&lt;Edit>* I thought about it, the regex doesn't get more complicated, just different. *&lt;/Edit>*\r\n\r\nThis would mean changing from one inconsistent behavior to another more complicated inconsistent behavior...\r\n\r\nAnother disadvantage: The current behavior is at least relatively obvious. It is at least somewhat likely that a user would test if a string containing a quote is passed correctly. The proposed behavior would would mean, that people would only notice the problem if they explicitly test if a backslash followed by a quote is passed correctly...\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nNote: The correct way to escape *N* backslashes followed by `\"` is *2N+1* backslashes followed by `\"`. (`\\\"`→`\\\\\\\"`, `\\\\\"`→`\\\\\\\\\\\"`,...)",

This way these arguments are still fully compatible to the common rules. Yes, msiexec, etc. won't accept embedded literal quotes this way, but I'd say that's not a terribly common use case and therefore not really powershells problem.

    "body": "Thanks, @TSlivede - **I don't think there's any  disagreement in substance here**.\r\n\r\nI am _not_ advocating for a hard-coded list of \"rogue\" CLIs (I had considered that earlier, but decided against it), I am indeed recommending that _any_ verbatim argument seen by PowerShell _on Windows_ that looks like `foo=bar baz` or `/foo:bar baz` / `-foo:bar baz` be passed to an external executable as `foo=\"bar baz\"` or `/foo:\"bar baz\"` / `-foo:\"bar baz\"` on the process command line.\r\n\r\nOf course, this _is_ an accommodation, but a highly beneficial one.\r\n\r\nAs for the other, closely related accommodation I proposed, namely to switch to `\"\"`-escaping in the presence of such arguments:\r\n\r\nThat `CommandLineToArgvW` doesn't support `\"\"` is a good reason _not_ to do that, so I agree with you that we should not attempt this, which means that `msiexec` / `msdeploy` calls with _embedded_ `\"` chars. (e.g., \r\n`msiexec ... PROP='bar \"n\" baz'`) will fail, unless they use `--%`, as you state - to be documented in `about_Native_Calls`.\r\n\r\n> But such a `echoArgs.exe` would be much less useful if not all .exe files are treated the same.\r\n\r\nGiven the above, the only scenarios in which `echoArgs.exe` then wouldn't tell you the truth is when you call _batch files_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we either need a separate `echoArgs.cmd` or `dbea`, whose `-UseBatchFile` switch uses a batch-file behind the scenes.\r\n",
