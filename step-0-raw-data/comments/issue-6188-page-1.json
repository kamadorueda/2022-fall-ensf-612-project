    "body": "The issue is that _if a given cmdlet's module happens not to be imported at the time you run your command_, its `.HelpUri`, as reported by `Get-Command`, erroneously returns `''` (the empty string).\r\n\r\nYou can verify this by directly invoking a cmdlet in question - which implicitly forces importing of its module - and then running your command again:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nConvertFrom-SecureString -?  # forces import of underlying module 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Security'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, re-running your command should eliminate all cmdlets from module `Microsoft.PowerShell.Security` from your list (meaning that their `.HelpUri` property now contains the expected value), which in your case should only leave:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nRemove-Alias       # from module Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\r\nStart-Transcript   # from module Microsoft.PowerShell.Host\r\nStop-Transcript    # ditto\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you agree with this diagnosis, please update the issue's title and original post accordingly.",
