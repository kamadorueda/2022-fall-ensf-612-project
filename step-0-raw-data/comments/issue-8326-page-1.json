    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT After thinking about this change, I think that the original issue leads us away. It comes from that we must take care of escape sequences. But why should we do this if we have not done it before? I think this is a misconception that comes from the fact that Microsoft now invests a lot in ConTTY. I believe that this investments is aimed, among other things, at ensuring compatibility with Unix vty and _existing_ software. And this does not mean that modern software should work according to protocols of 40 years old. \r\nI guess this is a wrong design.\r\nIf we fill our scripts with these escape sequences, what will we do with them if we will work with other consoles like Web? Now we are condemning ourselves to the development of additional intermediate non-standard adapters. But if we are forced to create adapters for different terminals, then it is better to do this through the standard abstract API, which will eliminate the intermediate layers, which are the source of numerous superimposed errors. And current Issue and PR clearly show this.\r\nIn fact, we already have this api. It allows us to colored output both to a Windows console and to an Unix console. We should only improve this api. \r\nThis also means that we must treat escape sequences literally. If we need something like that for formatting, then we should use PowerShell standard language features which will work _everywhere_ (with any console). We already have interpolated strings and we could enhance them to support output formatting.\r\nSuch design would allow PowerShell Core to cling to any console with minimal code addition without the imposition of transforming layers.\r\nI think your team should discuss this thoroughly.",

If the output should be based on VT100, then we definitely need to accept this as an RFC. And this is definitely a fundamental decision and fundamental change.\r\n\r\nI consider VT100 as a low-level assembler. It is not user-friendly.  Nobody uses Intel assembler - developers prefer absractions of high level languages. Why? Because they need to accomplish their goal quickly and simply. I’m sure that PowerShell should also provide sufficient abstractions so that users _don’t think_ about VT100 escape sequences. PowerShell style is using ` Write-Host -BackgroundColor Blue` but not using `Write-Host 0x1A ...`. _We should consider VT100 as one of the options for implementing high-level abstractions._\r\nWe should not lower to the lower level in the PowerShell language itself. The use of abstractions allows us to be comfortable, fast and reliable with any consoles. As PowerShell engine developer we are free to use vty or Windows console api (why we'd need reject the api if it allows us to make great-look a progress bar? and it is more multi-thread friendly). We can switch free to ncurses or Web (not only HTML, we can use any api over https!). At the same time, users should use simple and powerful abstractions to easily write scripts that work on any platform and with any terminal.\r\nAnother thing that worries me is that with the allowing of escapes, we bind to the vty but will not we format the table cells on the Web? The right design would be to delegate this to the conhost implementation. Escapes is and should be implementation details. So I am sure that these escapes are not what should be in PowerShell _language_.\r\n",

And this does not mean that modern software should work according to protocols of 40 years old.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you're only half right on this point. We invested in ConPTY as a way of ensuring compatibility with existing _Windows_ software. We realized early on in Windows 10 that _everybody_ standardized on VT, and doubled down on supporting it.\r\n\r\nConPTY is an attempt to:\r\n* allow Windows applications to host Windows consoles, but exchange VT (and therefore be \"terminal emulators\")\r\n* allow applications using the ~73 Windows Console APIs to be run and have the effects of those APIs translated _into_ VT.\r\n\r\nFor the issue at hand, it seems like table formatting should be entirely Host-driven. In the case of the console, only the console host knows how many cells each character takes up, which escape sequences should count against the table cell width (for colors, none; for cursor movement, who knows?), and how to properly terminate a dangling sequence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, that may not be how PowerShell was designed.",

    "body": "@DHowett-MSFT Thanks for feedback! All you are talking about is _a low level_ of work with a console. This is a standard because we can hardly think of something simpler for this low level. The issue is about _high level_ - why we are starting to expose the low level to PowerShell language level and user level: (1) why PowerShell users should thinking about escapes and use its? why the users should remember the escapes? (2) Do we know high level languages which explicitly exposes the escapes to users rejecting absractions?\r\n\r\n> Unfortunately, that may not be how PowerShell was designed.\r\n\r\nPowerShell is designed to expose users high level and magic things. Low level should stay on low level. In the case _an implementing of rendering_ is the low level, high level is PowerShell language abstractions (like `Write-Host -BackgroundColor Blue` and perhaps interpalated strings as I metioned above).\r\nCurrently PowerShell conhost class has already needed abstractions to works (1) on windows (buffered console API), (2)  on Unix (vty). So my thoughts is (1) use/enhance PowerShell conhost class abstractions, (2) move rendering implementations to console adapters.\r\n\r\nI assume that this problem comes from the fact that PowerShell mainly works with a simple console. In fact, it should work with any console and any remote protocol (as I mentioned above).\r\n",
