Existing code doing that strikes me as not too likely.\r\n\r\n@spaghettidba brings up a good point, but it is outweighed by the long tradition of ignoring other languages and keyboard layouts in computing :) (e.g., `\\`, `@`)\r\n\r\n@iSazonov: It's quite likely that `##` is used in existing code for comments, and even if you limited recognition to `##<newline>` sequences, the potential for confusion with a comment is great.\r\n\r\n[Tangent alert]\r\n\r\n@LarryWeiss: Re line continuation in other languages (to add to @rkeithhill's comment):\r\n\r\nGood point; to elaborate on the fundamental difference between POSIX-compatible shells such as Bash and PowerShell with respect to line continuation:\r\n\r\n* In Bash, `\\<newline>` is _removed_ from the lines of a command  / inside a double-quoted string; this allows splitting command lines at arbitrary points and composing single-line strings spread across several lines inside double quotes.\r\n\r\n* In PowerShell, `` `<newline> `` _preserves_ the newline; this requires splitting to occur _between_ arguments and makes use inside a (double-quoted) _string_ pointless, because a `<newline>` by itself will do; to get line continuation with a string in a POSIX sense, you must use the workaround of an _array_ of substrings with unary `-join`.\r\n\r\nNote that in both environments there is _no_ line continuation in _single_-quoted strings, where all content is treated _literally_ (with the exception of `''` in PS) - so, strictly speaking, your example doesn't apply (inside `'...'`, both the `` ` `` and the `<newline>` are retained, and, as with double-quoted strings, just `<newline>` will do).\r\n",
