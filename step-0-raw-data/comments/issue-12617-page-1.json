I guess there should be a reason for it looking strange like that...\r\n\r\nSo in PSv2, the `AliasAttribute` was decorated with `AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property | AttributeTargets.Field)` so it wasn't yet able to be applied to classes.  In PSv3 (I think), `AttributeTargets.Class` was added.  Although the CIM cmdlets were added in the same version, my **guess** is that the additional attribute target was added later in development (or the folks working on CIM just weren't aware of it). If y'all found someone who remembers then feel free to ignore my theory 🙂 \r\n\r\n",
