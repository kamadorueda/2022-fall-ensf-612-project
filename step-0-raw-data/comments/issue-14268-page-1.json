    "body": "Question from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6443:\r\n\r\n> Dear fellows, I am tired that PS 5.1 currently installed on my Windows 7 x64 (please, don’t even mention W10) is unable to  properly execute BOM-less *.ps1 with UTF8 strings (e.g. `$singer = \"Björk\"; echo $singer` outputs as BjГ¶rk). That's why I downloaded both (portable) PS 6.2.7 and 7.2.0p7 and run as follows `pwsh.exe .\\test.ps1`. Indeed, they have no problem outputting UTF8, but the execution time is 2x slower: 320ms (5) vs 694ms (7) vs 760ms (6). Delay is noticeable and annoying.  …[There was a trick][1] to make early PS run faster by `ngen install`. Is there something similar here, or we're doomed?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://superuser.com/questions/627077/windows-powershell-is-taking-long-time-to-start-the-first-time-after-windows-log?noredirect=1&lq=1",
