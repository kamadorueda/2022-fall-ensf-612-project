I think Jeffrey even filed an issue before alpha went public. \r\n\r\nI'm totally okay with this as a breaking change. Anyone with an advanced enough scenario to take a dependency on the path of the XML, they can figure out what's happening. To be honest, it's most likely to break our own tests in PowerShell-Docs than anything else. \r\n\r\nI think we should throw a warning for a version or two though. I know that we usually say warnings are useless for non interactive scenarios because they're headless, but I think we're getting used more and more in CI and orchestration scenarios where people can go review the console output afterwards. A yellow warning on Appveyor, e.g. would be very useful.",
