That assembly either contains links to the system libcurl or has that libcurl baked into it. I'm not sure what voodoo magic it is doing in that assembly. I'm not sure how you generate that assembly other than to obtain it through nuget. This part of the problem is out of my depth as I am very very unfamiliar with the dotent build process. We need someone who knows what they're doing in that knowledge area to take a look. \r\n\r\nre: #4029 I suspected that at first there was some macOS/libcurl/CoreFX issue at play, but I went digging into the code and was not sure it is even using libcurl for any of that.

    "body": "If I understand that PR correctly, previously they were directly using OpenSSL in the project for a bunch of operations and removed that. I don't think this changes anything regarding the issue at hand. You should still be able to plug in the `libcurl` of your choice as HttpClient is just wrapping it. If 'libcurl' is using OpenSSL then you get the supported features such as Certificate authentication and not-broken `HttpClientHandler.SslProtocols`. \r\n\r\nWhat is happening instead is that \"System.Net.Http.Native\" is only using the system provided libcurl. on 10.13.1 that is libcurl+LibreSSL, on 10.12.6 that is libcurl+SecureTransport. We have a step in the build process to install curl with openssl, but instead of it actually using that libcurl, it is favoring the system libcurl. \r\n\r\nThe brew formula says it all:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n==> Caveats\r\nThis formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,\r\nbecause macOS already provides this software and installing another version in\r\nparallel can cause all kinds of trouble.\r\n\r\nIf you need to have this software first in your PATH run:\r\n  echo 'export PATH=\"/usr/local/opt/curl/bin:$PATH\"' >> ~/.bash_profile\r\n\r\nFor compilers to find this software you may need to set:\r\n    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/curl/lib\r\n    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/curl/include\r\nFor pkg-config to find this software you may need to set:\r\n    PKG_CONFIG_PATH: /usr/local/opt/curl/lib/pkgconfig\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis at least explains why a change in the OS version by Travis CI would affect the web cmdlets tests: new OS version means a different libcurl version and possibly even a different crypto provider (in the case of 10.12-to-10.13).\r\n\r\nThat means that the features available and working are beholden to the underlying OS unless we have some way to specify or include the libcurl that is called to ensure it is the one installed from brew.",
