    "body": "Yeah, `-<number>` is interpreted by the parser as a negative number rather than a parameter name in this instance. \r\n\r\nThis isn't the only example; many parameter names can be used which are entirely unusable, especially when using `${variable}` syntax, which allows for many otherwise illegal characters to be used.\r\n\r\ne.g., \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction test { param([object] ${|UnusableParam}) Write-Output ${|UnusableParam} }\r\n#is interpreted as \"test -\" and then throws a CommandNotFoundException on UnusuableParam that follows the pipe.\r\ntest -|UnusableParam Value\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the best course of action is probably to create a PSSA rule that warns when such parameters are created, so users are aware ahead of time that they're making parameters that they won't be able to refer to.\r\n\r\nNote that you _can_ refer to them via splatting, so it's not entirely an \"illegal\" parameter per se, just one you can't call directly:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# using the above function as the example\r\n$params = @{ '|UnusableParam' = \"hello\" }\r\nPS> test @params\r\nhello\r\n\r\n# using the original issue function as the example\r\n$params = @{ '1' = $true }\r\nPS> p1 @params\r\nYes\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a general best-practice recommendation, I'd advise not doing that for several other reasons, chief amongst them being it isn't particularly great for readability. ðŸ˜„ ",

The PSSA rule is a good suggestion.  `Get-Help` is doing the right thing by just looking at the cmdlet signature so I don't think it's worth changing that.  The parameter binder could determine that the cmdlet doesn't accept any ints by position nor remaining args, so it could know that `-1` is a switch, but it seems such an edge case I'd rather not spend time trying to make changes to the parameter binder and introduce some other bug.",
