Simply navigating the filesystem is immensely subpar to a native Linux experience.\r\n\r\nIt is not just the the pathological large `~\\Downloads` folder that suffers from this, but most Windows `bin` folders (Cygwin, Git, Visual Studio, Qt, etc.) so any install that has a fair amount of `.exe` and `.dll` in it. It is fairly common for a sysadmin to list folders for files. On Linux, it's roughly as fast as the console can spew out characters.\r\n\r\nAnd I haven't even talked about `locate somehing` vs. `gci C:\\ -R -Fil something -Err SilentlyContinue`. Prior takes 1 second at most, while the latter is a multi-minute command. Powershell could really improve on its interactive part.",

I saw him training for that ride commuting to work - so he was actually part of how I got started unicycling.\r\n\r\nAs long as you brought it up - @LeeHolmes and @vors can also ride a unicycle - so it's highly recommended if you want to be one of the cool PowerShell peeps :)",
