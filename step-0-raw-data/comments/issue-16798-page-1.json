Arguably that's something that _could_ be exposed for runtime checks, tab completion, etc., if we wanted to.\r\n\r\nIt mightn't be entirely straightforward, but I think it's a worthwhile change to investigate.",

The hardest one to fix is issue 4 because the type completion cache is grouped into \"dots\" to make lookups faster. You could prepend each using statement to the wordToComplete and do multiple lookups but performance might take a hit so maybe it's better to find a different way to group them or maybe even avoid grouping them at all.",
