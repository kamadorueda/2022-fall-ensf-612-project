    "body": "@True-Demon @Jaykul did you never get into trouble with these workarounds in combination with dynamic parameters? Problem is `Get-Variable` gets any variable so in case of dynamic parameters it won't find their default because those parameters aren't available with their name in the scope, so instead it looks further so if there happens to be another, unrelated, variable with the same name in the scope it will use that. E.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$foo = 1\r\n\r\nfunction Bar {\r\ndynamicparam(\r\n  # Create \"foo\" dynamic here with default 2\r\n)\r\n# Oops, this returns 1, no matter what was passed.\r\nGet-Variable \"foo\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",
