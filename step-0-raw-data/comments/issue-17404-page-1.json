    "body": "In general changing the underlying type of an output object is considered a breaking change. Certainly there's a matter of greater or lesser degress (for example, both Hashtable and OrderedDictionary support similar basic IDictionary interfaces and so forth), but if anything happens to be relying on the specific type (e.g., using reflection APIs to do something with the hashtable, or just simply checking the output type for one reason or another) will break.\r\n\r\nConsider a relatively straightforward script that walks the resulting object from ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable which checks what to do with each node based on its type -- array, hashtable, something else. In that case, if the check is `if ($node -is [hashtable])` then such a script would break, despite OrderedDictionary being largely similar to a hashtable:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$root = $json | ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable\r\n\r\nforeach ($node in $root.GetEnumerator()) {\r\n    $name = $node.Name\r\n    $value = $node.Value\r\n    if ($value -is [array]) {\r\n        foreach ($item in $value) {\r\n            # do stuff with array items, probably recurse?\r\n        }\r\n        \r\n        continue\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    if ($value -is [hashtable]) {\r\n         # recurse and evaluate all the hashtable entries\r\n         continue\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    # do stuff with the remaining non-array and non-dictionary/hashtable items\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not against the change at all, but it's worth mentioning it is breaking and tagging it as such, because regardless of whether a large number of users are likely to be impacted, it needs to be documented as such so users know what to expect.\r\n\r\nConsider also whether it's worth confusing users over the actual type of the object. The switch is _named_ `-AsHashtable`, not `-AsOrderedDictionary`. Maybe a new switch is a better option here to avoid confusion and give users a choice?\r\n\r\nThere are, after all, additional performance impacts when using OrderedDictionary compared to using Hashtable.",

Anything written since `[ordered] `was added in V3 _should_ test for both, but I did a search through all the code on my laptop and found one thing I wrote in the last year and various modules which don't. One popular module had this  \r\n```\r\nif ($x -is [HashTable] -or $x.ToString() -eq 'System.Collections.Hashtable' ) {... \r\n```  \r\nNot sure about the benefit of the second part :-) \r\n \r\nBut that's also an argument for things to stick to outputting hash tables and _never_ to output ordered dictionary - if I publish something which outputs _ordered_ and someone uses it with a module with a test for `[hashtable]`. they will hit an error. \r\n\r\nThe problem with changing the default behaviour to ordered isn't (IMHO) code which says \r\n```\r\n$stuff =  Get-content $file | convertFrom-Json -asHashTable\r\nif ($stuff -is [hashtable]) \r\n``` \r\nBecause we don't generally do that,  it's someone calling \r\n``` \r\n$s = Get-Stuff  # which now converts to ordered\r\nInvoke-Something -options $s\r\n ```\r\nWhere `Invoke-Something` is 10 years old, not  being updated with an untyped options parameter and code which checks to see if $options is a hash table.  Changing the existing switch (or if the existing switch had been ordered from the start) would mean that everything using ConvertFrom-Json would break  But if there is a new switch for ordered output and I use it in `Get-Stuff` there's still a problem with my code working with `Invoke-Something`.  It narrows the scope, so it's probably the way to go, but it needs to come with a warning - only use this where the order matters because a few things out there will break.\r\n\r\n",
