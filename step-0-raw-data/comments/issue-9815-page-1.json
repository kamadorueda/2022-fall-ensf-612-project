It is not a cast.  This is not something that happens in the Net assemblies.  How PS decides that the string is \"coercible\" is not documented but it has always worked even beyond WinForms.  System,Drawing is not really part of WinForms but is fundamental to using WinForms.  System.Drawing is the graphical class assembly used to manipulate images as well as other drawing primitives.\r\n\r\nPowerShell has always been able to use WinForms assemblies.  The assemblies are also available in PS 7.\r\n\r\nSystem.Windows.Forms.dll and System.Drawing.DLL are delivered with PowerShell 7 and are in the preview folder.  WinForms and the WinForms designer are part of PowerShell 7.\r\n",

And that they should encourage repro steps without PowerShell when filing there.\r\n\r\nThe key reasons are:\r\n1. It eliminates the chance it is something specific to PowerShell. (Avoids specialties like custom binding, Framework targeting, etc.)\r\n2. It is more actionable as few (if any) devs in CoreFx know what PowerShell does under the hood and we have 0 knowledge about anything more complex/tricky/specific.\r\n\r\nNote: Same approach is used for other higher-level technologies and frameworks like ASP.NET, WPF, WinForms, WCF, 3rd party libraries, etc. If we get repro steps from those, we first ask higher-level frameworks to be eliminated. Only in worst hard-to-repro-and-track-down issues we jump into investigations that involve the higher-level frameworks (and only if those are impacting multiple customers).\r\n\r\nDoes it make sense?\r\nIs there any way we can help to spread the word about this in PowerShell repo community?\r\nThanks!",
