Fortunately this is actually handled fairly well in that whenever a script does not run due to Constrained Language mode we do actually throw a nice event in the PowerShell Operational Event log that specifically says a script was blocked due to Contrained Language mode.\r\n\r\n([source](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/kfalde/2017/01/20/pslockdownpolicy-and-powershell-constrained-language-mode/))\r\n\r\nHowever, during my testing I could not locate this event no matter how hard I was looking for it—even though there were plenty of other events in the PowerShell operations log. Hence, because _(a)_ this blog post is not authoritative by someone from PowerShell team and _(2)_ it does not provide any specific examples of said events, I assume either that was never the case, or it is not very robust and breaks under certain circumstances.",

A specific scenario would help.\r\n\r\nPlease see my original post with the specific scenario (OpsMgr agent.) However, because the issue is so old, I don't have a repro readily available anymore, and building one purposefully would be quite laborious.\r\n\r\nIn general, I do not think we should focus on a specific scenario here. Rather, we need to solve the class of problems as a whole. If _something_ gets blocked due to WDAC and/or Constrained language mode, and it happens behind the scenes (i.e. there's no interactive PowerShell window to look at), how do I know about that and know where the issue is?\r\n\r\nIn short, I believe we need the following information be logged _somewhere._\r\n\r\n1. The fact that something tried to execute.\r\n2. What it was. (Script/interactive command/etc.)\r\n3. Who tried to run it (e.g. parent process, user name, etc.)\r\n3. Did it succeed or failed to execute.\r\n4. The reason it failed (e.g. WDAC, or Constrained language mode, etc.)\r\n5. Which piece of code was subject to the restriction. (E.g. the specific line which violates Constrained language mode rules.)\r\n\r\nThe last bit is nice to have, and everything else should not contain any sensitive information whatsoever.\r\n\r\nToday, there's either no way to figure out any of the above, or it's utterly painful. (You have to dig through system-wide transcripts.) This makes it a bummer for users who try to implement good security. Some customers gave up WDAC because of this restriction.\r\n\r\n\r\n> it is not obvious where we could to see result of WDAC check. In AppLocker log?\r\n\r\nIt _may be_ AppLocker log, however there's a couple issues with it.\r\n\r\n1. As a user, I have no idea what this all have to do with AppLocker, and it's not documented anywhere. We know that WDAC uses AppLocker mechanisms under the hood, and that's why it sometimes emits info into AppLocker logs. However, assuming I'm not using AppLocker, I'm only using WDAC, and something mysteriously fails in PowerShell (or a separate app which just happens to execute PowerShell scripts behind the scenes), AppLocker log will be the last place on Earth where I would look for clues.\r\n2. AppLocker feature is not available on Server Core, and hence there's no AppLocker log whatsoever. Even though WDAC is present, and hence the whole scenario is entirely possible. (In fact, the customer I was dealing with when filing the original issue was facing this particular issue on Server Core—and there was no way to troubleshoot that.)",

    "body": "Thanks for taking your time to respond. Unfortuantely it all does not help much.\r\n\r\n> The PowerShell does give out an exit codes and feedback when there is exceptions called when you call powershell from execution. This should give you some insight as to what specifically is being ran however you have to run it directly from PowerShell and not through a cmd.exe. (There is an extension to execute PowerShell directly so this should not be a problem using SCOM).\r\n\r\nThis will only help if the calling application (OpsMgr in this case) is aware of such issues and can handle the specific exit codes. In reality, many apps do not. They are simply unaware of WDAC and/or Constrained language mode, and they assume that if script launched (and they have permissions, etc.) it will complete. Moreover, OpsMgr runs scripts in its own host, so the exit code might not even generate. Effectively, the discovery (or other monitoring operations) fail silently, and for the end user it simply looks like the service or component to be monitored is not there. No success, no failure, no discovered objects. End of the story.\r\n\r\nThere are other apps (e.g. Windows Admin Center) who fall more or less into the same trap. Yes, each app can (and probably should) be redesigned to become aware of WDAC and CLM. Who knows how many 3rd party apps are affected as well. Given that such redesign for each and every app is not happening in foreseeable future, I'm just suggesting that maybe we should try to address this _class of issues_ (even if partly) from PowerShell side.\r\n\r\n> There are a ton of forensic tooling via Eventlog that might help. With exception CLM (Not supported without transcription).\r\n\r\nYes, transcription is what I have to use today when troubleshooting such issues. My point is that it's painful, and I can only do this _because I know where to look_ and what to look for. For an average system admin this is a non-starter.\r\n\r\n> For Applocker/WDAC info\r\n<...>\r\nEvents 8029, 8038 etc\r\n\r\nYes, this is great. No kidding—this is fantastic. It's **exactly** what I'm looking for.\r\n\r\nExcept that AppLocker log is not present on Server Core. (Which is by desgin since AppLocker feature is not there.) That's why I'm asking for similar (or better) events to be logged on PowerShell side, to PowerShell logs. _This is the whole point of this very issue._\r\n\r\n> Now because WDAC sends telemetry to Azure, as long as you tie your WDAC environment to a Log Analytics Workspace, you can also query the data from WDAC for details as to what failed. It gives details like CLI/Executable calls (this should contain command line data)\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of people who do not or cannot connect to Azure, e.g. because they're running in air-gapped networks. I do not believe that “use Azure” is an adequate resolution, even if it might indeed help some customers.",
