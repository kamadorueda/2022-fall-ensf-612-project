    "body": "Whoops. Yeah, we need to fix this test. `if ($IsWindows) { ... | Should Be $env:homepath }`.\n\nHowever, we transparently map `HOMEPATH` to `HOME` on Linux, so we should just be able to use `HOMEPATH` (see [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-monad/blob/1d26807583f36a3e86d8c4f970173e6ffe747dbb/monad/src/CoreCLR/CorePsExtensions.cs#L846)). Looking at that code again, I realize we also need to do that switch match in a case insensitive manner, as PowerShell/Windows environment variables are not case sensitive (but Linux ones are).\n\n@JumpingYang001 Do you want to fix it?\n",
