    "body": "@vors Happy to have this issue renamed/repurposed - my apologies for hijacking it somewhat: I hadn't fully read the initial problem, so just to address that:\r\n\r\nIn the context of specifying a shell for VSCode, you _do_ want the profile/initialization scripts to be sourced (using the example of `bash`):\r\n\r\n* On Linux, terminal programs create interactive _non-login_ shells by default. Linux users keep their initialization commands in `~/.bashrc`, because that file is the _only_ (user-level) file that is sourced automatically when such a shell is created.\r\n\r\n  * VSCode's default configuration emulates this behavior by passing _no_ arguments to `/bin/bash` on Linux, which creates the same type of shell (interactive, non-login - when run in a terminal).\r\n\r\n* On macOS, by contrast, the default terminal program creates interactive _login_ shells - that is, `/bin/bash` is always implicitly started with `-l`. The _only_ (user-level) file that Bash _login_ shells automatically source is `~/.bash_profile` (not also `~/.bashrc`). Therefore, some macOS users keep all their initialization commands in `~/.bash_profile` only.\r\n\r\n     * VSCode's default configuration emulates this behavior by passing `-l` to `/bin/bash` on macOS, which creates a logon shell.\r\n\r\nThese platform differences are unfortunate, but they ultimately go back to the questionable behavior of not _also_ loading `~/.bashrc` in an interactive _login_ shell.   \r\nArguably, the aspects of login and interactive should be separate: source `~/.bashrc` whenever the shell is _interactive_ (whether also a login shell or not), and source `~/.bash_profile` whenever the shell is a _login_ shell (whether also interactive or not).\r\n(Presumably, Bash was following historical practice there.)\r\n\r\nTo compensate for this quirk, it is common practice to _manually_ source `~/.bashrc` from `~/.bash_profile` (sometimes complemented with a check inside `~/.bashrc` that aborts its loading if the shell is found to be _non-interactive_), by adding an _explicit command_ to `~/.bash_profile`.\r\nHowever, this is nothing more than a (inconsistently adhered-to) _convention_.\r\n\r\nFortunately, PowerShell has no technical debt in that specific regard, but it is already at odds with respect to `-NoProfile` and `-NonInteractive`, both of which invert the logic of POSIX-like shells.\r\n\r\n",
