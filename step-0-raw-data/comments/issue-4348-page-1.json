The provided value should be used only as a value for a preference parameter, and has been replaced by the default value. For more information, see the Help topic, \"about_Preference_Variables.\"\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Test-EAPreference -ErrorAction Ignore\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Test-EAPreference], NotSupportedException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.NotSupportedException,Test-EAPreference\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to docs, that's a bug, correct? Because technically the function is setting `ErrorActionPreference`, but from an end user's perspective, they're just using Ignore with `-ErrorAction` which should work just fine. I felt it was worth mentioning with this bug because this is a scenario where the prevention logic is being too strict, causing a bug.",

    "body": "There's more to this. The fact that it works in a script is simply because the logic internally was written incorrectly, only preventing `$ErrorActionPreference` from having a value of `[System.Management.Automation.ActionPreference]::Ignore` (e.g. an enumerated value). Having a value that is of type string (which is what happens whenever you create a locally scoped `$ErrorActionPreference` value -- it doesn't have to be in a script at all) allows `Ignore` to work just fine. You can also delete the top level `$ErrorActionPreference` variable, which is strongly typed as an `ActionPreference`, and then recreate it as a string and again it works.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nRemove-Variable -Name ErrorActionPreference\r\n[string]$ErrorActionPreference = 'Ignore'\r\nfunction Test-Ignore {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    Get-Process -Id 12345678\r\n}\r\nTest-Ignore # Ignores the error because it uses the ErrorActionPreference variable of type string\r\nTest-Ignore -ErrorAction Ignore # Raises the error about using Ignore because internally it creates a strongly typed ErrorActionPreference variable of type ActionPreference, sets the value as Ignore, and then when an error comes up that would otherwise be ignored, generates the `NotSupportedException`.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat, combined with the example below, demonstrates how terrible a job PowerShell is doing in this case, when really this is a linting problem, not something that the parser/compiler/interpreter should care about at all.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfunction Test-Ignore2 {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    'No errors to see here, move along'\r\n}\r\nTest-Ignore2 -ErrorAction Ignore # I can use this for functions some of the time, as long as they don't have errors to ignore? *sigh*\r\n```\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT: Here's one for a committee meeting. Please give the green light to just remove the nonsensical code blocking Ignore from `$ErrorActionPreference` (but only some of the time, as this illustrates), in favor of a PSSA rule to warn folks who don't know better instead.",

Do we need to keep `ActionPreference.Suspend` around at this point or can we just chuck it and the half-dozen checks related to it?",
