    "body": "`less` in PowerShell does not create backpressure like `Out-Host -Paging`. Imagine you have a cmdlet that reads and outputs huge amount of data. Piping it into `Out-Host -Paging` will make sure the cmdlet will only read as much data as is actually visible on the page, and create backpressure until the user scrolls down. Also, when quitting, the cmdlet's execution will be aborted. This is extremely useful for commands that stream large amounts of expensive-to-compute data (basically, all commands where you would want to use a pager).\r\n\r\nBoth do not happen with `less`. Pipe the cmdlet into `less`, and it will keep reading and outputting more and more data (potentially from an infinite data source!) that gets sent to less and buffered in memory by `less`. When quitting `less` nothing actually happens if the cmdlet didn't terminate yet, you need to Ctrl+C it manually.\r\n\r\nProof:\r\nDefine this function:\r\n```powershell\r\n$i = 0\r\nfunction test() {\r\n  while ($true) {\r\n    $global:i++\r\n    $global:i\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow run `test | Out-Host -Paging`, wait a bit without scrolling, and quit.\r\nCheck `$i` in the terminal. It should be the last number that was on screen, e.g. 32.\r\n\r\nNow run `test | less`, wait a bit without scrolling, and quit. Ctrl+C to terminate the cmdlet (needed).\r\nCheck `$i` again. It will be a huge number like 6574, because the cmdlet kept producing output even though the user did not scroll further.",

    "body": "`Out-Host -paging` is really bare bones.. and not always functional.   While I realize that the different platforms have different paging tools, to me, this is not an acceptable experience.  My PS experience should be as identical as possible between the platforms, and should *not* depend on using separate OS executables to provide some relatively basic functionality.  More on Windows is different than More on Linux is _probably_ different than More on Mac.  And of course Less is different and not present on Windows.  This means my experience is either very stripped down with `Out-host -paging` or I have learn/memorize all these different syntaxes and account for them in what I do - _if_ it even works.  ",
