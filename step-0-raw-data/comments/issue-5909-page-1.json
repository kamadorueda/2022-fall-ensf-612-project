    "body": "> It is definitely a bad practice\r\n\r\nThis argument fails when you realize that so many practices fall in this paradigm and the only difference is the protocol (HTTP/HTTPS vs SMB, SSH, SCP, etc). Even installing modules from the PS gallery fits this paradigm. Running code from sanctioned repos fits this paradigm.... really it exists in so many forms but people only complain about HTTP/HTTPS. *shrugs\r\n\r\n> Personally, I would object adding -EvaluateContent parameter ...\r\n\r\nI agree with that.\r\n\r\n> Also, I can't see a reason to create new cmdlet for that (Invoke-WebExpression), because at minimum it will duplicate full IWR functionality\r\n\r\nSo? Its not hard to do. The Web Cmdlet base class is flexible and designed for purpose built spin-offs like this. if I knew how to \"dot source\" in C# I could have a working cmdlet for this in maybe an hour or two. It's somewhat trivial to implement.\r\n\r\n> without any real improvement to usage case.\r\n\r\nDownloading and executing code doesn't have a use case?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/9bedef0c62614029a8892b0477b15cafbe1040b3/tools/releaseBuild/Images/microsoft_powershell_windowsservercore/dockerInstall.psm1#L28\r\n\r\nBut seriously, it does. With what @Jaykul discussed implemented, storing signed code on a repo and executing it is a pretty legit use case.\r\n\r\n> Finally, you can add some parameter to iex, but\r\n\r\nI agree it doesn't belong there.\r\n\r\n> So, IMHO, it does not worth the hassle.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to code it. :) \r\n\r\n> So why waste time and resources?\r\n\r\nLet's not let convenience become irrelevant in this project.\r\n\r\nOne benefit of it being an included command with restrictions in place would be to encourage adoption of better practices. Yes, user can and will always fall back to iex+iwr. Yes, old documentation, misguded blogs, and Open Source Project will still have examples of iex+iwr. But, we have an opportunity to 1) make it easier for doing this kind of thing which is common and necessary (like it or not) 2) recommend best practices.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to worry about resources. This is an Open Source project. If this cmdlet were even accepted by the PowerShell Team, they would likely not be the ones implementing it. They would put it up for grabs and someone like myself could work on it. ",

    "body": "Since #8816 was closed as a duplicate, let me summarize it here:\r\n\r\nAdding the proposed functionality to `Invoke-Expression` seems ill-advised, for the following reasons:\r\n  * primarily, [we want to discourage `Invoke-Expression` use in general](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2011/06/03/invoke-expression-considered-harmful/).\r\n  * (a moot point, based on the above, but there are problems with `exit` handling, the inability to run in a child scope, and a couple of bugs, #8778 and #8815; @SteveL-MSFT came up with a clever workaround that addresses all issues except the `exit` behavior; e.g.: <br>`iex \"& { $(irm https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1) } -Preview\"`)\r\n  *  the command name doesn't quite convey the intent of the operation (that is, invoking a _script_)\r\n  \r\nEnhancing `Invoke-Command` is a more natural fit, given that a(n external) _script_ is a sub-type of a _command_.\r\n\r\nAdapting @lzybkr's idea would give us (using the URL of PowerShell's own installation script, with `-Preview` as a pass-thru argument):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Via the pipeline, using the existing -ArgumentList / -Args parameter to pass arguments through.\r\niwr https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1 | icm -- -Preview\r\n\r\n# Less conveniently, with direct argument (-WebRequest could bind positionally).\r\nicm -WebRequest (iwr https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1) -- -Preview\r\n```\r\n<sup>Note: I'm assuming that `-Preview` is _passed through_ to the target script via a `ValueFromRemainingArguments` parameter that collects all arguments not meant for `Invoke-Command` itself; preceding such pass-through arguments with `--` (which is itself removed by the parameter binder) disambiguates and makes the pass-through intent obvious; the alternative is to stick with having to pass pass-through arguments via `-ArgumentList` / `-Args`, but that is less convenient.</sup>\r\n\r\nBelow is a proof of concept written in PowerShell, temporarily named `icmw` / `Invoke-CommandFromWebRequest`; if you substitute `icmw` for `icm` in the above commands, they should work on all platforms and also in Windows PowerShell.  \r\nOn Windows, the execution policy is enforced, unless `-Force` is passed.\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-Alias icmw Invoke-CommandFromWebRequest\r\nfunction Invoke-CommandFromWebRequest {\r\n  <#\r\n  .SYNOPSIS\r\n    Executes a .ps1 script downloaded via Invoke-WebRequest.\r\n  .DESCRIPTION\r\n    Enables convenient direct execution of .ps1 scripts available online,\r\n    typically for running / bootstrapping installation tasks, via the output\r\n    from an Invoke-WebRequest call that retrieves the script.\r\n  .PARAMETER WebRequest\r\n    The result of an Invoke-WebRequest that downloads a .ps1 script\r\n    as a plain-text resource.

This would mean `Get-Content https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1` would work.\r\n\r\n@vexx32 responded:\r\n\r\n> implementing such a provider would be interesting to say the least. Love the idea, though!\r\n> [...]\r\n> If it can utilise the web cmdlets' base functionality, we can hopefully avoid having two disparate sets of features for the same thing here.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov demonstrated how this could simplify the use case at hand:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nicm https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1\r\n\r\n# or even:\r\n& https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHe suggests fleshing out the idea in an RFC and has created a reminder issue for one at #8835.\r\n\r\n",
