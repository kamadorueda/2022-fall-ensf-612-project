    "body": "The failures are legit - in some cases we can't glob.\n\nAt a minimum, I think we can't do globbing on Windows at all - Windows tools implement globbing themselves, so even if we did something, it might work differently than the tool we're calling.\n\nThat said, we still need to be smarter somehow as the test failure demonstrates (basically `powershell -command \"[Console]::WriteLine(1)\"`.  I think we're treating the left of `::` as a provider (like filesystem) and don't recognize it as a provider.\n\nAt a minimum, I think we need a way to escape globbing characters, but that's messy.  `--%` helps here, the test failure wouldn't be a problem in this implementation if it used `--%`, but that's half the solution because you may want to mix arguments with globbing and no globbing, hence the need for some escape.\n\nThe question is - where do process escapes?  If it was just in the native command processor, it's less risky, but also less useful.  If we do it in the globbing code, we also run a greater risk of breaking something.\n\nI'm fine with punting the escape character for now, make that an issue, but put the globbing under `#if UNIX` and fix the test to use `--%`.\n",
