You could do this for example as follows, I recommend putting `[feature]` in the message so that more advanced tests run as well to test your change, which would be useful for this PR.\r\n```\r\ngit commit -m [feature] --allow-empty\r\ngit push\r\n```\r\n\r\n@iSazonov This happened to me last week as well that a build got into a hanging state.
