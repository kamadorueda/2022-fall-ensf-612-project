This will be the user's default install location. A shared \"all user\" location would need to be where PowerShell resides, so `/opt/microsoft/powershell/PackageManagement`. But that likewise makes me uncomfortable as the powershell folder is owned by the package, which has every right to rewrite the whole folder on upgrade. Perhaps go up a directory, to `/opt/microsoft/PackageManagement`. @raghushantha what do you think?\n> </details>\n> I didn't separate user installation and admin installation location because if an admin wants to, he/she can still specify the Destination directly. Also, @andschwa , is there a way to check whether the cmdlet is run on sudo or not?\n\n---\n\n_Comments from [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io:443/reviews/powershell/powershell/1282)_\n\n<!-- Sent from Reviewable.io -->\n",
