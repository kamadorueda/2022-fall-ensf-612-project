The issue is not related to the wldp.dll, however I still feel this fix is correct and should be taken.\r\n\r\nThe problem is the debugger disabling work that went into the current preview builds.  The script debugger is now disabled if the system is locked down, and any attempt to change debugger state is guarded by a system lock down check.  System lock down state is normally cached, but for the (normal) case where no policy is applied then a check is always performed for debug hooks (__PSLockdownPolicy) for testing purposes, and these checks include environment and registry settings.  Note that this perf problem only occurs when a debug breakpoint is set.\r\n\r\nI'll work on a fix for this and create a new PR.\r\n\r\n",

I simply repro'd that issue (setting debug break point causes serious perf problem) and found it was a regression from the debugger disabling change.  I think there is also a PInvoke perf problem as well, apparently due to a Windows security fix.  But this particular issue is due to a regression caused by a previous code change.\r\n\r\nI'll create a PR with the fix.",
