If there is no difference, then we will make `Target` an alias property in PowerShell that points to `LinkTarget`, because removing `Target` is a breaking change.\r\n\r\nAccording to @carlossanlop, the functionality of `LinkTarget` is not in parity with the existing `Target`, so let's hold off this change until the functionality is proven to be in parity. I will close this PR for now.",
