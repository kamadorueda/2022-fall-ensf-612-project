Otherwise, `EndProcessing` will run after after the last input object is received for each command:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$one = { end { 0; Write-Host '1 end called' }}\r\n$two = { process { $_ } end { Write-Host '2 end called' }}\r\n$three = { process { } end { Write-Host '3 end called'; 0..2;}}\r\n$four = { process { Write-Host $_ } end { Write-Host '4 end called' }}\r\n\r\n& $one | & $two | & $three | & $four\r\n\r\n1 end called\r\n2 end called\r\n3 end called\r\n0\r\n1\r\n2\r\n4 end called\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the original issue, the idea was that if you add `Out-String` before `Set-Content` then `Get-Content` should be disposed after `Out-String` has consumed all of it's output.  That would be after `EndProcessing` runs for `Get-Content`, but before it runs for `Out-String`.",
