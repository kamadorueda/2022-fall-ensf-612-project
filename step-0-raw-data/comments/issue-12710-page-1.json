    "body": "The problem I have is that I would like to create stable mapped drives on my computer. I can do this in explorer by mapping those drives (to a Synology device) but as this device is not in a domain I use the Synology account to make the mapping. That works, but each time I start my machine I need to provide the (Synology account) password again. To avoid this I wanted to use this script to automate the login process.\r\nThe script I wrote does this within the PowerShell environment, but not on the level of the OS, although the documentation clearly states this is possible. So what is wrong in my approach or what could I do to pinpoint the root cause of the failure?",
