I don't think this should just sit idle, waiting for a \"more diverse discussion with agreement on the problem and proposed solution\" to happen. The PS team and/or the PS committee should discuss this important issue, and figure out what they want to do about it, leading the community toward a path of success as we head into the release of PowerShell 7.",
