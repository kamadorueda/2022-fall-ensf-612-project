Personally I find anything with more than three digits is hard to follow, especially if it's being updated constantly.\r\n\r\nIt seems you do formal answer without analyzing. We read the stream in chunks of 10 Kbytes. Why do we need formatting code for bytes?! \r\nThen also consider the normal speed for modern channels and the size of common files... Or do you really download 1EB size files everyday? :-) And so on ...\r\n\r\n> I mean we're ultimately having a perf discussion; some measurements would be useful (would welcome any from @bergmeister as well). This is ultimately an interactive/UI change, so I think one thing to keep in mind is that we can freely revert it or otherwise change it if we find performance issues.\r\n\r\n1. We already have an experience about progress bar slow down extremely the cmdlet. My fix was a minor workaround. Ideally we should re-design and re-implement the code based on the experience. At the very least, we should not ignore this experience and repeat past mistakes.\r\n2. I don't understand why do we use old school patterns if we can freely benefit from modern C# and Runtime features. (They may be unfamiliar but quite readable.)\r\n3. For me, PowerShell is a base platform for other applications. We cannot know what is critical for these applications. So any code should not consume more resources than necessary - we have no right to waste other people's money.\r\n4. The classic requirement for an interactive scenario is that the time the user receives a response should not exceed 5 seconds, otherwise it is no longer an interactive scenario. So progress bar is a helper to transform non-interactive scenario to interactive one.  The purpose of the progress bar is to give the user answers to two questions at least once every 5 seconds - (1) does the process continue well?, (2) how much longer do we have to wait?\r\nIf we follow these simple requirements, we do not need to make additional efforts to revert PR. :-)",

So wasn't this a perf issue before this PR?  Or was your perf fix in `Write-Progress`?  If that is the case, then to prevent unnecessary heap allocs in code **calling** Write-Progress, we need an API something like `bool ShouldWriteProgress()`.  Then you'd only compute the percent displayed strings if the progress was actually going to be written.  But ... I'm way out on a branch here since I don't really know how the perf of write-progress was originally addressed.",

However, here we are discussing the performance impact of something much less expensive. Originally I did some maths (logarithm, etc.) to figure out whether it's KB vs MB and was willing to change it to this hard-coded switch statement, which should be super fast now since the compiler can build jump tables. Yet, this does not seem to be enough and we are discussing whether to use a static formatting string or different one depending on size and whether to cater for one order of magnitude more or less. I already did a small perf test with the original implementation and could not find an easily measurable difference in my comment https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14611#discussion_r558571942, therefore only a micro-benchmark would be able to tell the difference, which would imply that we are talking about micro-optimization in an area that is used by a cmdlet and not something generic and highly re-used in the engine.\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for from the PowerShell team or committee is an agreement on the actions that are needed for merging this PR because I and others seem to disagree on some points so want to avoid making changes that are not actually wanted or needed or changing back and forth.",

    "body": "So I've done a simple perf test on a standard 4 core Azure VM and download a 1GB test file, with networking speeds of around 1 GB/s and most of the time is actually spent in some after-processing after the download progress bar has finished). Due to high networking fluctuations, results did vary quite a bit but I could not notice a difference. I ran the below command\r\n```pwsh\r\n(1..10 | foreach { measure-command { $null = Invoke-WebRequest 'https://speed.hetzner.de/1GB.bin'}; [gc]::Collect(); sleep 2 }).Milliseconds | measure -AllStats\r\n```\r\nResults were for current master:\r\n```\r\nCount             : 10\r\nAverage           : 472.4\r\nSum               : 4724\r\nMaximum           : 817\r\nMinimum           : 233\r\nStandardDeviation : 194.58628477419\r\nProperty          :\r\n```\r\nResult for my branch (rebased to latest master):\r\n```\r\nCount             : 10\r\nAverage           : 412.8\r\nSum               : 4128\r\nMaximum           : 872\r\nMinimum           : 189\r\nStandardDeviation : 208.655377756402\r\nProperty          :\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore to me that is proof anything that any other micro-optimization would not be noticeable, running a micro-benchmark of this is out of scope for me.\r\n\r\nThe last concern was around so called dead code for the KB and EB entries in the switch statement. First of all, originally, this piece of code was a private function just for this cmdlet but I was asked to move it to the SMA project (which I didn't agree with at the time anyway as it will make it harder to create a lightweight version of PowerShell with fewer out of the box modules...) and therefore I had to make it internal, meaning any other consumers could use this utility function and could trip over by a missing range functionality. As the compiler builds jump tables for such switch statements anyway, I think the performance impact of having additional entries is negligible and performance is something that should be analyzed for rather being prematurely optimized, I also think we are comparing apples with pears as the previous reason for the slowness of `Invoke-Webrequest` was a very expensive operation, which was the refresh of the progress pane/",

PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detected.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiYmVyZ21laXN0ZXIiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTQ2MTEiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJUaHVtYnNVcCJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiYmVyZ21laXN0ZXIiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTQ2MTEiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJOZXV0cmFsIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiYmVyZ21laXN0ZXIiLCJSZXBvc2l0b3J5TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwiLCJQdWxsUmVxdWVzdExpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL3B1bGwvMTQ2MTEiLCJFdmVudFR5cGUiOiJUaHVtYnNEb3duIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",
