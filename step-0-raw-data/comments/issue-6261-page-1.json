    "body": "@AikenBM:\r\n\r\nRe `-Root`:\r\n\r\nI agree that `-Root` is inappropriate, for the reasons you state.\r\n\r\nRe `-Leaf`:\r\n\r\n> Technically, v1.0 isn't a leaf. \r\n\r\nIt is, just in a different sense than used by `Test-Path`:\r\n\r\n* With `Split-Path`, a leaf is a property of an _abstract path_: It is a path's _last component_, irrespective of what that path represents in the real world (and whether it can have \"children\" or not). As such, _every_ path has a leaf.\r\n\r\n* By contrast, `Test-Path` examines precisely what _item type_ a path refers to and tests its _intrinsic (non-)ability_ to have child items. In this sense, there are providers that have no \"leaf\" items at all, such as the registry provider, whose items are (just) registry _keys_, and all keys can have child keys.\r\n\r\nThis conflation can be confusing, but you could argue that it is `Test-Path`'s use of the term that is less intuitive.\r\n\r\nRe `-Child`:\r\n\r\n**There is no need for symmetry of _terms_ here, because there is no symmetry of _concepts_:**\r\n\r\nThe starting point is a given path, whose components `Split-Path` extracts.\r\n\r\nAll you need are terms for the _components_ you want to extract, and _parent_ and _leaf_ are sensible names for the components in question, from a tree/path viewpoint:\r\n\r\n* `-Leaf` is the input path's last component.\r\n* `-Parent` is the input path's parent path (the path you get when you drop the leaf component)\r\n\r\nThere is no \"child\" here - only the input path _itself_ - and its components.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn short: I don't see a need for a change here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
