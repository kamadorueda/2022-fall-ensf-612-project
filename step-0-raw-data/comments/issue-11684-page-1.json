However, \r\nI teach students to do this:\r\n```powershell\r\ngal -def get-alias\r\n```\r\nI also train them on when and when not to use aliases. \r\n\r\nEven if we wanted this feature, using Tab today does do _something useful, If you type a tab after a cmdlet name, PowerShell iterates through items based on the cmdlet (eg with Get-Alias <tab> it runs through the aliases, Get-ChildItem <tab> runs through files.  Changing this behaviour to show aliases is not helpful. Tabl Completion is about _completing_ a command line, not in showing alternatives (eg aliases). \r\n\r\nTL;DR - I am not convinced we need such a device and in any case, it changes existing behaviour in a way less helpful.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
