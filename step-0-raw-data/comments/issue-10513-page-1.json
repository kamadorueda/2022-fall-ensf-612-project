    "body": "WG-Engine discussed this today.\r\n\r\nWe agree that it makes sense to add a type accelerator here so that [ordered] can be used for `-is` comparisons and for directly constructing an OrderedDictionary with `[ordered]::new()`. This is a fairly straightforward change so we're happy to mark this as up for grabs.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a parser check that prevents the usage of `[ordered]$a` for anything other than a hashtable literal (`[ordered]@{ a = 1 }`) which we agree should remain in place for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n1. There is currently no usable direct casts to an OrderedDictionary that this code path could take\r\n2. Casting a non-ordered Dictionary/hashtable type to OrderedDictionary is always going to result in the same unordered keys as can be gotten from the non-ordered Dictionary type anyway; going from an unordered type to an ordered type after the dictionary has been constructed does not make sense.\r\n\r\nGiven this, we think that simply adding a new type accelerator with no other changes makes sense here. It will enable the desired scenario and requires minimal changes.\r\n\r\nEDIT: For those wanting to implement the change, the accelerator would be added to this list:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/7dc4587014bfa22919c933607bf564f0ba53db2e/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/TypeResolver.cs#L724-L815",
