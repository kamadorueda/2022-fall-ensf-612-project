A dotnet/corefx issue has been filed: https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/19731\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that powershell successfully casts the `ShellWindows` object to `IEnumerable`, and then a `TypeLoadException` is thrown when calling `GetEnumerator()` on the `IEnumerable` object. PowerShell catches the exception and treat the object as non-enumerable.",

    "body": "Reply from `CoreCLR` team on dotnet/corefx#19731\r\n> Thanks for reporting this issue. As previously discussed, CoreCLR doesn't support IDispatch (and that's why you are implementing your own IDispatch). IEnumerable.GetEnumerator uses IDispatch.Invoke(DISPID_NEWENUM) under the hood (that's the convention for IDispatch objects to support enumeration). You need to write your own enumeration code to support that pattern in CoreCLR. Based on what you already have (IDispatch and VARIANT support), it should be pretty straight-forward. I'll be happy to help out offline if you need any help.\r\n\r\nSo we need to write the enumeration code ourselves.",
