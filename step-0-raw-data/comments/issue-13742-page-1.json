Does the behaviour still vary across Windows patch versions with PowerShell 7?)\r\n2. Not really an issue in PowerShell itself, merely the result of a change in Windows or in the module Windows provides to interact with certificates.\r\n\r\nIs that accurate? If so, I'm not sure there's much the powershell team can do here. ðŸ˜• ",
