PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detetcted.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiamJvcmVhbjkzIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE2OTk1IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiVGh1bWJzVXAifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiamJvcmVhbjkzIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE2OTk1IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiTmV1dHJhbCJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiamJvcmVhbjkzIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE2OTk1IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiVGh1bWJzRG93biJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> I don't like this trimming algorithm. We should create a minimum acceptable pipe name, and if it is too long to implement, then throw an error.\r\n\r\nI agree but that is the current implementation today, this PR is just trying to get it working again. If you wish to not even support trimming I'm happy to remove all that code and just rely on the pipe either being created and long paths failing during that phase. The trouble with a minimum acceptable pipe name is that it has 2 parts that can be variable:\r\n\r\n* The pipe path as it relies on whatever `TMPDIR` is set to\r\n* The process name as it relies on whatever the executable is called\r\n\r\nThe rest is quite small today but even attempting to change it will result in a breaking change so there's not much we can do to slim it down more.\r\n\r\n> Name uniqueness is important to prevent spoofing attack, so we don't want to arbitrarily trim it ... I like the addition of required unique length, and I feel 8 digits provides enough uniqueness for non-Windows platforms.\r\n\r\nYea that's why I set the minimum length to include the process start time and pid. I can change it to only do the start time if that is your wish but at that point we are only really saving ~5 characters so it's going to be very limited in it's use. Ultimately a longer pipe path is broken today and if you wish to remove the complexity here I'll be happy with that as well.\r\n\r\n>  Also, the extension uses custom named pipes, but I don't think this change affects that.\r\n\r\nIf I understand correctly that shouldn't be affected by this but more than happy ot have some more reviews.",

    "body": "I'm totally happy with the outcome, would be great to simplify the code.\r\n\r\n> This pipe name creation code should be re-written to create the smallest name possible, while still having acceptable uniqueness. If name/path is too long then throw and error (for PowerShell simply do not start a named pipe listener).\r\n\r\nThis makes sense but brings up the next question, what is considered unique. Right now the pipe is essentially `/tmp/CoreFxPipe_PSHost.{start_time}.{pid}.None.{proc_name}`. Can we safely remove any of those parts (Culture/None would be one of them) but the process name will always lead to some variable length potentially exceeding the max length.\r\n\r\nA potential option is to hash the same name format and just have `/tmp/CoreFxPipe_{hash}`. This allows pwsh to have a name as long as it wants for uniqueness with a fixed pipe name length. The only variable part here would be if someone has changed their `TMPDIR` env var to something other than `/tmp`. If this is desired the question would be what algorithm to use, here is what they would look like\r\n\r\n|Algorithm|Value|Length|\r\n|-|-|-|\r\n|None|/tmp/CoreFxPipe_PSHost.D837E104.23097.None.pwsh|47|\r\n|MD5|/tmp/CoreFxPipe_f970e2767d0cfe75876ea857f92e319b|48|\r\n|SHA1|/tmp/CoreFxPipe_a9993e364706816aba3e25717850c26c9cd0d89d|59|\r\n|SHA256|/tmp/CoreFxPipe_ba7816bf8f01cfea414140de5dae2223b00361a396177a9cb410ff61f20015ad|80|\r\n\r\nMD5 while close may not be workable in FIPS enabled hosts + may not be secure enough for what pwsh is trying to avoid. SHA1 is only slightly longer but I'm also unsure if it's ok to use in this type of scenario. SHA256 should be unique enough to avoid collisions but is a bit longer. Considering the variability comes from the `TMPDIR` path maybe that's an acceptable compromise.\r\n\r\nTechnically we could even shorten this even more by defining a rooted path as the pipe name, say `/tmp/PS_{hash}` to avoid the `CoreFxPipe_` prefix if we wanted to eek out a few more characters available for a custom `TMPDIR`. The disadvantages I see this this are:\r\n\r\n* I'm unsure how long .NET supported a rooted path pipe name so older pwsh versions may not work\r\n* A client would also need to pass in a rooted path for the pipe name when connecting to it, today they just need to specify the `PSHost_...` part\r\n* Does the extra complexity really offset the advantages here?\r\n\r\nAnother question that comes up is whether the same change should happen on Windows. Should it also have the same setup or continue being what it does today?",
