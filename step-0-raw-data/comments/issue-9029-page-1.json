While I was working on it, it turned out that these changes are very sensitive, while the diagnosis is very scanty. If someone changes an internal api, then pwsh can fall with a non-informative error and it will be very difficult to find the cause of the problem. The change doesn't add more information in error message but reduces the likelihood of conflicts and as a result simplify diagnostic.",
