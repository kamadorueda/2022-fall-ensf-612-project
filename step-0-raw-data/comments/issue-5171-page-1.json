PSDepend was written to do a few things I thought would be helpful, with awesome contributions along the way - that said, the code/design has never been refactored, is messy as hell, and will need serious work for core/xplat support\r\n- Edit:  It **should support PowerShell Core and xplat**, with allowances for OS specific dependency types\r\n- More (e.g. min or max version support).  These are just initial thoughts given that PSDepend came up...\r\n\r\nSo!\r\n\r\nI'd be happy if folks contributed to PSDepend, but perhaps even more happy if the PowerShell team, or other more knowledgeable folks crafted a dependency management module from the ground up, even if they borrow ideas\r\n\r\nCheers!",
