This is the behavior I would expect to see on both file and folders because PowerShell supports a lot of architectures : x86, x86_64, arm, arm64 ... I think it could even be compiled to unsupported architectures.\r\nSo yeah, it would be awesome that it be fixed.\r\nAlso it would be nice to get the same kind of behavior for previous versions of PowerShell, like PowerShell 5.1.0.\r\nMaybe a script to add more PowerShell context menu in Windows?\r\nSorry if I'm asking too much.\nBy the way,\nHappy New Year 2021.",
