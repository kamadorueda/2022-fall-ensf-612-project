The REST API is requiring the same methods as above to login. \r\n\r\nIn my case, I didn't use the PSCX extensions though and just did the Base64 conversions in .NET manually. Then, I wrapped it in it's own function, so that all my Device42 cmdlets can reuse the logic. \r\n\r\nThe `-UseBasicAuth` parameter is needed for both Invoke-WebRequest and Invoke-RestMethod.\r\n\r\n@rkeithhill based on the doc you linked, I think `-UseBasicAuth` should be a string with a `[ValidateSet]` attribute that can allow user to set the different methods of Basic Authentication that exist.",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT I was thinking maybe OAuth could be an alias for `Bearer`. It's not easily resolved because many APIs require a `Basic` auth with the a combination of user/pass or client-id/client-secret and that is just as much OAuth as `Bearer` in some users' eyes.\r\n\r\nToken could work. But it would be highly specialized for just OAuth.  For `Basic`, there are many APIs that use it outside the context of OAuth where token makes no sense and Credential does. It could be a sort of \"alias\" for `-Credential` in that it is a real separate parameter but under the hood implements the same object with some error detection if both are supplied. but I feel that somewhat over complicates things.

It should probably warn for anytime `-Credential` is supplied. That would get annoying for console users accessing a site/api that has basic auth though. At worst It might lead them to disabling all warnings. 👎 Adding a `-force` seems a bit.. awkward... for the web cmdlets. hrm\r\n\r\nPart me also feels that it should just be a given that these credentials are being sent insecurely. I realize that's not the case, but, most forms are not doing any kind of client side encryption or encoding either before passing on credentials over the pipe as form fields.\r\n\r\nMaybe if it warned when not going over HTTPS?\r\n\r\nI'd like more feedback from others on this one.",

Reusability in custom cmdlets for other scenarios where a `token` or `passphrase` is needed. Custom SSH cmdlets come to mind. Everyone gets confused about how to do passphrase securely with PSCredential.\r\n3. Create a standard method like `GetNetworkCredential()` called `GetToken()`.

    "body": "What if you could use this as an excuse to start moving in the direction browsers are starting to go, where they are warning users about any and all [pages that are http](http://www.zdnet.com/article/google-tightens-noose-on-http-chrome-to-stick-not-secure-on-pages-with-search-fields/)? \r\n\r\nA credential going over an un-encrypted connection is just the most obvious danger, but if it's the cmdlet authors job to warn users about things that are dangerous, you have to admit that you don't know what they are putting in the -Body parameter either.\r\n\r\nTo me, that argues for something like the following behavior\r\n1. Implement a new parameter called ```-AllowUnEncryptedConnections```\r\n2. Any request whatever, to an http site would result in output to the Warning Stream wagging a finger at the user. Why any and all requests? Because even a regular GET to a non-ssl site can reveal compromising data if the returned page content contains sensitive data. \r\n3. Any request, including those with credentials, that use the ```-AllowUnEncryptedConnections``` switch would not have that warning output.\r\n\r\nTo me, that allows the cmdlet to take the threat from unencrypted connections seriously and treat it comprehensively. Writing a warning rather than an error seems a good compromise rather than blocking the cmdlet from executing and breaking lots of people's scripts. \r\n\r\nThat said, I realize this is a bit of an extreme position to take, so I'm fine with an ```-AllowUnencrypedAuthorization``` parameter too if that's as far you are willing to push it.",
