Or just flat out parse hex *only* as `[u]int[16|32|64]`\r\n\r\nWhat exactly is the desired behaviour of hex literals? Because in my parsing them as `bigint` either I've made them better or worse, and I don't work with them enough to know which is which!\r\n\r\nAlso, parsing purely as `BigInteger` for all non-`real` types and then casting seems to have sped up the parser a good bit as opposed to doing sequential `TryParse`s.",

    "body": "OK So essentially if you have a hex value that is a multiple of 8 digits it expects a sign bit and adheres to it. Otherwise it assumes the value is positive when parsing (if you have a negative sign before the hex literal it is still respected and flips the final value).\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really make... sense... (in my opinion) for the value to go into doubles territory -- that's kind of against the point of *using* hex (unit precision) so since we already parse as `bigint` in this region (and always have, I've just kind of rolled it all together here) I figured if you're asking for a hex literal *that* big you might actually need it for some insane scenario and thought -- why not just yield the `bigint` value already there for the taking.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on it, though, as always! This is filtered through my own brain, so there may well be stuff in here that we should avoid doing for reasons I haven't thought of yet (yes `bigint` can cause OOM errors but the parser is already using it to check bounds anyway and always has; this won't introduce any new overflow possibilities that weren't already there just by virtue of entering stupidly huge decimals).\r\n\r\n@iSazonov @rjmholt @lzybkr \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32407840/44304417-72371800-a329-11e8-8450-705a46f4bdb7.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32407840/44304421-82e78e00-a329-11e8-8841-b2faa5d2c84c.png)\r\n\r\nAnd regarding that failing test on `Get-Random`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Joel\\source\\repos\\PSCore\\PowerShell> get-random 0xfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff\r\n5.04272284445114E+39\r\n```\r\n^^ that is why. 😄 ",

    "body": "@vexx32 The PR is very large (many comments and commits). I suggest split the PR to simplify.\r\n1. Make new PR with new prefixes and tests - it already was approved by PowerShell Committee and we can fast review and merge.\r\n2. Make new PR with NumberSuffixFlags in ScanNumberHelper (using switch) + replace `Convert.ChangeType` with new convert helper methods - the temporary PR _without_ any fuctional changes can be fast reviewed and merged.\r\n\r\nAfter that we can close current PR and open new one with cleaned commits based on PowerShell Committee conclusion - commits with new suffixes and perhaps changes related hex/binary sign.",

Shouldn't be too hard to pull off. 😄 \r\n\r\nEDIT: as per #7575 I have split off the type suffix and accelerator changes.\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not able to do the two-char type suffix without either converting `suffix` to `string` or the enum, so I opted to retain the changes that work with the enum specifically.
