Did it work on previous older version of PerfView?\r\n\r\nNo, I started with old version (six months old).\r\n\r\nAlso there was a problem with .Net  https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/53743\r\n\r\n> 2. What's the root cause? Could it be a problem with the latest PerfView?\r\n\r\nFor .Net 5.0 and crossgen 1.0, PerfView generated ni.pdb files for PowerShell assemblies on the fly.\r\nNow it doesn't. When I try to load SMA.pdb, I see \"Out of memory\" message in the Perfview log.\r\nAfter I manually processed the SMA with crossgen2.exe I get SMA.ni.dll (with exactly the same size as original one) and SMA.ni.pdb. After renaming SMA.ni.dll to SMA.dll PerfView loads SMA.ni.pdb and show all callsites in trace.\r\n\r\nI can not point a root of the issue since crossgen2.exe is not well documented. But I found a comment that now PDB files contain a reference to ni.pdb. This force me think that our crossgen process is out of date.\r\n\r\n> 3. Removing `Newtonsoft.Json.dll` means it will not be pre-jitted, and that will impact the startup.\r\n> \r\n\r\nI measured and don't see noticeable difference (81 vs 80 ms for reading/parsing pwsh config on my notebook). I guess Newtonsoft.Json implementation is not optimized for .Net at all.\r\n\r\n> Given that, I will turn this into a draft for now.\r\n\r\nI don't know how fix right the issue with Newtonsoft.Json.dll but I am sure we should enable PublishReadyToRunEmitSymbols.\r\nI think it is a time to migrate from Newtonsoft.Json.dll to System.Text.Json in the config R/W scenario. _10% to read json config at startup is too many/slow_. I hope System.Text.Json will be a bit faster.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I have refreshed my early experiment with using System.Text.Json from .Net 5 to .Net 6.0 RC2 and now I see good perf win for ReadValueFromFile() ~4x.",

I see the `ReadyToRun` option after switching to that version.\r\n\r\n> System.IO.FileSystem.Primitives.dll is compiled for AnyCPU. So it can not be in R2R :-)\r\n\r\nYeah. both `System.Runtime.Extensions.dll` and `System.IO.FileSystem.dll` are also targeting AnyCPU. If you see that differently, you must be using the assembly that are further processed by `Start-Crossgen` in powershell build.\r\n\r\nThe .NET team has [confirmed](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/60779) that ALL .NET 6 runtime assemblies should be R2R images.\r\nBased on that, I opened https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/60782 to report the findings.\r\n**[Update]** It turns out this is by design because those assemblies as pure façade assemblies.\r\n\r\nI have also verified that `<PublishReadyToRun>true</PublishReadyToRun>` actually crossgen'ed all the package assemblies pwsh depends on, including all that in the [$commonAssembliesForAddType](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/e5d27d139c59a94931bf7767b7e17a4b3bc65d00/build.psm1#L2499-L2523) array today.
