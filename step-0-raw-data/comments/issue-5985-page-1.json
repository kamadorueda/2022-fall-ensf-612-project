If they can get a system service called `sshd` running, they already own the system.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov in the future we may need to consider other remote hosting models, but I don't image it would be pwsh itself running as a daemon.  OpenSSH is designed to be used not as a library.  Their client api is basically wrapping `ssh.exe`.  There are 3rd party SSH libraries, though.",
