Would that be sufficient or do you think we need to go to the cmdlet level?  If we split it out to a separate module, it is a breaking change.",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT: I've been thinking about this a lot, especially very recently because my need to use these cmdlets has increased dramatically, and I've come to the conclusion that the -Json cmdlets ultimately do need to be moved into their own module. Here is why:\r\n\r\n1. There are numerous design issues in the existing cmdlet implementation that cannot be addressed without introducing breaking changes.\r\n\r\n1. Having these cmdlets included in Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility allows for breaking changes to be introduced if the module uses semver versioning, but that module is far to big for that to be manageable (if breaking changes need to be made elsewhere, how does someone adopt some breaking changes that are important to them but not others).\r\n\r\nIt will be much better for these cmdlets, and likely other small sets of cmdlets, to move into standalone, backwards compatible modules that work both on PowerShell (Windows) and PSCore as design issues that require breaking changes are addressed, so that the issues can be fixed and so that the cmdlets are isolated in their own module, making manageability going forward much, much easier.\r\n\r\nI have already begun work on a separate module with ConvertTo-/ConvertFrom-Json cmdlets that address the issues I need addressed (I need these regardless of whether or not the resulting module becomes something that is adopted by the community).\r\n\r\nI don't believe you can possibly accomplish your \"awesome ConvertFrom/To-Json\" goal from #3046 unless you break existing functionality and spin these two cmdlets out into their own module.",
