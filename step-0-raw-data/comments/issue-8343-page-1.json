Those are both structured formats, and you would likely start reading in the middle of a closing tag or a JSON data field. Perhaps whatever high level check you are doing (\"that the structure ends properly\"?) would be better added in the XML or JSON processing areas rather than Get-Content.\r\n\r\n> What if I want the last 100 characters from a 2G file that isn't line delimited?\r\n\r\nPowerShell allows you to use .Net framework directly to do things it hasn't wrapped in cmdlets yet, so you can do this by opening the file and `Seek()`ing to a point somewhere before the end, e.g.\r\n\r\n    $numBytes = 20\r\n    $file = Get-Item -Path .\\bigfile.txt\r\n    \r\n    # Open file as a stream, \r\n    # and seek back from the end.\r\n    $stream = [System.IO.File]::OpenRead($file.FullName)\r\n    [void]$stream.Seek(-$numBytes, [System.IO.SeekOrigin]::End)\r\n    \r\n    # Read some bytes from it into a buffer,\r\n    # and decode them into text\r\n    $buffer = [byte[]]::new($numBytes)\r\n    [void]$stream.Read($buffer, 0, $numBytes)\r\n    $stream.Close()\r\n    [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetString($buffer)\r\n\r\nNB. you need to choose the [System.Text.Encoding] which matches the file's encoding, and account for the fact that reading 20 bytes won't always read 20 characters. UTF16 is 2-bytes-per-character so for that you'd need to read twice as many bytes as the character count. UTF8 is a variable width encoding so there's no way to know how many bytes to read, but it maxes out at 4-bytes-per-character, so you'd need to read four times the character count as bytes, and then trim down the resulting string if it turned into too many characters.",
