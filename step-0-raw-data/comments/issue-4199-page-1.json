This one requires changes to Windows in some form or another, as Windows PowerShell needs to be aware of PowerShell Core's existence (system32 PATH wins over ProgramFiles PATH in the vast majority of cases). Unless we give powershell.exe an symbolic link in $PSHome for PS6 like `ps6.exe`, but that's a crappy band-aid I'd rather avoid.\r\n1. Managing future side-by-side versions of PowerShell Core. I predict one day we might need something `venv` or `rbenv`, but not until *at least* 6.1. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure we want to dive in on the former *just yet*, but it would ideally be addressed around (or just after) the \"RTM\" of PowerShell Core 6.
