    "body": "Sure.\r\n\r\nI have been doing software deployment on both of these systems for well over a decade.\r\n\r\nHere is a good overview and proof of fairly extensive linux support: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INI_file.  It accurately points out Microsoft's steering away from them when the registry came about.\r\n\r\nThe INI file \"schema\" drifted a lot by incorrect usage of developers when they needed to get creative for things it did not handle well (which is why OS/2's registry was brought forward into Windows NT).\r\n\r\nYou can get a sense for it by analyzing the apis - to see the APIs, search for \"PrivateProfile\" from this page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/winbase/nf-winbase-getprivateprofilestringa\r\n\r\nInterestingly, now with Microsoft getting OpenSSH running on Windows, we regress to the stone age by configuring it with a CONF file.\r\n\r\nWhile INIs weren't great - CONF files are a huge antipattern - including for security.\r\n\r\nSince they do not enforce any type of structure they must be parsed with RegEx's - which opens up a lot of risk that a desired locked-down configuration won't be applicable to all systems and relies on the skill of every individual automator to make something that is both incisive and comprehensive.\r\n\r\nDue to this risk, most automators end up simply replacing the whole file - including with configuration management systems like chef, puppet, ansible, powershell DSC, etc, etc.\r\n\r\nThe problem with doing that is that it is the perspective of a fresh system setup.  Wiping out existing configurations on existing in-place systems for a new \"default\" can cause many problems in large environments where more than one mechanism many need to manage these files or some of their values may need to be user editable and persisted for non-security concerning settings.\r\n\r\nSo while I thought I could have no more hate for INI files - I embrace them with love compared to CONF files. ;)\r\n\r\nIf it were up to me - OpenSSH would optionally support an INI file and have it as the authoritative configuration if present.  Those who prefer the much less manageable and less secure CONF file could still use it by making sure an INI does not exist.\r\n\r\nSo I would say that not only is there a historic case for supporting them - they are eons ahead of the structureless CONF files that are so prevalent on Linux.",

    "body": "> Looks like there are some modules on powershellgallery.com specifically for working with ini files. It doesn't seem like this is something we need as part of PowerShell itself.\r\n\r\nThat's like the old \"I don't use it, so I don't understand why anyone else would.\"  Windows itself still has files in INI format, this is long long overdue.  But, people have been asking for it since Powershell came out, and they still haven't done it, because although they said powershell was for admins, they prioritized putting in programmer level things.   And XML and JSON were more important to the programmers.\r\n",
