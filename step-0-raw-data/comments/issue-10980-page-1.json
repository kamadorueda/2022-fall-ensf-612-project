    "body": "Does it give the same result if you switch the order of the comparison? There was a request for PowerShell to treat dbnull the same way it treats true $null; that is, all comparisons it plays a part in undergo the same type coercion as $null would.\r\n\r\nPowerShell will typically attempt to coerce the type of the operand on the right hand side of the operator to the same type as that on the left hand side. As such, you will sometimes have different results when swapping the order of the items you're comparing.\r\n\r\nIf I recall correctly you can also see the same difference with true $null: `$null -eq $false` vs `$false -eq $null`\r\n\r\nWe simply treat dbnull the same way as true null now. If you need to check for dbnull specifically, you can test `$value -is [dbnull]`",

Please let me know if there's anything else I can provide...  Thanks for your extremely fast response and help!\r\n\r\nTL;DR/:\r\nWhat prompted me to try this in the first place was attempting to only list attributes that had values when going through the object, where I had found with PSH 5 I had to test for both $null and [dbnull] in order to truly filter them out.  Some googling made me (gladly) see that PSH 7 had been updated to treat dbnull more like $null, which led me to test the results to validate...  \r\n\r\nAfter finding I had to update my scripts (that worked in PSH 5), to work with PSH 6/7 by adding the \".item(xx)\" along with the \"Add-Type\" _before even getting to test the results_, I just wanted to pass this along in case it ends up being something that needs to be fixed, or just ends up needing to be documented...  I'm still trying to find if both the .item/Add-Type issues I had before being able to test are known issues as well, or more likely I'm too dumb or blind to find them :), so figured I should at least bring this one up just in case..\r\n",
