GetVariableValue(VariablePath variablePath, ExecutionContext executionContext, VariableExpressionAst varAst)` return null, which triggers `ThrowStrictModeUndefinedVariable(executionContext, varAst)`. All global cases have identical callstack, the two working dynamic cases are also identical to each other and share top 9 functions of the global case.\r\n\r\nBut the failing dynamic += has completely different callstack, and does not even look for `$notexist` but for `$lastError`, probably completely unrelated but instead part of regular cleanup - confirmed by running `$x = 0; $x += 1` and still seeing `$lastError` lookup. So dynamic `+=` uses completely different codepath, that I am having trouble tracking down.",
