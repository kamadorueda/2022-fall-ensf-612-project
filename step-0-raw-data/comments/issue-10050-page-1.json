I would prefer to implement this all natively as well (ideally before loading/running .NET at all) but that poses complexity and maintenance challenges. Adding this functionality to PowerShell-Native is something that requires more investigation, but I think the hope is that we will eventually be able to do away with PowerShell-Native as well.",

We agreed that the current implementation is good enough for now and we want to investigate moving the underlying logic into PSNative for performance benefits\r\n\r\nYes, talked with Rob on this. P/Invoke itself is expensive, plus Jitting the P/Invoke code possibly will be more expensive than non-P/Invoke code.\r\nBy moving some of the P/Invoke heavy code (e.g. the code to get the first byte of the executable name and the executable path) to native code and simply calling one P/Invoke from managed code to get what we need would be more efficient.\r\nBut that can happen in a follow-up PR, not this one.\r\n\r\nSee [PInvoke Performance Considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/dotnet/calling-native-functions-from-managed-code?view=vs-2019#performance-considerations):\r\n> PInvoke has an overhead of between 10 and 30 x86 instructions per call. In addition to this fixed cost, marshaling creates additional overhead. There is no marshaling cost between blittable types that have the same representation in managed and unmanaged code. For example, there is no cost to translate between int and Int32.\r\n>\r\n> For better performance, have fewer PInvoke calls that marshal as much data as possible, instead of more calls that marshal less data per call.",
