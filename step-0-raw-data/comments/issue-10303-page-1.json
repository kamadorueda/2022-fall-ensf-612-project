The following example demonstrates that and also shows that there already _are_ situations where you can use such types - with casts and implicit conversions (whereas you cannot use them with `Get-Member` and static member access (e.g., `[Tst]::foo`)):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Define a rogue enum \r\nAdd-Type @'\r\npublic enum Tst {\r\n  Foo = 5,\r\n  foo = 1   // !! case variation with a distinct value\r\n}\r\n'@\r\n\r\n# Note: The `* -1` is just a quick way to show the numeric value.\r\n[Tst] 'foo' * -1 # -> -1 !! case-exact match found specific value\r\n[Tst] 'Foo' * -1 # -> -5 !! case-exact match found specific value\r\n[Tst] 'fOo' * -1 # -> -1 - case-inexact match defaults to *numerically lowest* entry.\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoes that ever happen in the wild? It certainly sounds ill-advised.\r\n\r\nThe question is whether retaining an explicit check and exception for this particular corner case is worth it / is feasible performance-wise.",

Most of those, if PowerShell follows them at all, it's incidentally.  Others aren't checked at all.\r\n\r\nThere are also some additional guidelines in the [Common Language Specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/12a7a7h3(v=vs.100)) docs page.  At a glance, one that stands out is this:\r\n\r\n> The .NET Framework class library includes types that correspond to the primitive data types that compilers use.\r\n>\r\n> Of these types, the following are CLSCompliant: Byte, Int16, Int32,Int64, Single, Double, Boolean, Char, Decimal, IntPtr, and String. For more information about these types, see the table of types in the .NET Framework Class Library.\r\n\r\nThere are even classes in SMA that violate this rule.  Here's some classes that have either public properties or parameters of type `uint`.\r\n\r\n```raw\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.DeserializingTypeConverter\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.InformationRecord\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.CustomItemFrame\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.WideControl\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.Runspaces.TypeData\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RemotingInformationRecord\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.ChildItemCmdletProviderIntrinsics\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.PSPrimitiveDictionary\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.CustomEntryBuilder\r\n```\r\n\r\nCLS compliance is **not** a reason to throw here.",

    "body": "Good point, @daxian-dbw.\r\n\r\nLet me **summarize the current - inconsistent - behavior** (as of v7.0.0-preview.3), which may inform the way forward:\r\n\r\n* **_Methods_** that are case variations of each other (e.g, `method` and `Method`) are **quietly accepted and only ONE variation takes effect**.\r\n    * Since the order of member enumeration is not guaranteed by the reflection APIs, **it is undefined which method \"wins\".**\r\n* **_Properties_** and **_fields_** cause an explicit error message, making the **type unusable**.\r\n    * The **only - limited - exception** are **`System.Enum`-derived types**, where case variations _can_ be used, but **ONLY IF**: \r\n        * You **use only _casts_** to access the values; e.g., `[MyEnum] 'foo'` rather than static property access `[MyEnum]::foo` - however, the instance `.value__` property can be accessed on a cast value (e.g., `([MyEnum] 'foo').value__`)\r\n        * Unlike with methods:\r\n            * **ALL case variations are accessible by cast _if specified case-exactly_.**\r\n            * **Otherwise**, it is **seemingly the _numerically lowest_ value** among the case variants that is returned.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI see three ways forward:\r\n\r\n* (a) To avoid the problem altogether, _categorically_ prevent types with members whose names differ only by case; that is, also prevent those cases where such types can currently be used. (Of course, this could be a backward-compatibility concern.)\r\n\r\n* (b) Use the \"you're on your own\" philosophy already being employed  by _method_ case variations also for properties and fields:\r\n     * _One_ definition will win, but it's undefined which one that is.\r\n     * If you need predictable, case-exact access, use reflection (e.g., `$obj.GetType().GetMethod('method').Invoke($obj, @())`)\r\n\r\n* (c) Do extra work and impose _case-sensitive lexical_ ordering when PowerShell caches the members, and _predictably_ choose the one that comes first based on that order (irrespective of what case variation the user specifies _at runtime_).\r\n  * Again, users can use reflection for access to the \"eclipsed\" case variations.\r\n\r\nOnly (b) and (c) would allow use of such \"rogue\" types, and making them usable - even with _documented_ limitations - seems preferable to me.\r\n\r\n(c) is the most user-friendly option; the extra work incurred shouldn't generally impact performance, as needing to deal with case variations - hidden behind already extant conditionals - will be the exception, not the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
