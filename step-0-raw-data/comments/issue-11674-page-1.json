    "body": "Thanks @mklement0! Copying my comment here so I can mark the one in the other thread as off topic. \r\n\r\n> While I agree that adding an `ObsoleteAttribute` would be annoying and probably not what we want here, I strongly disagree that it would be a breaking change.\r\n> \r\n> If adding `ObsoleteAttribute` to anything is a breaking change, then that attribute is pointless. \r\n\r\nIt definitely *can* break things (I know there is a difference between something breaking the change contract and a change technically breaking a thing, but bear with me):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-Something {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    end {\r\n        if ($theWorldIsEnding) {\r\n            $PSCmdlet.WriteWarning('some bad stuff is happening')\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is part of why I don't really like the warning system at all.  Most of the things I would want to warn about are better off as a non-terminating error anyway.\r\n\r\nIf something is writing a warning, I'm either silencing it, or throwing on it.  If I'm throwing on it with `-WarningAction Stop`, then adding `ObsoleteAttribute` will cause my script to always throw.\r\n\r\nI know that if it's considered a breaking change than that makes the attribute useless, but that's how it feels currently. Personally I think `ObsoleteAttribute` should be moved to a design time warning only, *maybe* with `error: true` being the exception.  That's how C# works as well, anything already built keeps on chugging but you're gonna know about it if you try to use it in something new.\r\n\r\n> The whole idea of attributes is that they behave as additive metadata.\r\n\r\nThat's true up until the point where something reads that metadata and changes behavior based on it. Adding `Mandatory` to a `ParameterAttribute` for example is for sure a breaking change.",

I've supported many breaking changes in the past and will continue to do so - when the benefit outweighs the risk.\r\n\r\nYou could argue (and I'd find it hard to disagree) that the risk is pretty small for adding a warning.  That said, it's often discussed as zero risk, like it's an interactive only change. The risk is definitely higher than zero, and in my opinion higher than should be acceptable for the simple act of marking something as obsolete.  I'm mainly suggesting that a design time warning should be sufficient.",

Sometimes it seems to me that it has no design at all :-). Since PowerShell merges everything into one output stream, this will always be a problem, regardless of whether there are warnings. This mechanism is, by definition, completely unreliable. \r\nOpposite look SC Orchestrator. It doesn't use external process, it hosts PowerShell and as result has not the issue.\r\n\r\nNow we should look how deprecation is used. We have 2 main scenario - user console session and application session (I mean all without user interaction).\r\nAs user I'd accept informational messages that a cmdlet or feature will be removed from future version as non-secure (Invoke-Expression) or non-supported (Send-MailMessage).\r\nBut it is important that the message offers a replacement (link to docs) otherwise it will useless and annoying. User will switch to proposed alternative and will do not get warnings.\r\n\r\nFor applications the warnings are pointless. Main concern in the discussion is that warnings can break something. I believe we are thinking not in right direction because besides this minimal risk there are many, many changes that represent a real risk.\r\nRunning blindly any script, module or application on new PowerShell version is dangerous and may be destructively. Users should test their scripts in sandbox before run in live business environment.\r\nRight direction is that we should protect users and enforce them to test scripts.\r\nProposal is to introduce _PowerShell adoption mode_ to prevent users from running non-tested scripts.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Some thoughts I want to throw carelessly into the ether:\r\n\r\n- There are different reasons to deprecate things and different conceptual degrees of deprecation. But adding granularity there is sure to be complex and confusing, so perhaps it's best to just establish a bar for deprecation and a single process for marking something as deprecated\r\n- We should distinguish between opinion on style, invocations that are error prone but valid, invocations that are very likely to be dangerous and finally APIs that it's recommended to move off of or for which support is not continuing\r\n- In that final case, there have been APIs that have been removed without deprecation (like the WMI cmdlets or the win event cmdlets). In some cases there might be little or no opportunity to go through a deprecation process (where a Windows or .NET API is what has changed), but this might be a good opportunity to work out if we could be more consistent on this\r\n- If we decide that there should be an online deprecation register or similar, it might be make sense to formally deprecate some of the APIs that no longer appear in 7\r\n\r\nI think @mklement0 enumerated the options for deprecation well (but everyone please feel free to add new ideas for communicating deprecation). Two thoughts on that:\r\n\r\n- PSScriptAnalyzer, while owned by the PowerShell team, is a very community-driven tool. Most of its rules have been written with or guided by community input, and I wouldn't say they have an *official* capacity. That is to say, if we want PSSA to be a deprecation vector, I would suggest we create a new namespace for \"official\" deprecation rules. I say this since some rules have a style opinion, and the PowerShell team tries not to prescribe styles too much (at least not in my time).\r\n- As I touched on in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11662#issuecomment-577818647, we've had trouble articulating the concept of \"deprecation\" to users and a document describing what that means both generally and for PowerShell specifically should probably be a deliverable here.\r\n\r\nSo in terms of what it would take to resolve this issue in my mind, I would list the following:\r\n\r\n- Written dev process on deprecating a PowerShell feature/API (that is, a guide on how to implement the deprecation of a feature)\r\n- Documentation of the concept of deprecation and the deprecation process in the docs repo, as well as possible ways to ignore deprecation if needed\r\n- Any needed updates to currently deprecated features' documentation\r\n- Possibly a list of examples of reasons for deprecation, without trying to be prescriptive about criteria",

    "body": "re: terminology\r\nIn this context, can we define `obsolete` and `deprecated`? There appears to be some confusion (e.g. the first comment uses obsolete/deprecated interchangeably which is very confusing).\r\n\r\nre: signaling deprecation/obsolescence \r\nI think it makes sense to think about how this is handled elsewhere. Let's look at Win32 APIs. Those APIs—some [deprecated](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/desktop/legacy/jj635743(v=vs.85))—certainly don't function differently in an attempt to signal lifecycle status/policy to the user. This ensures maximum app compatibility until the very last moment. The working assumption here is that the user is aware of the API's lifecycle via other side channels (e.g. docs, blogs, tooling warnings and errors, crashes, etc).\r\n\r\n❌ I **do not** support the emission of any data to any stream (e.g. screen, file, network) at runtime to signal intent. This will break apps.\r\n\r\n✔ I **do** support updates to dev tooling and docs to communicate this class of information prior to making changes.\r\n\r\nPowerShell Core follows the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy), which requires upgrades after 6 months (and patch installs after 30 days). The vehicle for these Cmdlet changes is already in place and active. Use it!\r\n\r\nWindows PowerShell instead falls back onto the OS lifecycle. Want a stable platform for your scripts to run for years unimpeded? Use a long-term servicing branch of Windows and Windows PowerShell.",

    "body": "> Add a rule to PSSA that checks for said attribute\r\n\r\nThe issue I see here is that this relies on the PowerShell version analysing the script (which is something I don't like about PSSA in general). Perhaps that's not the end of the world, or even a good thing in this case. But my preference would be for PSSA to have a catalogue of deprecated invocations and us keeping that up to date.\r\n\r\n> Let's look at Win32 APIs\r\n\r\nThose are very low level APIs; there's really no mechanism to decorate them for deprecation (at least not one that wouldn't slow some APIs down by orders or magnitude). Conversely, the .NET APIs, which PowerShell is more directly built on, emit compile-time warnings for every static use of an API with an `ObsoleteAttribute` on it.\r\n\r\nI don't like emitting warnings at runtime for deprecated APIs though. PowerShell's \"compile time\" is essentially at runtime (or at least, isn't dependable enough a stage to put warnings at). I still don't fully agree with the breaking argument -- warnings are differentiated from errors in that they are ignorable (open the dev console in any webpage and see how many warnings show up), they are also configurable and redirectable, `ObsoleteAttribute`s have emitted warnings for some time in PowerShell, and other data streams get used in the background by PowerShell all the time. However, emitting warnings at runtime for this is both ugly and inefficient (since every invocation must look for `ObsoleteAttribute`s).\r\n\r\nI'm also wary that most users aren't using PSScriptAnalyzer or really all that much in the way of tooling. But I suspect that tooling and documentation is the best answer we have here. To get to that point though, PSSA is going to need some investment, both in terms of making it a better tool (which is planned to be worked on but will take time and could always use help) and also in terms of helping PowerShell users discover, configure and use it.\r\n\r\nI also suspect that in documentation, we should have a one-stop-shop for enumerating deprecated APIs so that they are really discoverable.\r\n\r\nAlso, nobody's said otherwise, but I feel like I should add that in terms of SDK/development experience, the `ObsoleteAttribute` is still useful (arguably more so) to let module/host authors know what APIs are deprecated.",

Getting past runtime warnings here is hard. A possible alternative *might* be in PSReadLine (like if it coloured deprecated commands differently or put a warning in the completion info section), but that's really spitballing.\r\n\r\nThe other problem with not emitting runtime warnings is that statically analysing for deprecated invocations isn't always possible. It's entirely possible to use a deprecated API in a way that a tool analysing the AST (be it PSSA or PSReadLine) wouldn't pick up (but which the engine always catches).",

In places like reddit and Twitter, users still ask about PSSnapIns and WMI cmdlets in the context of PowerShell 7 &mdash; communicating obsolescence is hard.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/platform-compat\">dotnet/platform-compat</a></strong></div><div>Roslyn analyzer that finds usages of APIs that will throw PlatformNotSupportedException on certain platforms. - dotnet/platform-compat</div></blockquote>",

    "body": "@rjmholt, re `3>$null` / `-WarningAction SilentlyContinue`: I think the point is that **warnings shouldn't suddenly start showing up in deployed code** written _before_ a feature became obsolete.\r\n\r\n@FireInWinter, re:\r\n> I'm for never showing a message interactively.\r\n\r\nI can't speak to the technical feasibility (@SeeminglyScience has hinted at a solution), but to me it makes sense to **show the warning in _direct_ interactive use (only)**, e.g., if you submit\r\n`'foo' | Format-Hex -Raw` _directly at the prompt_ - as opposed to doing it _inside a script_. This would alert _non-scripters_ to the deprecation as well, and alert scripters early.\r\n\r\nTo turn the warning off, you could use \r\n`$PSDefaultParameterValues.Add('Format-Hex:WarningAction', 'SilentlyContinue')` (though note that it will silence _all_ potential warnings emitted by the cmdlet).\r\n\r\nAs @rjmholt notes, without a compilation step we cannot really ensure that scripters will see the warning, but being vocal about the recommended tooling (PSSA, directly or implicitly via VSCode) would help.\r\n\r\nOf course, someone who only ever invokes _scripts_ / module functions / cmdlets would then never get to see the warnings, but I think it's fair to expect scripters (command authors) to take responsibility for deploying updated commands that avoid the deprecated features.\r\n\r\nThis **could be complemented with an _opt-in_ mechanism (preference variable) to _always_ show deprecation warnings at runtime**, which would address @KevinMarquette's scenario, though not by default; similarly, it addresses the limitations of _static_ analysis that PSSA can provide, as noted by @rjmholt.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, a **centralized online deprecation \"registry\"**, as mentioned by @rjmholt, sounds like a great idea, especially for the wholesale removals / fundamental breaking changes mentioned by @joeyaiello , such as the removal of workflows and the change in default character encoding.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRe **terminology**:\r\n\r\nWhile not really formalized, **the term _deprecated_ - not _obsolete_ - has historically been used in PowerShell** (e.g., for the `ModuleToProcess` module-manifest entry), _generally_ with the \"soft\" meaning outlined in the OP: \r\n * not recommended for use anymore, but won't be removed \r\n\r\n_Why_ it is not recommended anymore, which could be one of several reasons, should be detailed in the specific _messages_ - as I agree with @rjmholt that trying to formalize _degrees_ of deprecation would introduce too much complexity; as @joeyaiello and @rjmholt have noted, some features effectively _have_ gone away, notably in the transition to PS Core, but that's the exception, from what I understand. \r\n\r\nUse of the `ObsoleteAttribute` .NET attribute is an _implementation detail_, whose terminology happens not to align with PowerShell's; _publicly_, these terms shouldn't be mixed - **only _deprecated_ should be used**, which means that the boilerplate part of  deprecation warnings shouldn't say \"is _obsolete_\"  - it should say \"is _deprecated_\", which requires changing the `UseOfDeprecatedCommandWarning` and `UseOfDeprecatedParameterWarning` messages (others?)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

    "body": "For the author, we could make a message visible with `-Debug` messages, `Set-StrictMode` latest make its usage an error, PSScriptAnalyzer issue a warning or error, call it out in the documentation, and have the PowerShell team blog it. `Test-ModuleManifest`,`Publish-Module`, and `Publish-PSResource` throw errors with an switch to bypass. PSGallery can send notifications to module authors. Issue warning in `Install-Module` or `Install-PSResource` when a module is installed. Optionally `Import-Module` can issue a warning on import.\r\n\r\nFor the consumer, for the first major version after it's actually gone, throw a specific error to communicate why their script is broken instead of the standard parse error. This also helps authors that run preview versions to discover it early.\r\n\r\nIf all that doesn't get the authors attention, then it's unlikely they would have changed it before it breaks. We can't say we didn't give our best effort.\r\n\r\nAs far as implementation details, having an attribute that can be used on functions, parameters, variables, classes (and their methods and properties) that's available in script modules gives authors the ability to utilize this feature. It would be good if the attribute on the functions,classes, (or modules?) can specify properties and members that have been removed. \r\n\r\nI prefer the attributes but as an alternate implementation, use something in the module manifest to indicate what's on the way out or already gone so it's handled appropriately and gives other authors a single place to look in a module to see all these settings in one place.  This would help `PowerShellGet` integration into the notification effort.",

I was very convinced by @BrucePay's argument offline that we really *can't* ever remove anything from PS7 given it's LTS nature and stability long-term. \r\n\r\nOne idea I had today (inspired by some of @JamesWTruher's suggestions) is that we could create a parallel to experimental features called \"deprecated features\". They'd be on by default to keep breaking changes from occurring, but with Get/Enable/Disable-DeprecatedFeature sets, you'd get:\r\n* queryability of deprecation\r\n* opportunity to be strict in your own environment by disabling deprecated features\r\n* context on how to address the deprecation (similar to how rule documentation works in PSSA)\r\n* (potentially) generating the warning (or deprecation) stream messages\r\n  * similarly, users could suppress these messages from a Enable-Disable-DeprecatedFeatureMessage cmdlet)\r\n* (potentially) giving hooks to module authors to centralize and message their deprecations\r\n\r\nI'm planning on writing up a specific issue for just this idea, but I wanted to float it here first to move the ball forward on getting it shot down ;) \r\n",

Deprecation is just a warning system, and it might warn about breaking changes or it might warn about other things.\r\n\r\nI think to break things the right way, we need:\r\n\r\n- A way to phase out/in APIs\r\n- A system for keeping breaking changes in the right branch and in only the right releases\r\n- A process to identify whether a breaking change should be taken, and if so what next milestone it should appear in\r\n\r\nToday we don't really have any of these, other than possibly experimental features for the first, and I think it would require a fair amount of work to get them. If we decided to take it on, we'd need to find the time to invest in it.\r\n\r\nI should also say that on the edge of development there is always a bias for moving forward, but as a shell, a programming language and a platform, PowerShell needs to be mindful of the full lifecycle of changes it introduces, and should look around to see how other software we compare ourselves to behaves. How often and in what way does bash, zsh, C#, .NET or Python take a breaking change?\r\n\r\nAs @joeyaiello says though, conversation about breaking things should be moved to a new issue.

If a Deprecated Feature is disabled, then it should throw an exception (instead of being hidden).\r\n- We should have warnings and telemetry when a Deprecated Feature is used, this will help determine if a Deprecated feature can ever be removed (default is to never remove a feature as we don't have usage data today)\r\n- For .NET APIs that are obsolete, we can also prevent usage if disallowed if called by scripts\r\n\r\nWe believe this feature requires a RFC to be authored",
