My comments are guarded toward this idea moving into the mainstream of scripts that we write or compatibility layers we might create to make scripts multi-platformable.\r\n\r\nAlso, at the Vista/Windows 7 timeframe special folders received a new API upgrade to \"SHGetKnownFolderPath\" which is more abstract and OEM extensible legacy \"SHGetFolderPath\" in that it uses GUIDs for the folder IDs.  \"SHGetFolderPath\" used more human friendly constants.  If SHGetKnownFolderPath was picked it may hamper support on pre-Vista kernels.  But maybe .NET Core does it differently than either of these APIs?\r\n\r\nI'm not personally losing any sleep over lacking support for OSes before Windows 7 - but only Microsoft knows the global customer implications of such choices.\r\n",
