It would be great if it could be right in the EXEs like you all did with openssh.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I was working on the ability for the openssh package to probe for which exe to use for the DefaultShell.  By the time I got it done, I realized I would need to make sure they can only choose an EXE and should not be allowed to have any wildcards in the file name so that they are always going for a know file name and don't pickup unintention EXEs.\r\n\r\nJust wanted to give light to a use case where having it actually in the exe is not only what is generally expected on Windows - in this case it avoids custom code to go find the version for an EXE by looking in a DLL.\r\n\r\nIs it somehow more challenging to do it for powershell than it was for openssh?",
