I've seen a fair few odd things squirreled away there, and it's just a hashtable really, so unless you already know where it is (i.e., it's well-documented in an appropriate place), I don't think we should expect users to know exactly where to find prerelease data.\r\n\r\nOf course, this would  be a non-issue if module manifests just supported SemVer properly, but we've had the SemVer talk pretty recently - #2983 was recently resurfaced and we're still waiting on the CoreFX team to get that sorted, really.\r\n\r\nAlso, I tend to dislike the formatter showing properties that \"aren't really there\" or are buried several levels deep, unless it's just rendering the data that _is_ there in a way that is really only useful for formatting. If we're showing it off, it should be reasonably readily accessible, not 3 levels deep -- in my opinion. ðŸ™‚ ",

    "body": "`PrivateData` exists specifically because the structure is not enforced.  Currently, psd1 files are strictly validated with the exception of `PrivateData`.  This enables backwards compatibility.  I think we should seriously consider making psd1 loosely validated so we can add actual new members without worry about breaking compat.  However, that also means that it only works with that version going forward (modules authors may not like limiting their audience so adoption of such a thing would be low until most users move to that version of PS).\r\n\r\nThere are already many cases where formatting shows \"phantom properties\" or renames properties to make them better viewed on the console, but the actual property name is something else.  One thing we could do is have some formatting to make those members more obvious that they aren't actually part of the object.",
