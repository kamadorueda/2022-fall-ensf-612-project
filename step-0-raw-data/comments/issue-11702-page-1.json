This is because replacement expressions can contain tokens such as `$1`, which would be replaced with the contents of a match group from the match pattern.\r\n\r\nSee here for a list of supported regular expression tokens and in which cases they can apply: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference\n\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/regular-expression-language-quick-reference\">Regular Expression Language - Quick Reference</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
