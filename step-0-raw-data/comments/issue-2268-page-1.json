    "body": "Intriguing, but the syntax indeed needs rescuing from obscurity: neither `Get-Help about_Variables` nor `Get-Help about_Scopes` mention it.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, given that it still works on Windows, it should work on Unix too, which appears not be the case as of v6-alpha16:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> Set-Location $HOME; ${/:foo.txt} = 'bar'\r\nAccess to the path '/:foo.txt' is denied.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that using `/:` as the namespace modifier is the analog to how the feature works on Windows: you use the _name of a PowerShell drive_ as the prefix. (More on that below.)\r\n\r\n@lzybkr: That's why ` ${.\\foo.txt}` in your snippet doesn't actually create a file, but creates a regular variable literally named `.\\foo.txt`, so your performance comparison doesn't apply (its results are surprising, but that's a moot point); try `${.\\foo.txt} = 'bar'; Get-Variable '.\\foo.txt'`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell in Action, 2nd Edition book calls the feature _namespace variable notation_ and explains it as follows (emphasis added):\r\n\r\n> Along with the scope modifiers, the **namespace notation lets you get at any of the resources surfaced in PowerShell as drives.** For example, to get at the environment variables, you use the env namespace:\r\n> [...]\r\n> Using variable notation to access a file can be startling at first, but it’s a logical consequence of the unified data model in PowerShell. **Because things like variables and functions are available as drives, things such as drives are also available using the variable notation. In effect, this is an application of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.** Each type of data store (file system, variables, Registry, and so forth) is a “model.” The PowerShell provider infrastructure acts as the controller, and there are (by default) two views: the “file system” navigation view and the variable view. The user is free to choose and use the view most suitable to the task at hand.\r\n\r\nThis tells us that expression such as `$env:PATH` are an application of this technique - and probably the only application that is widely in use, without general awareness of the underlying mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn practice, as of v5.1, only the following drive providers support namespace notation:\r\n\r\n* `Environment (Env:)`\r\n* `Function (Function:)`\r\n* `Alias (Alias:)`\r\n* `FileSystem (C:, ...)`\r\n* `Variable (variable:)`  - though virtually pointless, given that omitting the namespace accesses variables by default\r\n\r\nNotably, the following standard providers do not, with PowerShell complaining about `IContentCmdletProvider` not being implemented: `Registry`, `Certificate`, `WSMan`.\r\n\r\nThat is, only those providers that support the `IContentCmdletProvider` interface, i.e., getting and setting an item's _content_, (implicitly) support namespace variable notation ; e.g.:\r\n\r\n* `$env:HOME` is the same as `Get-Content env:HOME`\r\n* `$env:foo = 'bar'` is the same as `Set-Content env:foo bar`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPerhaps another interesting application is in-place updating of files - all operations happen in-memory, and the original file is directly updated, but note that _the default encoding is invariably applied_:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n${c:foo.txt} = 'hi'        # Write to file foo.txt.\r\n${c:foo.txt} = ${c:foo.txt} -replace 'i', '@' # Update foo.txt *in place*\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to the noted inability to control the character encoding when writing to files with namespace notation, namespace notation's general limitation of only supporting _literal_ paths means that you're limited to targeting files with literal names / paths - either relative to the current location or with absolute paths.\r\n",
