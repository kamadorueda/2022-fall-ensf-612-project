Therefore, this applies only to _file_ paths (because we already do the right thing for _directories_), as follows:\r\n\r\n* for _literal_ paths _in full_ (e.g., `c:\\windows\\odbc.ini` should return `[System.IO.FileInfo]` instance with `.FullName` `C:\\Windows\\ODBC.INI`); that is, all path components need to be corrected.\r\n\r\n* for _wildcard-based_ paths, only if the wildcard pattern is limited to the _file-name_ (leaf) component; e.g., `Get-Item c:\\windows\\odbc.in*` reports `c:\\windows\\ODBC.INI`, i.e. only the _file name_ case-exactly. (By contrast, if the wildcard is (also) in a _parent_ path component, things already work as expected; e.g., `Get-Item c:\\window*\\odbc.in` -> `C:\\Windows\\ODBC.INI`).\r\n\r\n(As stated, we already do this for `[System.IO.DirectoryInfo]`, and as such using something like `Get-ChildItem <dir>`  -even with `Recurse`  - automatically gives us case-exact `[System.IO.FileInfo]` instances already.)\r\n\r\nNotably, **determining the case-exact name is _not_ necessary as part of the path normalizations we seemingly _always_ perform**.\r\nThat is,  something like `Get-Content c:\\windows\\odbc.ini` does _not_ need to care that the case-exact form of this file's path is `C:\\Windows\\ODBC.INI` - all that matters here is that the file can be _located_ for reading its contents.\r\n\r\n",
