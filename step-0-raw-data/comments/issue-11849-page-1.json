    "body": "Well, on your first snapshot you are getting this error during yum update, so I don't see any link to powershell here. Try to install something else, like java, to see if you getting this error. Also, try to reproduce it  installing centos container or VM on your local machine. Probably centos8 is just too heavy for 1GB machine. Keep increasing memory. Other option - download powershell binaries instead of installing it.",
