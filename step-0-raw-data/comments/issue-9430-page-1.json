PowerShell, due to the exact file-path match (curiously only with _absolute_ paths) thinks that the companion file rather than the executable one is to be opened, and hands the companion-file path to `ShellExecute`, which invariably executes in a _new_ window but _does_ execute the `.cmd` file, after all.\r\n\r\nThat is, in the absence of a filename extension in the specified path, the Windows shell  (`ShellExecute`) prioritizes _executables_ over _documents_.\r\n(The question then arises how to instruct `ShellExecute` _not_ to look for a file with an executable extension and use the path verbatim in order to open the companion file - at least I _hope_ that is possible.)\r\n\r\nPowerShell should do the same, which in the presence of `.` in `$env:PATHEXT` would mean _not_ passing the file path to `ShellExecute` and attempt direct execution in the _current_ console window, as would happen for, say, a `.py` file.\r\n(I can't tell whether there are any technical challenges.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
