    "body": "> A message to the verbose stream is already being issued (but only in PS Core); i.e., you need to use -Verbose to see it\r\n\r\n@mklement0 I didn't know the verbose message was already there. I agree that's sufficient.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if we are all clear on the current behavior as demonstrated in the repro steps:\r\n```\r\nAdd-Type -TypeDefinition @'\r\n  public class Foo {}\r\n'@\r\n  \r\n# Try to redefine the type with different source code.\r\nAdd-Type -TypeDefinition @'\r\n  public class Foo { public int Bar {get {return 42;} } }\r\n'@\r\n```\r\nToday, the second `Add-Type` actually generates another assembly with the type `Foo` that contains a `Bar` property. However, the use of `[Foo]` subsequently will have undefined behavior -- it could be resolved to either the first `[Foo]` that has an empty body, or the second `[Foo]` with a `Bar` property, because the type resolution will stop after finding the first `Foo` from all loaded assemblies. See the example below:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> $as =[System.AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() | ? -not Location | select -Last 2\r\n> $as.FullName\r\n0pyel1t2.h2v, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\r\nbycuxatk.jhq, Version=0.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null\r\n\r\n> $as[0].GetTypes()\r\n\r\nIsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType\r\n-------- -------- ----                                     --------\r\nTrue     False    Foo                                      System.Object\r\n\r\n> $as[1].GetTypes()\r\n\r\nIsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType\r\n-------- -------- ----                                     --------\r\nTrue     False    Foo                                      System.Object\r\n```\r\n@iSazonov I don't think this is the right behavior for `Add-Type`, because there is no way for the user to reliably use the generated type. I think we should fix it to throw error when redefining the same type with different source code.",
