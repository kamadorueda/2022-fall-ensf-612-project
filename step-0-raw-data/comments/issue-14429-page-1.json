This is a lot less controversial than some of the others, if one dislikes it, change the accent colour, if one wants to go mad with it, change the accent colour :-)  \r\n \r\nUnderline for headers is worth considering (but green does it quite nicely. )   I'd also suggest looking at whether ----- should be as wide as the label, or run the full width of the column. Underline probably only goes as far as the text.. \r\n",

We can see how it is changed in your video so it's reasonably clear that the white on blue was a user choice - and users can pick what works for them (even if others hate it). Personally I'd have bold labels and one colour.  Provided it redirects without escape codes of course :-) ",

For tables, I'm ok with a separate member that can be customized, but perhaps have it the same color by default.  Since this is now under `$PSStyle.Formatting`, I think just calling it `TableHeader` would be concise and don't need the word `Format` in it at all.",
