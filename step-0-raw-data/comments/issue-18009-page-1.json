    "body": "@iSazonov Thanks for explanation, I was not aware of this. From what I saw, `Test-Json` can be easily migrated as it pretty much just forwards strings or filenames for JSON and its schema. Other cmdlets might be more difficult, but `Test-Json` is the only one that uses JSON schema and returns just true or false, so I see no downside in swapping to a better provider immediately.",
