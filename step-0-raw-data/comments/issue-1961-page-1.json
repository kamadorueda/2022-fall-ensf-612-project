I'm unable to find a document that will take me all the way to this goal.\n\nSo far, I've installed powershell, which works but I can't install packages.  Then I install nuget, which requires mono.  I've installed both those.  But powershell can't use nuget to get anything without further configuration or something I'm missing.  Is there any guidance to get someone up and running quickly without them having first to learn _everything_?\n",
