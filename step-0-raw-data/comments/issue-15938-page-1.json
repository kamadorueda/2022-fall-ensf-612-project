It is not security hole but it is change current practice how we delegate management permissions.\r\nCode signing is not protect us. Thus trojans broadly use Winternal utils to do bad actions (psexec can copy an application to remote host, SDelete cfn wipe).\r\n\r\nI have no strong objections from the feature but nervous. :-)",
