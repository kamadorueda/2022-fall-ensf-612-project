So, that change was made to work around the default keyword filtering on Unix. Looking back at that change, it's not well thought through as it basically cancels the default keyword filtering.\r\n\r\nI think the root problems are:\r\n1. what level of parity should the logging on Unix has compared with on Windows? For example, an event with the keyword `UseAlwaysAnalytic` can be written to ETW by default. Does that make sense? Should the logging on Unix be able to do that by default as well?\r\n2. we need to review the code that issues events. Are they using the correct keyword and channel? For example, I see calls like `PSEtwLog.LogOperationalVerbose(..., PSKeyword.UseAlwaysAnalytic, ...)` where operational channel is used but the pass-in keyword is \"PSKeyword.UseAlwaysAnalytic\".",

    "body": "The windows implementation is based on a misunderstanding of how channels and keywords are used. Under the hood, channels and keywords are simply bits in a larger bit set and enabling/disabling a given bit does not cause the event to be written.  What causes it to be written is one or more listeners that have compatible bit set for the given event.  If no listeners have requested events with the analytic bit set, they are dropped on the floor.\r\n\r\nNormally, this is handled completely transparently to the component raising the events, the underlying event descriptor indicates what keywords are defined for each event and has a bit set for the target channel.  \r\n\r\nProblems occur when attempting to customize this behavior. In this case, stripping the analytic bit from all events mean all analytic events get logged.\r\n\r\nAs far as #2 above, that code really doesn't make sense from an ETW standpoint. Events are expected to target a single channel, not changed on the fly and in your example, under the hood it is targeting multiple channels since both operational and analytic are marked (one via LogOperationAlVerbose and a second via PSKeyword.UseAlwaysAnalytic).\r\n\r\nAn alternative solution would be to log 'required' script block events to operational (perhaps as warning) and leave the remaining marked as analytic and don't attempt to mix and match keywords and channels on the fly; it usually ends up causing unexpected results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

All other values, including keywords, channel, opcode, task and level are  embedded in the event descriptor.  It's not clear to me why the original PowerShell code base decided to also pass these values as explicit parameters. At best, it's passing redundant values, at worse, the events that are logged do not always match the definition in the manifest.  \r\n\r\nPowerShell usually gets away with it more as a side-effect of how consuming code usually decodes events but it also means cases where precise queries are needed may not return the complete results since the logged events do not match the events declared in the manifest.  However, if the consuming code uses the manifest as the authority, events may be presented incorrectly. For example, if the manifest indicates an event has an Informational level but the event was logged as Error level, the event would be presented as Informational.\r\n\r\nIf we end up doing the work to decouple PowerShell's logging from ETW, this will have to be refactored out of the callers and will like require an updated, and simpler, ETW manifest when used on Windows.",
