    "body": "Hi @mklement0  Here's what's happening. The `exit` keyword throws a special exception to indicate that the engine is exiting. As currently implemented, this exception is being caught by the implementation of `PSScriptMethod` in  `PSScriptMethod.Invoke()` and wrapped in a `MethodInvocationException`. Looking at the inner exception, you'll see the original exception:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS[1] (41) > $e.Exception.InnerException.GetType()\r\n\r\nIsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType\r\n-------- -------- ----                                     --------\r\nTrue     False    ExitException                            System.Management.Automation.FlowControlException\r\n\r\nPS[1] (42) >\r\n```\r\nIIRC this rather interesting exception handling strategy was done so that you could use script methods in F&O without worrying about infinite recursion if a method used in formatting errors had an error.",
