    "body": "AFAIK `Delete(true)` does the same thing, it calls `Dir.EnumerateFileSystemEntries` and it itself will traverse down and delete the files before it deletes the actual parent dir The difference is that PowerShell adds a few more checks in there to handle things like like OneDrive reparse points, or broken symlinks, that I believe .NET struggled with in the past. Maybe that's no longer an issue and it could be simplified as you are suggesting. Even if it can't be simplified and there is another reason for PowerShell to enumerate and delete the contents itself then the fact that `$dir.Delete($true)` works means there's a bug in the logic here which should be fixed.",
