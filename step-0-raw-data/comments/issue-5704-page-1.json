    "body": "@MuraAtVwnet Not all of `System.Drawing` has been implimented in .NET Core. You can see what is currently available in that namespace [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing?view=netcore-2.0).  `System.Drawing.Bitmap` is not currently available specifically. More may be added later.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use any of the classes that are currently available in `System.Drawing`, you will need to use the [Windows Compatibility Pack](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/11/16/announcing-the-windows-compatibility-pack-for-net-core/). You can easily add this with the following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInstall-Module PSCoreWindowsCompat -Scope CurrentUser\r\nImport-Module PSCoreWindowsCompat\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is currently only supported on 64-bit Windows.\r\n\r\nFor clarity, these are missing in PowerShell because they are not yet available in .NET Core. When and if they become available in .NET Core, they can be used in PowerShell.",
