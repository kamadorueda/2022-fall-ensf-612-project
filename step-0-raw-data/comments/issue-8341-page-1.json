    "body": "@iSazonov Reply to your comment here:\r\n\r\n> > More work will be done to further bring down the jitting time at startup.\r\n>\r\n> Do you continue in the PR?\r\n\r\nNo, that will be in a new PR. The planned work are as follows:\r\n- Generate PDB for crossgen'ed assemblies that can be used by PerfView/WPA, so that I can do further stack analysis on CPU time.\r\n- Crossgen'ed assemblies still leave a high cost of jitting time comparing with ngen. It's probably by design as ngen is targeting a specific CPU while crossgen is targeting a general x64 architecture, but I need to contact .NET Core team to get better understanding and see if there are other options (profile-guided-opt?)\r\n- Ad-hoc code changes to avoid unnecessary work at startup time.\r\n\r\n> I don't see Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.dll in the table - no jitting?\r\n\r\nAfter the change, no IL code needs to be jitted for this dll at startup time.\r\n\r\n> Do we really need types from the dll in CorePsTypeCatalog.cs? We could remove 239 lines.\r\n\r\nYes we do. Type conversion depends on the type catalog. Not all .NET Core assemblies shipped with PS Core are loaded at startup. Today, user can use a type even it's from an assembly that is not loaded yet, because powershell knows which assembly the type is from by looking in the type catalog. Without it, the user needs to know which assembly the type is in, and then load the assembly first before using the type. The type catalog is also used in tab completion, so that powershell can tab complete types that are not loaded yet.\r\n\r\n> The dll is used for telemetry. Do we really need load the dll at startup? Seems we could delay the telemetry\r\n\r\nApplicationInsight telemetry is done in console.dll at startup, as long as the user hasn't opted out.\r\n\r\n> The telemetry is a static class. We have other static classes. I guess some static classes is initialized at startup (I guess they is initialized at first use time) - does this slow down startup? Make sense to analyze this and try to delay static classes initializations?\r\n\r\nThe work that is done in this PR are based on the analysis of Reference Set and Jitting time. Some ad-hoc analysis on the static members might be useful, but I think our efforts should be guided by the measurement data, so our time can be spent on things that matters most.\r\n\r\n> If ReadOnlyHashSet was rewrited I think we could look other classes used in PowerShell Core engine. Maybe it won't speed up the startup but increase performance.\r\n\r\nThe reason to change `ImmutableHashSet` to `ReadOnlyHashSet` is because this only use of `ImmutableHashSet` causes `System.Collections.Immutable.dll` to be loaded at startup, which brings in 74 pages loaded from disk. This shows up as part of the reference set analysis. It might be useful to look at other classes, but again, I think our efforts should be guided by the measurement data.\r\n\r\n> having Outliers it is not good in the test - seems interference from other processes.\r\n\r\nThere is no interference from other pwsh processes when running the tests. `BenchmarkDotNet` starts each process many times, and sometimes there are outliers.\r\n\r\n> I think that an ordinary user computer is 2 physical cores and it would be correct to limit the test to two physical cores. (This may be related to tied compilation)\r\n\r\nThe baseline is the same, and here we care most about the percentage of improvement instead of the actual startup time. As for multi-core background jitting, with changes in this PR, only `20.5ms` are spent in the multi-core background jitting, very small number comparatively, so I don't think it has noticeable effect on the improvement percentage.\r\n",

Only \"Type conversion depends on the type catalog\" prevents us from removing the dll from TypeCatalog?\r\n\r\nNot sure what you mean by \"But the dll is loaded at startup\". Most of the assemblies included in the type catalog file are not loaded at startup.\r\n\r\nEven for the dlls that are loaded at startup, type resolution would be much faster for a type from those dlls because we can avoid the effort to search types from all loaded assemblies to find the one.\r\n\r\n> I understand. My request is - Does the telemetry delay startup or no? If yes we could postpone the telemetry call and loading the dll.\r\n\r\nThe telemetry definitely play a role in the startup time, but I don't know how much after crossgen'ing the dll because I'm not able to analyze the stack info in PerfView/WPA with crossgen'ed assemblies yet.\r\n\r\n> I think these outlies is important to investigate in the startup context.\r\n\r\nEvery run of the test starts those processes many times for measurement, including the warm-up. Not every test has outliers in it. I think it's more related to the factors that is out of our control, such as the OS.\r\n\r\nBTW, I replaced the detailed test record with a most recent run (after `2nd attempt to address comment` commit). You can see that there is only 1 outlier and it's for measuring pwsh 6.1.",

    "body": "@lzybkr @PaulHigin @TravisEz13 Can you please look at the new changes to `PerformSecurityChecks()` in `CompiledScriptBlock.cs` ?\r\n\r\nMajor change is on how we decide to skip AMSI/malicious code scan. The previous way to check for skipping `.psd1` files causes security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nAn attacker can put arbitrary content in a `.psd1` file, and call `[Parser]::ParseFile()` to get an AST from the `.psd1` file. Then the attacker can create a script block from the Ast by calling `$myAst.GetScriptBlock()`. That script block then will be considered from a `.psd1` file and skip the code scan.\r\n\r\nThe skip-scan condition is changed to:\r\n- the script block should come from a .psd1 file\r\n- the script block is in fact a HashtableAst\r\n- the HashtableAst is safe, by calling `IsSafeValueVisitor.IsAstSafe(hashtableAst, GetSafeValueVisitor.SafeValueContext.Default)`.\r\n\r\nThe API `IsSafeValueVisitor.IsAstSafe` has been used in `GetSafeValueVisitor.GetSafeValue`, which is used in module script analysis code, `Import-PowerShellDataFile`, and the public API `Ast.SafeGetValue()`.",

    "body": "Yeah, it looks so to me. The average startup time improvement compared with PS Core 6.1 drops to `24.5%` in my tests with changes in the master branch. It's a `1.5%` drop on average comparing with before my changing to `IsSafeAst`. I have updated the number and the example test record in the PR description.\r\n\r\nIt's the price for security, I guess :/ But I think we can possibly further improve it by having an internal overload of `IsSafeAst`. The current `IsSafeAst` always creates a new instance of `IsSafeValueVisitor`, but in this case here, we should reuse the same instance instead of creating a new object every time, which might add GC pressure given how frequently this method will be called. But doing this shouldn't help much on the startup time as we only call this method once during the startup `pwsh -noprofile -c echo 1`. I will pursue this lead in my follow-up PRs, which will be out soon.",

My comment above:\r\n> In fact, we come from one point - ScriptBlock.CreateDelayParsedScriptBlock(\"string\", isProductCode: true).\r\nI don't review in depth but I don't found the pattern \"isProductCode: false\". Perhaps we could implement separate code path.\r\n\r\n2. We have some frozen PRs from @powercode which can increase overall performance and speed up startup too.\r\n\r\n3.
