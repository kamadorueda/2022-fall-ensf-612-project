    "body": "Access control would be better implemented through the root cause.  If you don't want a file deleted, protect it with File ACL.   Don't want them to edit the registry, use a registry ACL.  Don't want them to access the internet via Invoke-WebRequest, use a firewall with ACL.   If they write a cryptomining program in PowerShell, then control their access to the CPU/GPU to contain their access to the CPU resources required to have a meaningful output.  Last but not least, if a malicious script could be developed, antivirus software would be just as affective at stopping script execution.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, nothing is going to stop a user who can type a math problem in at the command line, from pasting script and executing it, providing they can get the text of a malicious script past the antivirus in the first place, to get it in their copy paste buffer.\r\n\r\nDoes the same fear exist for CMD.EXE (or is this a Linux control issue?)\r\n",
