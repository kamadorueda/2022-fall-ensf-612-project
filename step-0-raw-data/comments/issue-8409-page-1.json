    "body": "FF_MODERN is a property of the font family, which describes the \"look\" of the font in general terms. It means the font has a non-variable stroke width. Most (but not all) fixed-width fonts are also modern.  [see docs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc250389.aspx)\r\n\r\nYou _can_ set your console font to *any* font (including non-fixed width fonts) _via the API_. I don't recommend using non-fixed-width fonts, because they break anything like `Format-Table` 😉 \r\n\r\nYou can use my [WindowsConsoleFonts](https://github.com/Jaykul/WindowsConsoleFonts) module to set fonts that don't show up in the property dialog, if you want to -- or to see what sorts of contortions you'll need to [figure out](https://github.com/Jaykul/WindowsConsoleFonts/blob/master/Source/Assembly/FontHelper.cs#L86-L100) to do it yourself.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that:\r\n\r\nThe Chinese characters in the output of your `Get-ItemProperty` are the names of the fonts that you should use if you want to see the characters 😉 -- probably DoumChe and GulimChe (Korean), MingLiU, NSimSun, SimSun-ExtB (Chinese). They're all FF_MODERN | FF_ROMAN fonts (or at least, they claim to be) and are usable in the console through the regular property dialog. They support a lot more extended characters (basically just Chinese).\r\n\r\nConsolas also has a full set of Light, Heavy, and Double box characters. It doesn't have any support for Chinese, Japanese or Korean...\r\n\r\nHowever, if you have an East Asian environment chosen in Windows, there are [additional caveats](https://superuser.com/questions/583835/adding-microsoft-console-cmd-font-in-registry-does-not-work-with-eastern-asian)\r\n\r\nHowever, I have to agree with @E3V3A on this: PowerShell is responsible for the default font choice. It choses the \"Lucida Console\" font, even when the conhost default is \"Consolas\" ... The font is stored _in the shortcut_ **and** the registry_, 😒 along with the color scheme 😡\r\n\r\nHowever, the notion that we should use a unifont by default is preposterous. Unifonts (Asian fonts, in general) are **HUGE** and most people can't actually read every language script anyway. The original GNU Unifont is about 11,998KB of font -- some of the Microsoft East Asian fonts mentioned above are as large as 30,409KB -- while Consolas is about 1,693KB\r\n\r\nP.S. If you want to use a unifont, pick one that's _merged_ with a decent console font, like [this one, merged with DejaVu Sans](http://ilyaz.org/software/fonts). If you don't need all that, you can [try NerdFonts](https://nerdfonts.com/) which adds vector icons to fixed-width fonts...\r\n\r\n",

So my choice of glyph above, is outside the [IBM 437 OEM_CHARSET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_437), so if I had used another box from that page, it would have worked with any console font. However, one always wonder why not more glyphs...\r\n\r\nThe thing that is still an unknown, is the definition of the statement `constant stroke width`. What does that really mean?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I really appreciate your effort in trying to help here. :) However, I don't think there is much more to be done about this issue until this ConPty stuff actually get more stable and implemented widely. The other mega issue is how color and color-escape codes are handled on different terminals.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it would have been **nice** is pwsh console would just allow you to select whatever font yo have, that is compatible, so user doesn't have to bother with all these registry hacks etc, and thanks @Jaykul for trying to simplify that issue with your tool, but yet to be tried.
