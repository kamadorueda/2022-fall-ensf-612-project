As Paul's comment linked to above explains the code has always followed an incorrect path and it appears  it was intended that `-sshs` should carry an implicit `NoProfile` but this has never been done.\r\n\r\n",

There are two things with PSSessions   \r\n \r\n1.  A PSSession over WSMan _does not_ process the profile. The command to start pwsh in an ssh _subsystem_ \r\n    `Subsystem\tpowershell\tc:/progra~1/powershell/7/pwsh.exe -sshs  ...` does.  \r\n2. Any output form subsystem at start up seems to cause an error\r\n\r\nI think (2) is expected with openssh -if  you don't specify `-NoLogo`  in the subsystem you get an error citing the the PowerShell version message (The way I have installed 7.3 preview means I can't test on that - the help I linked to above says the `-NoLogo` isn't needed in 7.3, so this symptom may have been silently fixed) \r\n \r\nBut (1)...  PSSessions should do the same things regardless of the connection mechanism.  But the `-sshs` switch doesn't do that automatically and causes `-NoProfile` to be ignored  unless someone tells me that has also changed for 7.3\r\n\r\nIt seems that if the user is a member of admins,  ssh connections are always as admin.  Since I'm testing on my local machine I'm using `New-PSSession  -EnableNetworkAccess -ComputerName localhost` for winrm, and I think that inherits the token from the current session because if I connect from PowerShell run as admin, my PSSession returns true for\r\n`[System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent().Groups.Value -contains 'S-1-5-32-544'` and if I run from PowerShell un-elevated, it returns false.  AIUI this is specific to  `-EnableNetworkAccess` not to winrm so the *should* in \"PSSessions should do the same things regardless of the connection mechanism.\"  is not a *must*\r\n",

    "body": "This won't be a problem with OpenSSH itself. When you use pwsh remoting over SSH the subsystem line is essentially the command that OpenSSH spawns when a new subsystem is requested. This process then uses the stdout/stdin to communicate the XML payloads needed for PSRemoting to work. If your profile runs and outputs anything on the console that could interfere with these payloads you get this problem. What should really happen is that either `-sshs` also implied `-NoProfile` (what I would expect and keeps it in line with WSMan) or makes sure that when `-sshs` is run then nothing else can write to the console to interfere with the PSRemoting communication.",
