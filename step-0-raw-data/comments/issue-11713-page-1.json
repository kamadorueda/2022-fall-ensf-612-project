Otherwise, they will throw exception which [got swollen silently](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/11713/commits/b6b446a9a3895ea292837019d3914cb70d722127#diff-62032daf278902e44b9c801a37a8ec81R1299) by `KillServerProcess()` (by design), and thus the line [`_serverProcess.Kill()`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/11713/commits/b6b446a9a3895ea292837019d3914cb70d722127#diff-62032daf278902e44b9c801a37a8ec81R1280) will never be executed, which causes the child process started by `Start-Job` lingers around forever.\r\n\r\nThe issue results in 34 child pwsh processes not cleaned up after the jobs finish, which eat up the memory in the Windows CI environment. That's why we see the `stack overflow` and out-of-memory error thrown from CoreCLR (`Failed to create CoreCLR, HRESULT: 0x8007000E`).\r\n\r\n@PaulHigin @iSazonov Can you please take another look at the changes? Thank you!",
