CDXML modules can be slow to load and the generated code feels quite bloated. For example the `Storage` modules takes 2s to load on my machine and generates nearly 40,000 lines of PowerShell.",

It's different from the cache for command discovery. The latter only contains metadata information (which command name belongs to which module), but no code for execution. I don't recommend to do it -- it's not an urgent thing that needs to be mitigated with a workaround. If we want to invest in this area, then we should directly improve the `ScriptWriter` and works on the tool that produces assemblies from CDXML files.",
