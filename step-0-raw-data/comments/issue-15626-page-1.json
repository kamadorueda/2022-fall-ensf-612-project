As I understand it, the OS reads those registry values on startup (for machine-scope variables) and on login (for user-scope variables), but does not monitor them continually. I'm sure there are ways to update the user scope variables on the fly, but I think doing so requires a p/invoke call as well as the registry change -- I think .NET normally handles that when you call SetEnvironmentVariable() with the appropriate parameters to set the variables at the proper scopes.",
