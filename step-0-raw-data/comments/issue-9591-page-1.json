    "body": "It's not so much that PS continues on when unhandled exceptions occur... it's that many commands _explicity elect_ to output a **non-terminating** error for non-serious scenarios. For example, if a particular object coming from pipeline input is mangled / unusable, a non-terminating error is usually written, allowing the rest of the probably OK data to be processed. If instead a specific non-pipelined parameter value is unusable, the error is usually considered terminating as the command cannot reliably process any input.\r\n\r\nStrict Mode shouldn't have any bearing on this behaviour, in my opinion, and should remain a separate setting.",

I think my big concern is I would advocate any style guide do max strict mode and \"ErrorActionPreference\" = \"Stop\" and I think all my coworkers agree. So having them separate settings seems bad since it makes it easy for people who want both to be unaware of one.",
