    "body": "@MartinSGill With all due respect to the resource you provided, it's clear the author of the answer is not a lawyer either.\n\nWhile I can't find any credible discussion to mirror this scenario exactly, I offer this discussion by attorneys about as to what happens when there are conflicting clauses in an agreement: http://law.stackexchange.com/questions/2263/what-happens-if-two-clauses-in-a-contract-come-into-conflict\n\nThe [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License) itself does not have the conflicting \"all rights reserved\" phrasing. It was added to the license in this repo by the creator of the `LICENSE.txt` file (perhaps unknowingly).\n\nTo be fair, the [BSD License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses) does include the phrase \"all rights reserved.\" However, the [ISC License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license), the [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), and the [Apache License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) do not.\n\nSo while the phrase being included in the BSD license does set precedent for the conflicting terms, \"all rights reserved\" is certainly not a part of the MIT License. It seems this license is a hybrid of the MIT and BSD.\n\nEven if the owner of this repo decides to keep the license as-is (which I personally think is the wrong thing to do, but it's not my decision), I don't think it's fair to say PowerShell is licensed under the MIT license if it's not actually using the MIT License.\n",

As far as I'm concerned, Microsoft may modify the license if it so desires.\n\nI would respectfully suggest modifying the README.md file in this repo to make it clear the license is a \"slightly modified\" MIT license, or perhaps (since the license is so short) to simply incorporate the whole license under the Licensing heading and foregoing any reference to the MIT License. This isn't a deal breaker for me either. I just think it would be the most accurate way to represent the license.\n\nThanks for your consideration and your patience.\n",

    "body": "@joeyaiello : fwiw, I don't think that WebRTC calls its license \"MIT\" or \"BSD\". I /think/ the license itself is basically BSD w/ the reservation you're using, but in my quick search, MIT doesn't appear anywhere relating to the license. And where it does mention \"BSD\", it says \"like most BSD licenses\" instead of saying \"this is under the BSD license\".\n\nhttps://webrtc.org/faq/#what-does-this-license-let-me-do\n\n> Like most BSD licenses, this license allows you to use the WebRTC code with a minimum of restrictions on your use. You can use the code in proprietary software as well as open source software.\n\nNote: These comments don't mean that I object to the license, I'm just wearing a very detailed oriented hat for the moment.\n",
