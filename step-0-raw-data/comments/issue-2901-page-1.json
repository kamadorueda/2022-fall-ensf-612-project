    "body": "@alx9r I understand your frustration.  The situation is that although PowerShell is OSS, Windows certainly is not.  Windows servicing (which is what I was referring to) is a long process because app-compat is a top priority for Windows so each servicing fix goes through rigorous validation across all of Windows (which is a pretty big organization and product).  At this time, the expectation is that only critical fixes go back to PowerShell 5.x (this means security issues and any approved fixes that have gone through Microsft customer support channels).  Our team's focus is on PowerShell Core 6.0.\r\n\r\nThe release notes of [WMF5.1](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2016/12/06/wmf-5-1-releasing-january-2017/) should include all notable fixes.  Unfortunately, I can't be more specific about Windows servicing releases.",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT Thank you for the clear statement.  Understanding what to expect helps a great deal to make good decisions at my end.\r\n\r\n#2505 affects the development pace of PowerShell modules containing classes.  It looks like #2505 is improved (at least partly) in 6.0-alpha.14, but that release is affected by #2902 which seems to preclude its use for the development of DSC resources.  I'm hoping for a release where DSC and the reloading of modules containing classes both work.  I understand that this might be asking too much, but can you provide any guidance on when I could expect such a release?",
