    "body": "WG-Engine discussed this today (5/12/2022).\r\n\r\nWe agree having the ability to customise this in $PSStyle makes a lot of sense. Our opinion is that limiting this just for customising MatchInfo itself is probably a bit too narrow-scoped given the general scope of $PSStyle, but it does seem to be the correct place to put this kind of customisation.\r\n\r\nAs a result, our suggestion is that:\r\n\r\n- $PSStyle should be augmented to include a setting for `TextEmphasis` which can be customised by users\r\n- The default value for this property should match the current formatting sequence for MatchInfo emphasis\r\n- MatchInfo's formatting should be updated to use the formatting sequence from $PSStyle in its formatting to permit the customisations from users to take effect there.\r\n\r\nIt is well within the realm of possibility that other cmdlets, even community modules, would be able to make use of this emphasis and get by default a level of customisability from this kind of change, which we think would be valuable.\r\n\r\nHowever, the PowerShell team may not currently have the resources to take on the implementation of this change directly. As such, we've marked it Up for Grabs and would be more than happy to accept a contribution for this change if interested parties are willing to look at making the changes themselves. 🙂 \r\n\r\n/ccing @SteveL-MSFT here as well as it falls under some of the code he's most familiar with and he may be able to provide more specific pointers on implementation details.
