    "body": "WMF 5.1 **does not apply to, and cannot be installed on Win10**. Each WMF package targets specific older versions of Windows. WMF takes the latest version of the management stack and updates older versions of the operating system's PowerShell, WMI, & WinRM components. \r\nWin10/Server 2016 are maintained via Windows Update. If you want to update earlier version of Win10 to the latest PowerShell/WMI/WinRm features, use WU to get the latest update of Win10. If you modify the in-box version of PowerShell/WMI/WinRM, you should be able to do a system repair to get back to the original components.\r\nI believe this is nearly duplicated in the [WMF blog topic]\r\n(https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2016/12/06/wmf-5-1-releasing-january-2017/). \r\n",
