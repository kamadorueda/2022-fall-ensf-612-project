    "body": "Yeah - this would be a really  big breaking change. PowerShell is an expression oriented language. A literal value (string, number or whatever) is simply echoed to the output. If you want to execute an arbitrary value, then you must prefix it with '&' (the call operator). This addresses a variety of scenarios: executing entities having invalid characters in their names,  scripblocks, commandinfos,  and module specific command names.  Remote contexts where considered but never, unfortunately, implemented. Changing the requirement for '&' is unlikely however there may at be things we can do from a  pedagogical perspective that would help (new) users.",
