The system for display UI like the progress banner doesn't emit to a stream, it writes to the raw console buffer. This might interfere with OSC sequences.\r\n2. If there isn't already, there should be a central API in the ConsoleHost for emitting raw OSC sequences like this. I might have to investigate how `pwsh` handles color codes on non-windows systems and see if something like this exists. I don't want to bury code emitting OSC to a stream in the actual progress UI code.\r\n",
