If PS Core uses case-insensitive module names, what should `Import-Module foo` do in this scenario?  Perhaps it should error indicating multiple module names that vary only by case is not allowed (and is just dumb in the first place)?

The behaviour that is correct is that of the remove-module command. What if modules and scripts were to come from devices other than those exposed by filesystemprovider? Let's say, on an embedded powershell, where instead there's a solidstatestorageprovider or something. (This is something I tried to raise a conversation about a few years ago on PSMVP: Why aren't we using the IContentReader indirection to source scripts and modules? I get it that the reason is about performance and it seems like overarchitecting to wrap streams in that interface, but I digress...  )\n",

    "body": "I believe that as a general principle, PowerShell should be as case-preserving/case insensitive as possible while not breaking the underlying OS.\n\nSo in the case of the Unix File system manipulation and environmental variables - these directly affect the underlying OS and integration with other tools so we have to be case sensitive.\n\nIn the case of PowerShell variable names - there is no interaction between them and the underlying OS so we should be case insensitive.\n\nSo then issue with Module Names is that they are a tweener.  On the one hand there is a strong mapping to an underlying OS - a foldername.  On the other hand, theyy refer to a pure PowerShell concept - a PowerShell Module.   So you could argue it either way.\n\nTo me, the thing that pushes this decisively to the Case Insensitive solution is the effect the issue has on Ecosystem sharing.  If module names are case sensitive in Unix, then Tom might publish Module TEST and Mary might publish Module test.  But then if a Windows users tries to use both these modules, they are going to collide and they fail.   \n\nI'm going to propose an acid test we need to apply:  Does case sensitivity break sharing artifacts between Windows and Linux?    If the answer is yes, then the prima facia answer should be that we should be case insensitive.\n\nErgo - Module names should be case insensitive. \n\nDoes that sound right?\n",
