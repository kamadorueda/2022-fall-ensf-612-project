There was an older [commit](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/3349f84ed0c75f37c013d8683d5bdb5a47887db5) to determine the security zone on Core and if the UNC share has a dot in the name (like `\\\\foo.bar.com\\share` or `\\\\1.2.3.4\\share`) then it is treated as internet, otherwise intranet.  If intranet, the file is treated as local.  In @weloytty's repro above, it appears the UNC path has periods in it, so the code thinks it's internet which causes loading to fail (unless signed).  I suppose one option is to resolve the computer name to see if it's in the same subnet, but then it can get complicated and still not work for all cases.",

Dots in the name or the lack there of is not a perfect indication is the host is an internet or intranet host (you can fully qualify an intranet address or add an internet domain to your search list).  \r\n1. As others have mentioned, the alternate data stream can be tampered with (PowerShell has the `unblock-file` cmdlet).\r\n1. As far as subnet numbering RFCs, yes private subnets are intranets, but you also may be connected to a random hotspot which should not be trusted.\r\n1. Finally, it is not designed to stop users or automation that is trying to bypass the policy.\r\n",

Please let me know if a new issue should be created for this since this is now is PS v7 (and not PS v6 as referenced in #7458 and #8298).\r\n\r\nEven though the FQDN server name from where the files are being run from is explicitly added to the Local Intranet zone, scripts are not allowed to run the FQDN server name.  Per the [about_Execution_Policies for PS v7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7) documentation, if the Execution Policy is set to **Unrestricted** it:\r\n\r\n> Warns the user before running scripts and configuration files that are not from the local intranet zone\r\n\r\nSince the FQDN server name is explicitly added into the Local Intranet zone, I expected that PS v7 would allow scripts to run from this FQDN Local Intranet location, as it did in PS v5.1.\r\n\r\nThis also means that for environments where folder redirection is used where the Documents folder is redirected to a FQDN path, PS v7's $Profile script is affected by this also each time PS 7 starts.\r\n\r\nFrom [the previous comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7458#issuecomment-452249172), it appears that enabling the following settings worked:\r\n\r\n- Intranet Sites: Include all local (intranet) sites not listed in other zones\r\n- Intranet Sites: Include all network paths (UNCs)\" helped\r\n\r\nHowever, this was already set for me, and this problem persists in PS v7.  Here are my current settings:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9782485/77875798-035cb900-7206-11ea-8156-c805313c5503.png)\r\n\r\nI can confirm that setting the ExecutionPolicy to **Bypass** does not experience this problem.  \r\n\r\nNote that while signing may be an option for general scenarios, we have users who develop scripts from within their Documents folder (redirected to a FQDN server path so it is backed up), and we need to account for these types of scenarios too.\r\n\r\nMy goal is to not allow scripts to run from anywhere (ExecutionPolicy=Bypass), but rather only from trusted locations that have been specified in the Local Intranet zone (ExecutionPolicy=Unrestricted).  This will be needed before we can deploy out PS v7 to our environment.  How can we configure this in PS v7?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Note that I still expect the default Restricted mode to not allow paths from FQDN paths, even if they are in the Local Intranet zone.\r\n\r\nIn PS7, what is the difference between Unrestricted mode and Bypass mode when it comes to FQDN paths (since the [PS7 documentation on this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7) doesn't appear to be accurate)?  \r\n\r\nThanks!",

That clears up why IE isn't being referenced anymore in PS Core aka PS v7.\r\n\r\nCan we enhance the code to determine the zone of a host?  For instance, at a minimum, could the system domain membership's FQDN domain path be considered \"local\" or \"trusted\"?  That would cover at least the domain's Netlogon folder on the domain's FQDN path.  Is there some other mechanism where we can inject using \"trusted locations\" that we used to be able to do via IE's Local Intranet zone?  We'll need a way to add paths via Group Policy on Windows too.  Ideally we'd like to avoid setting all of our systems to \"Bypass\" since that seems more open than we'd prefer, and would like to be able to specify specific trusted folders where it does not present the additional security prompt.  This would help domain administrators from a security perspective too.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

As one of the IT admins, I'd like to still make it harder for my users to run a script from any random UNC path.  But I would like them to be able to run scripts from their Documents folder, as well as have a PowerShell profile that works as it did before where it doesn't present a security warning.

Not so we have to rewrite it in 7.2.\r\n\r\nI may be assuming incorrectly here, but even if IE isn't installed, Windows still references and uses these settings for Windows Explorer.  For instance if you open a file from a FQDN path, and that path is not in the Local Intranet zone, it gives you some extra warnings when opening Office files.  After we add the Windows domain FQDN paths to the Local Intranet zone, it corrects that problem, and files from the FQDN UNC paths open as expected in Windows Explorer with no warnings.  I haven't tested removing IE, but I assume this will need to continue to work since even though the Local Intranet settings are accessible from within IE, they apply in other areas of Windows too.\r\n\r\nIf my understanding is incorrect about this changing when IE is removed, please let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Group Policy support will help IT admins significantly, and help improve adoption of PSv7.\r\n\r\nSo that I understand this better, would these trusted remote systems be defined using the DNS name only, or would we also need to specify the entire path?
