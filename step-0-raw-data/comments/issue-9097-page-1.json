    "body": "A couple thoughts:\r\n- The reasoning for using a comment for a directive was probably because of the low usage of the keyword.  In most languages, a keyword must be reserved in its entirety, and in this case, to only one purpose.  Using a comment marker eliminates that need to reserve the word from any other use.\r\n- A second reason, is that, new concepts can be added without breaking backwards compatibility when they serve minor value.  Not saying that's what is going on here, but another valid reason they exist.  Thinking of it that way, comment based directives should really only be considered minor, which is not really what `requires` does, except that if the `requires` directive is skipped, eventually an error will occur.   Its just that by then, the damage might already have been done.  A properly written program would have damage control.  In this case, `requires` could be just a easy way out of writing damage control.\r\n- My main concern, is that there is a lack of a requirement for a delimiter between the keyword and its arguments, and further agitated that the example of a seemingly valid construct for an argument is not accepted without a delimiter, when in fact one is not required for the keyword itself. ie `#requires-modules psworkflow` still returns an error, while anywhere else in PowerShell, the token would been decoded as  `requires-modules` and that wouldn't match `requires`.  I unfortunately do not have enough experience with other languages that do this (commented directives) to know how they behave, but the behavior seems odd.\r\n- `using`s requirement to be the first line(s) is solution to the reservation of a keyword, albeit with its own restrictions.  `using namespace` could just as well as been a comment directive, as its not critical (it just makes the writer type longer name spaces).\r\n\r\nIn actuality, most of the work of `using` or `#requires` can be accomplished directly in the scripting language, where more specific error messages could be crafted, or even the issue worked around, maybe with the exception of importing classes from a module.\r\n\r\nI can implement the current syntax in the tmlanguage grammar, it will just be the odd one out, in all the rules, and is why I bring this up.  I think its better to have a good understanding of the grammar than to just assume it works a certain way, hence my investigation in to it in the first place.",
