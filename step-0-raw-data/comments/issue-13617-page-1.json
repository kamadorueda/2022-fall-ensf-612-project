    "body": "@PaulHigin can correct me if I'm wrong here but as I understand it the issue with PSRemoting, what `Enter-PSSession` uses, is it uses an SSH subsystem that exchange bytes back and forth between the client and server. This subsystem is started based on the command specified in your `sshd_config`\r\n\r\n> Subsystem powershell c:/progra~1/powershell/7/pwsh.exe -sshs -NoLogo\r\n\r\nBasically when sshd gets a request to connect to the `powershell` subsystem it will start a new process based on that config entry and use the stdio pipes for that ssh connection as the new process' SSH pipes. That means your ssh session's stdout is the same pipe that is attached to `pwsh.exe -sshd -NoLogo`. From there any data sent from the PowerShell client is sent over the stdin pipe to pwsh and any data received is from the pwsh stdout pipe. This data is encapsulated in a simple XML message like\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Data Stream='Default' PSGuid='00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'>PSRP fragment(s)</Data>\r\n```\r\n\r\nAny messages exchanged between the client and the server are all in these XML messages, that's unlike a normal ssh session where you've simply reading and writing to the stdout/stdin like a normal process. So if you tried to nest an SSH connection that had interactive input then PowerShell would need a way to read and write to those new pipes in a way that didn't affect the PSRP data exchanges.",
