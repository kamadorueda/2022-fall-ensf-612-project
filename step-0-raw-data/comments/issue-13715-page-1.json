    "body": "So. I can code in many languages, but I haven't used C# in ages other than using .Net classes in a PowerShell module I am building for my colleagues and I at work. I was going to ask if you knew of an simple open source app I could use to test with but decided to go down another route....\r\n\r\nAfter spending too long searching online for how to set the a programs DPI Awareness property and not coming up with anything concrete in PowerShell, using CIM classes, etc..  I checked the **pwsh.exe DPI Awareness in Task Manager** and it was also Unaware. The problem wasn't occurring before so I think I inadvertently changed it when messing with Soap UI (related to the module that I am building), Java versions and .bat files that don't play well with HiDPI displays. I am moving more and more to working predominantly from the shell in Windows (very good thing) so I was running everything in the shell.\r\n\r\nI ran the **Troubleshooter on pwsh.exe and got it to change its DPI Awareness to Per Monitor**. Now, apps started with Start-Process are appearing as they should, so closing the issue. Sorry to waste your time, but thanks a million for the assist.\r\n\r\nI would still like to know how to mess with the DPI Awareness or get to the property programmatically though... ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
