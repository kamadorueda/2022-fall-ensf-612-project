If a robust solution can be found to that issue (see #7999; there is also some relevant discussion in #7399), it would become trivial to incorporate the solution into the behaviour of this feature as well.\r\n\r\nIdeally the functionality of this feature should match the behaviour of wildcard globbing as implemented in provider cmdlets.\r\n\r\nGiven that, we don't think this specific issue makes sense to fix in isolation, and it would be likely to result in additional confusion when such a workaround would subsequently fail to work with wildcards in other areas of pwsh.",

    "body": "Just to note an important distinction, @vexx32:\r\n\r\n* #7999 is about how _cmdlets / providers_ treat wildcard expressions that they see _after_ the parameter binder has bound arguments. That is, `Get-Item *`, ``Get-Item `*`` (the bareword parsing eats the `` ` ``), `Get-Item '*'`, and `Get-Item \"*\"` are - and should be - equivalent, because `Get-Item` sees verbatim `*` in all cases.\r\n\r\n* By contrast, we're talking about an _intentional anomaly when calling external programs on Unix_, in service of emulating a different shell's behavior: as in POSIX-compatible shells, what matters is whether the argument is _quoted_ / has _individual metacharacters escaped_ (e.g., _from Bash_, compare `echo *` with `echo \\*` / `echo '*'` / `echo \"*\"`), in which case _no_ globbing must be applied. \r\n  * Therefore, the solution must be implemented at the level of the code that parses the raw argument and decides whether native globbing is to be performed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Yeah, I'd agree that the code path here is somewhat separate to the one originally mentioned in #7999. However, the problem is likely caused by similar handling of input -- both use WildcardPattern -- and I think we were all more or less in agreement that it would counterintuitive to implement a partial fix that only addresses this issue instead of generalising the fix to also resolve the original issue for #7999.\r\n\r\nI think it's definitely worth mentioning that in #7999 and we can incorporate this facet into the original issue as well. 🙂 \r\n",
