    "body": "@sdwheeler This PR #13353 has tests to verify if the help system is properly identifying if a cmdlet has this attribute or not. To verify I had added the attribute to the correct parameters I used a PS script to gather the globbing value from the help system. If external help is present it uses what you put in the maml. I compared the output to your list and caught a couple of extra parameters. As for ensuring that the attribute is added on new parameters and cmdlets I'm not sure about the best way to do that.\r\n\r\n@vexx32 had an idea to remove the need to have this attribute at all in #4715. If it was the pre-1.0 days to have parameters use `WildcardPattern` as the parameter type. As a related suggestion we could have a generic type of `[Wildcard<T>]` so the module author can indicate at the type level if wildcards are supported. The generic type could have properties/methods that wrap or use `WildcardPattern` to validate `IsMatch()`. There are a couple of examples in the PS code where the input type of a wildcard parameter is not a string. Those cases use an argument transform attribute.",
