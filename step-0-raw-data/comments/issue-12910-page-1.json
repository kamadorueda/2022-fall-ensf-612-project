    "body": "PowerShell Core does not have its own `Resolve-DnsName` cmdlet yet. It gets this cmdlet from the DnsClient module of Windows PowerShell. AFAIK, the module is not open source. In Windows, [DnsQueryEx](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/api/windns/nf-windns-dnsqueryex) lets the caller specify the DNS servers, but I suspect that doing so may disable DNS over HTTP for that query.\r\n\r\nIn <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6076#issuecomment-465324287>, it was suggested that a cross-platform `Resolve-DnsName` cmdlet could be implemented for PowerShell Core by using [DnsClient.NET](https://dnsclient.michaco.net). The current version of DnsClient.NET sends its DNS queries using [UdpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.udpclient?view=netstandard-2.0) or [TcpClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.net.sockets.tcpclient?view=netstandard-2.0) instead of using the Windows DNS functions, so it would not be affected by the `EnableAutoDoh` setting of Windows.",

    "body": "@KalleOlaviNiemitalo, Thank you for the explanation of the underlying issues. Of course, it is early days for DoH support in Windows so it will be interesting to see if the issues you mentioned get resolved so that Resolve-DNSName can reliably implement DOH as well\r\n\r\nI think that a client platform-level implementation of DoH should be as secure as the HTTPS in its name implies by preventing unintentional or inconsistent unencrypted DNS traffic. Until that happens, I'll keep using a third-party tool like DNSCrypt-proxy or YogaDNS.",
