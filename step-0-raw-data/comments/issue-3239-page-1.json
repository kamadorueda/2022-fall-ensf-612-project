    "body": "@lzybkr:\r\n\r\nCryptic in homeopathic doses is healthy: \r\n\r\nPowerShell is commendably not cryptic overall, but in some cases offers cryptic syntax as a concise _alternative_ (you still can be verbose if desired) for _frequently used_ constructs, notably `?` for `Where-Object` and `%` for `ForEach-Object`.\r\n\r\nProviding `$x ? $y : $z` as a concise alternative to `if ($x) then { $y } else { $z }` to me is in the same spirit.\r\n\r\nThe cryptic aspect is ameliorated by `?` being reminiscent of a _question_ and therefore suggesting a conditional (albeit one _preceding_ the `?` in this case), and - more importantly - being _a potentially familiar construct from several other languages_, with the same fundamental semantics.\r\n\r\nYou don't get the same benefit with `$x -then $y -else $z`: it is not familiar.\r\n\r\nAlso, while many PS operators do have symbolic names, many do not: `* / + % ...`\r\nThese are inherently cryptic too, we just don't perceive them that way anymore, because they are so familiar and ubiquitous.\r\n\r\nMy sense is that  `$x ? $y : $z` too is already familiar to many, and will become even more so once introduced into the language, given the frequent need for concise conditionals.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

There's no requirement to use these \"advanced\" features and if a programmer can't read the code because they lack the experience, then personally that's my cue that I need to learn something new really quick.  \r\nWhen I first saw a ternary in C# I was like WTF is this fresh hell MS has introduced, until I took a few minutes to read up on this, which then I was hooked.\r\n\r\nPractical example in POSH, I have this line:\r\n`$mc_object = ($Message.fields | where Name -Match appname).Content`\r\nwhich is fine and dandy except when the $Message object does not have a filed property that has a name of \"app name\", and since I don't control the JSON formatted data this comes from, I have to determine what to do.\r\n\r\nSo with a null-coalesce operations all I have to do is add `?? \"\"` at the end to make sure that the $mc_object always was a valid string, even if the original setter was null.  Otherwise, I would have to do some different techniques to accomplish what 4 keystrokes can do, such as \r\n`$mc_object = if(-not ($Message.fields | where Name -Match appname).Content)){\"\"}else{($Message.fields | where Name -Match appname).Content}`\r\nThat to me is very unreadable, but then I can clean this up a little bit by doing something like this, which is what I am doing.\r\n`$mc_object = ($Message.fields | where Name -Match appname).Content\r\nif(-not $mc_object){$mc_object = \"\"}`\r\n\r\nWhile not terrible, it's a heck of a lot more than 4 keys being pressed to null-coelasce.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I definitely vote for ternary and null-coelasce in Powershell, it adds some very advanced features and just makes Powershell more compelling to use in the \"core\" form on any system.",

Operators are entirely different.\n\nI think you'll find that the *vast majority* of operators used in PowerShell to be quite different from their C# equivalents. The PS team have very clearly opted for a more descriptive syntax for the majority of the operators.\n\nI would consider that ternary behaviour should *also* take after the more verbose syntax options available. PowerShell may have been conceived as an 'on-ramp' to C#, but that does not mean it should inherit its more symbolic syntaxes. Indeed, there are many places where that has been painstakingly *avoided*.\n\nConsider, if you would, that your arguments for the symbolic syntax are rooted in *how other common programming languages* represent this concept. PowerShell has *not* been one to go that route in the post, instead preferring to work with as descriptive a syntax as can be made sensible. Merely because those of use who already have experience in C# are familiar with such syntax is *assuredly not* a reason to use it.\n\nIf PowerShell is an 'on-ramp' language to C# or any other language (which, I feel, it does fairly well at this far) then we *need* to consider the lowest common denominator here and think about what the most inexperienced persons would find *sensible* and *intuitive*.\n\nI'm not saying my proffered solutions are *it*, but I think they're possibly headed in a more sensible direction from this perspective.",

    "body": "@lzybkr:\r\n\r\n> Specifically, the ternary operator exists because C/C# are statement oriented languages but needed conditional expressions.\r\n\r\nWell, in PowerShell flow-control statements such as `if` are _half_-expressions; in _simple_ expressions, the proposed ternary operation would be equivalent; in _nested_ ones, it wouldn't:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$foo = $True  ?     1   :      0    # proposed ternary\r\n$foo = if ($True) { 1 } else { 0 }  # equivalent `if` statement\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$foo = 1 + ($True  ?     1   :      0)   # nesting OK; note that + would have higher precedence\r\n$foo = 1 + if ($True) { 1 } else { 0 }  # !! doesn't work\r\n$foo = 1 + (if ($True) { 1 } else { 0 })  # !! doesn't work, even with parentheses\r\n$foo = 1 + $(if ($True) { 1 } else { 0 })  # only $(...) (and situationally @(...)) work\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe need for `$()` / `@()` is more than just a syntax inconvenience: it has behavioral and performance implications.\r\n\r\nThat said, I _wish_ that statements such as `if` and `foreach` were bona fide expressions (two more examples of things currently failing: `foreach ($i in 1..5) { $i } | Write-Output` or `foreach ($i in 1..5) { $i } > out.txt`).\r\nI don't know enough to judge whether they _cannot be_, however and/or if there's a backward-compatibility concern.\r\nSee also: #6817\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf `if` were to become a full expression in PowerShell, then you could make the argument that led to the removal of the ternary conditional from Rust: it is then no longer _necessary_.\r\n\r\nHowever, my motivation for this proposal was never _necessity_ - it's about concision, convenience, and readability (visual clutter).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n>  I don't have a concrete proposal to use ? in PowerShell, but it feels like ? could be better used for error handling than for a conditional expression.\r\n\r\nI think that introducing `?` with fundamentally different semantics than in C# would be a source of everlasting confusion.\r\n\r\nSeparately, improvements in PowerShell's error handling are well worth discussing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "🤔 it might work, but it would be more awkward than any of the proposed alternatives. `-replace` works that way because it just accepts an actual array of arguments. `.Replace()` is not managed by the PS team -- it's a method on the .NET `System.String` class.\r\n\r\nIf we were to try to use either of those syntaxes it'd mean either an ETS method (which is OK, but tends to add a bit of performance overhead to creation of objects it needs to be attached to) or, with the operator version you propose, we wouldn't be able to easily have an array as an argument.\r\n\r\nWithout special-casing such an operator in the parser, we wouldn't be able to short-circuit. Ternary syntaxes in other languages generally exist because you _don't want_ to actually evaluate both options; the compute time is quicker if only the correct branch needs to be evaluated, rather than having to full evaluate both options (which might come with some significant side effects).\r\n\r\nAnd since that would already require special-casing, it would be more effective to introduce new syntax for it, to minimise confusion (it would be a bit misleading to have something that looks like an array but can't be used like one; it wouldn't support creating the \"array\" ahead of time and passing that as a variable, for example). The fact that method arguments already conflict a bit with array syntax is often already misleading. I don't think I'd want to add a _third_ variant behaviour for commas to the mix.",

I personally value concision, but not at the expense of readability; even if I _could_ write `$true?$number:42`, I wouldn't.\r\n\r\n(Backward compatibility will indeed be a problem when (hint, hint) we implement [null-conditional access](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3240). PowerShell's permissiveness with respect to identifier names is generally problematic, as @KirkMunro  has recently argued, but [that ship has sailed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10165))",
