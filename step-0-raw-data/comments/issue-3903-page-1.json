    "body": "Minor update to add back `Microsoft.PowerShell.CoreCLR.AssemblyExtensions.LoadFrom(string assemblyPath)` for the short term. This is because PackageManagement depends on this API and thus removing this API will instantly break PackageManagement.\r\n\r\nSince the `LoadFrom` functionality has been removed from our assembly load context, we just call `Assembly.LoadFrom(string)` in the above API. I also added `ObsoleteAttribute` to this API to prevent new code from using it. @brywang-msft is working on migrating PackageManagement to .NET Core 2.0. Once that work is done, the above API will be permanently removed from PowerShell Core. This is added to the follow-up tasks in the issue.\r\n\r\nI have verified that PackageManagement works with this update.\r\nI also verified that host powershell in an application is the same as in FullCLR after this change.",
