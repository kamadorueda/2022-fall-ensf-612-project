    "body": "`Send-MailMessage` in its current implemented code logic only supports piping attachment file paths into the cmdlet:\r\n```powershell\r\nfile1.txt, file2.txt | Send-MailMessage -To $address -From $address -SmtpServer 127.0.0.1 -Subject \"Mail with attachments\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the file paths `file1.txt` and `file2.txt` are added to the mail message in the `ProcessRecord` block of the cmdlet and the mail is sent in the `EndProcessing` block.\r\n\r\nUsing named parameter pipeline binding, the mail has to be sent within the `ProcessRecord` block, because the pipeline may contain several input objects with named parameters:\r\n```powershell\r\n$objects  = [PSCustomObject]@{Subject = \"First mail\"; To = $address; From = $address; SmtpServer = '127.0.0.1'}, [PSCustomObject]@{Subject = \"Second mail\"; To = $address; From = $address; SmtpServer = '127.0.0.1'}\r\n$objects | Send-MailMessage\r\n```\r\n**Small problem:**\r\nSince `Attachments` is the default pipeline input and it's type is `string[]` the named parameter objects would be bound as well to Attachments.\r\nFor the case above, the Attachments property would still be set like this:\r\n```csharp\r\nAttachments[0] = \"@{Subject = \"First mail\"; To = $address; From = $address; SmtpServer = '127.0.0.1'}\"\r\nAttachments[1] = \"@{Subject = \"Second mail\"; To = $address; From = $address; SmtpServer = '127.0.0.1'}\"\r\n```\r\nSince those are not valid file paths, the mail message would throw. \r\n\r\nTherefore the two cases have to be differentiated:\r\n\r\n1. Attachment file paths as pipeline input: Send a single mail message in the `EndProcessing` block (current behavior)\r\n2. Objects with named parameters as pipeline input: Send a mail message per pipeline item in `ProcessRecord` block (described above)",
