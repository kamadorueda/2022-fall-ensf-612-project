I also had to install Common Tools for Visual C++ 2015 (modify VS install) to make vcvarsall.bat available on my system. Now I'm left with the final issue where CMake doesn't recognize the C++ compiler. Will update when I fix this.\n\n**Update:** VS 15 support for CMake is due October with 3.7.0 release. So will be reverting to Visual Studio 2015. https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/milestones/2\n\nOn another note:\nThe Start-PSBootstrap function install CMake portable if CMake is not already on the system. When it does this, it adds C:\\Program Files(x86)\\CMake to the Path but this path does not exist with CMake portable. Instead Cmake will be located in C:\\ProgramData\\chocolatey\\bin\n",

    "body": ".NET Core development does not require Visual Studio but for C++ code, you need a C++ compiler and on Windows you'd typically use Visual Studio to get that.  However, the C++ team announced a stand-alone compiler in a [NuGet pkg](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/02/16/try-out-the-latest-c-compiler-toolset-without-waiting-for-the-next-update-of-visual-studio/) back in February.  This is a \"preview\" of C++ v.next so that might not be ideal.  \n\nStill, I wonder if that could be made to work with the PS Core build - if indeed you'd like to eliminate the VS dependency for the Windows build.  That said, you can get the VS Community Edition for free so requiring VS for the C++ on Windows doesn't seem to onerous to me.\n",
