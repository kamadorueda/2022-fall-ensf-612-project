    "body": "> `using module` does seem to work (didn't realize it would work with `ScriptsToProcess`. It's not ideal though, because `using module` only works with relative paths, so my script is now coupled to being run from a single location.\r\n\r\n*With* `ScriptstoProcess`? The idea would be to use it *instead of* `ScriptsToProcess`.  You'd put the classes in your `psm1` and use `using module` in the scripts that utilize the classes.  The whole `ScriptsToProcess` thing with classes is something someone came up with as a hack to get around scoping issues, but really it just moves them around and makes it less predictable. But if it works, it works 🤷‍♂ \r\n",
