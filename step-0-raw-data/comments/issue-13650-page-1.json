(Get-Item.Tests.ps1:140) precisely mirrors the test that had already existed for files (Get-Item.Tests.ps1:131).  If there's a deficiency in the test I copied from, then another issue needs to be opened to revisit all of the tests in that file to verify terminating versus non-terminating errors.  I'm not certain, but I think that's out of scope of this issue and PR.\r\n\r\n> A for tests, we could combine tests with `-TestCases` for files and directories because they have the same code.\r\n\r\nI need a lot more information on the testing system, and it's not available in Get-Help It/Get-Help Should.  Is there documentation anywhere that you can point me to?  (Is there external documentation that should be pointed to in the PowerShell contribution documentation?)\r\n\r\nThe issues about the test framework that I am ignorant of and need to educate myself on are:\r\n\r\n1. I'm not sure how to write a test for a non-terminating error.  All the other examples I found for errors that are normally non-terminating used `-ErrorAction Stop` to cause them to throw. (see Get-Item.Tests.ps1:131 for the file case that was already there when I started, and Get-Item.Tests.ps1:140 for the directory case that I copied the form of line 131 for).  Is there an example you can find for non-terminating errors that I can write it around to test that it's non-terminating?  (It actually is a non-terminating error, exactly the same as for files, but the preexisting test for the file error turns it into a terminating error for the test.  I copied that style.)\r\n\r\n2. I don't understand your reference to `-TestCases` as a separate command or option, and I need documentation to understand.\r\n  - Tests for specific stream names against files versus directories can be consolidated, as there is no difference in behavior.\r\n  - Tests for wildcard stream names against files versus directories cannot be consolidated, if the wildcard is '*', because a file will always have at least one stream of type $DATA (the unnamed one), while directories by default have no data streams (and can never have an unnamed one).  As a result, the output will always differ between a file and a directory, and the tests need to be different as a result.",

Since the -Path parameter is an array, this is not the appropriate action (i.e., a path on a non-supporting filesystem before a path on a supporting filesystem in the array will prevent the operation continuing to the supporting filesystem and working there).

For directories, this means that the list can be empty without an error condition. This case is handled correctly.\r\n\r\nWhen GetLastWin33Error() returns ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER, AlternateDataStreamUtilities throws a NotSupportedException. This is uncaught above, which means it gets caught by the general exception handler which turns it into a terminating error. (This is the situation which caused me to block committing this PR.)\r\n\r\nIf GetLastWin32Error() returns anything else (which is possible, since filesystems can return anything they want without the system filtering them), there's nothing we can do in AlternateDataStreamUtilities -- we have to throw Win32Exception because the driver isn't behaving according to the protocol we understand, so we have no means of interpreting it into a user-friendly error message. This is also uncaught above, and also turns into a terminating error.\r\n\r\nI had been thinking of leaving the Win32Exception as terminating, but had not yet made up my mind -- but I think the impact analyses between this and the NotSupportedException case are the same, and suggest that both should be made nonterminating. I mean, the same issue of -Path being an array applies, and it would definitely be a per-filesystem behavior that might not apply to later entries in the array. The same logic which could apply to NotSupportedException could easily also apply to Win32Exception. So, I'll do that, unless you can suggest a reason not to?\r\n\r\n(Also, regardless of whether it's an edge-case, I really think we should try to find a way to code some tests on a filesystem that doesn't support alternate data streams. ReFS doesn't support them, and many administrators are going to run scripts on systems with both NTFS and ReFS. Because stream-unsupported errors on one filesystem must not terminate processing of a -Path array, I think it's important enough to put into CI regression tests. I only caught it when I was doing manual tests locally, and it would be really easy to miss otherwise. I just have no idea who to ask how to do so; can you suggest somebody?)",
