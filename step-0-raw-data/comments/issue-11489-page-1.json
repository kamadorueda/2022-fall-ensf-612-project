Processing to date uses fixed (US) processing to string uses local culture. Days would need to look at the local culture and uses choice of first day of the week. lu..ve only makes sense if you have French set as a your culture. Does Fri..Mon make sense ?

    "body": "> @vexx32: 'a'..'z' is already a thing ^^\r\n\r\nIt's a thing because `[char]` (in most cases) \"naturally\" map onto an integer sequence (so we know how to step) and it seemed like an obvious target use case. The decision to accept strings as valid operands was based on the assumption that we would never attempt to implement \"string range\" functionality - Should it produce the cartesian product of all permutations? what alphabet would we pick - just visible ASCII chars, latin alphabet or exhaust all supported unicode planes? Does it even make sense from a space-complexity perspective? \r\n\r\nSo the key here is that `..` doesn't need to \"know\" anything about the alphabet or what the host application renders on screen - it just needs boundary values from which it produces a directed range of values.\r\n\r\nEven if we ignore the localization issue @jhoneill points out here, it's impossible to infer the behavior of a meaningful range expansion for months or weekdays exactly because they're cyclic in nature:\r\n\r\nRange expansion behavior (which is directional) would dictate:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS ~> December..August\r\nDecember\r\nNovember\r\nOctober\r\nSeptember\r\nAugust\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is probably not what you want, and therefore not useful at all, 90% of the time - except for those 10% cases where it is, which we wouldn't be able to consistently implement if we were to respect the cyclic nature of time",
