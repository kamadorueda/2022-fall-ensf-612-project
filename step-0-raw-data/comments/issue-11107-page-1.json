Most seem like a good idea only the to people implementing them at the time.  Because the console host does colour with escape sequences redirecting to a file or the clipboard doesn't give \"clean\" output but something \"polluted\" with escape sequences.  So for every person you please by making files a different color you've annoyed 2 others, one who actively wants monochrome (or at least no escape sequences) and one who doesn't mind color in principle but objects to the chosen color scheme. \r\n",

That means if you have an accessibility issue, you can engineer your own to suit your needs. If you have strong aesthetic tastes you do something which pleases you. \r\nGenerally things should be always be able to be overridden by those files. ",
