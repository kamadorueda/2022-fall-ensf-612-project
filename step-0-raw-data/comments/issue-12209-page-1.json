I want to point out that we recently created documentation that helps outline the creation process for predictor modules! it can also viewed [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dev-cross-plat/create-cmdline-predictor?view=powershell-7.2). I also know [Az.Tools.Predictor](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Az.Tools.Predictor/1.0.1) does something similar in order to fill in location/subscription/resource group for the predicted values, it is all done locally too.
