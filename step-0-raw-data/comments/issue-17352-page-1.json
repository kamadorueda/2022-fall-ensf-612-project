    "body": "Hello. Modules don't solve the problem when one module depends on another and one of them depends on the previous imported. Powershell can't work this way - it try recursvely add modules and stops running with it.\r\n\r\nSo I added check if this module was added by some variable initialization, but there is a problem. If I run my script via IDE I have to remove this variables before adding modules. It's inconvenient. And there is no difference between Import-Module or simply adding by '.\\scrips.ps1'. So if no diff I prefer point.\r\n\r\nI use my script library and change it from time to time. Also I use it from different computers. That's why importing to computer is inconvenient too.",
