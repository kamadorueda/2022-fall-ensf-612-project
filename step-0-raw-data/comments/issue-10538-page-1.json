    "body": "Not so much explicitly _intended_ by PowerShell, but more a function of how reference types behave.\r\n\r\nA majority of .NET types are reference types, which means that if you assign the value to another variable, only the reference to that item is assigned. This avoids what would otherwise be a significant amount of processing overhead that would be required to entirely copy the objects, and essentially means that if you assign a reference to a variable, it will still affect the original variable or the original object it was attached to.\r\n\r\nTo cover the few cases where you _do_ want to create actual copies of items, many classes have `Clone()` methods which can be applied to create copies, though the degree to which they are copied and how much data can be duplicated will vary depending on the implementation for that individual class.\r\n\r\nAccording to the documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml.xmlelement.clonenode?view=netframework-4.8) there is a `.CloneNode()` method on XmlElement, so you should be able to do `$test = $content.data.seriesDetail.series.CloneNode($true)` to create a copy of the node to work with and modify without affecting the original node. The `$true` boolean tells the method to copy all child nodes as well; if you instead pass `$false` as the argument, only the target node is cloned; all child nodes would remain references to the originals.",
