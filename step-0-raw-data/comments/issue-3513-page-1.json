I'm not sure why your system still has the old binary, but you shouldn't use it.\r\n\r\nThat parameter was an internal flag used in V3-V5 to accept input from the unmanaged code while the engine was still starting up, making PowerShell feel more responsive unless your profile defined a `prompt` function, in which case this flag was passed to the managed code.\r\n\r\nTo run the 32 bit powershell.exe, you would run `%SystemRoot%\\syswow64\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe`.",
