Can you think of a way to apply that to this without taking a large performance hit (and still maintaining backward compatibility)?\r\n\r\nThey have added another method to the visitor classes (at least, I believe so, correct me if I'm wrong @rjmholt @daxian-dbw) called `VisitOther` or `DefaultVisit` that *sort of* allows that.

The engine has to reference the SMA package of version 6.1 for getting the APIs that it needs such as e.g. `SemanticVersion`, which was only added in v6. As I've discussed already in issue #10372, newer SMA packages do not allow .Net Standard projects to reference the library, which requires now the specific .net Core version. I opened issue https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellStandard/issues/67 for getting PowerShell Standard v6 for references against v6.x only. Similary, we'd  either need a package for v7x only and the conditionally compile against v6 and v7 or just have one package, which is the union of v6/7 (the former would be required only if PSSA has specific rule modiifcations for features only added in v7)\r\nTherefore the first, blocking issue is the lack of proper reference libraries that also support .net standard. This should be solved first and the PS team has ignored community complaints from e.g. @jaykul for a while, now is the time to address them.\r\nSeparating out the parser into it's own project will be a bigger undertaking but maybe a first step would be to try compile SMA against `netstandard2.1` so that usage of the SMA NuGet package for referencing only becomes more useful. Otherwise, we'll probably have to live with conditional compilation for a while.",

This should be solved first and the PS team has ignored community complaints from e.g. @Jaykul for a while, now is the time to address them.\r\n\r\nMaybe we can consolidate issues here. I opened this issue with precisely these issues in mind. There's no easy solution here, but as PowerShell 7 stabilises, I also feel we need to address them head-on.",
