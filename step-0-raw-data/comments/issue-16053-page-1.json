In the image above the \"âŒ„\" has already been pressed and has turned into a \"âŒƒ\" which is to hide the additional actions.\r\n\r\nI think the colored icon \"Run as Administrator\" is populated as a form of quick-access action.\r\n\r\nIf this is correct, the workaround is to just avoid the attention grabbing colored icon \"Run as Administrator\" \r\nIt is troublesome to ignore the quickly accessible one, click the \"âŒ„\" show more action sign each time to get to the right \"Run as administrator\" .\r\n\r\nSo in the original issue description, issue is not selective by powershell version. It happens for powershell versions (in my case, all versions) including the 'windows powershell ISE', which have this colored icon \"Run as Administrator\" quick-access-action. Strangely, for the 'Windows powershell ISE' the colored icon \"Run as Administrator\" does not appear in its own action list, but is appended to that of \"Window powershell\", which could be another bug.\r\n\r\nOther applications when run as administrator, do not make this extra colored icon \"Run as Administrator\" .\r\nI don't have any other app which has a colored icon \"Run as Administrator\" when they are type-to-search-ed to.\r\n\r\nIn the case of other application, rarely does the need arise to run then as administrator, so they do not require a quick-access action. Powershell is run as administrator frequently. So populating, 'Run as Administrator\" as a quick-access action of the powershell app is a handy feature, only that it should not minimize the UAC.\r\n\r\nSo the question is who is authoring/registering/invoking those quick-access action?\r\npowershell/ powershell installer/ powershell chocolatey installer/ windows-10 ?\r\n\r\nI hope I am not jumping to hasty conclusion.\r\n",

Both it and the standard-powershell 5.1.19041.1682, have the double standard-outline-icon and the colored-in-icon-shortcuts.

The colored-in-icon-shortcut is always shown as a quick shortcut before the more-arrow press, though I am sure I click it much less.\r\nAlso, quick and preferable, is to press 'Win-x , a'  , this pops up the standard-powershell-5.1 into the foreground as expected.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, a question to ask, is how those shortcuts got created.
