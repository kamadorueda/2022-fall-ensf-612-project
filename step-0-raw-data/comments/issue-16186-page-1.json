There are many ways where it differs significantly (dynamic binding, type conversions are done for you, etc).",

PowerShell lets you implicitly convert from `string` and `char[]` where C# requires you to call `ToCharArray()`.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of PowerShell, `string, object, object` is just as likely as `char[], int, int` due to conversion rules.
