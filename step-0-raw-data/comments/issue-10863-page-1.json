(just kidding).\r\n\r\nSo it sounds like the following changes are worth making:\r\n\r\n* Streamline the `OutBuffer` code and precede it with a comment; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Ignore -OutBuffer to prevent DoS attacks. \r\n# If that is not a concern and you want -OutBuffer support, remove this `if` statement.\r\nif ($PSBoundParameters.ContainsKey('OutBuffer')) { $PSBoundParameters.Remove('OutBuffer') }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the code now _removes_ the `OutBuffer`  value (tantamount to setting it to `0`, i.e. _no_ buffering), which I presume was the original intent.\r\n\r\n* In the spirit of _so errors with a proxy looked as much as possible like they did without the proxy_, replace the `throw` statements in all `catch` blocks with `$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminatingError($_)` as suggested by @SeeminglyScience ",
