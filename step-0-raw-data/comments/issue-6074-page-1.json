The main criterion in PowerShell Core development was and remains the preservation of backward compatibility in order to exclude altogether or even reduce the need to change scripts and modules. \r\nThe current version has many passes, but over time, compatibility will be better as .Net Core APIs and missing cmdlets and modules are ported.\r\nThe backward compatibility also implies that we do not need to change the .ps1 extension. \"1\" comes from PowerShell v1.0 - since then, backward compatibility has been observed.",

And even if it’s the case, I do believe that fully backward compatibility is not always a good idea. I do believe that we sometime need to empower change to correct the past to make things better. Looking at Java always guided themselves on backward compatibility, and today they always regret that why didn’t they make a breaking change version in the early day to bring support for features such as Reifield Generics. If Google engineers think the same way as you guys then the world would never have the very nice framework Angular 2. I give up and keep going with Ubuntu then, there are lots of command lines options on that world for me to choose what I want, never try again Windows with PS is the only option so you guy can close my issue without bothering bring it into any consideration.",
