    "body": "The problem with this is that `using module` is a parse time concept.  So that means:\r\n\r\n1. Allowing the path to be dynamic would increase the time to parse the document, which greatly slows down editors.  `using module` already makes parsing really slow, but it's worth mentioning\r\n1. The variable would be evaluated at parse time, not runtime.  That may not sound like a big deal in theory, but in practice it would feel *really* bad.  That's part of why so few people even know about dynamic keywords, as a parse time only concept they feel terrible.\r\n\r\n> The variables already exist prior to running powershell, and I imagine they have to be loaded prior to modules, so I would assume that such would be possible, but I am not sure how the back end works on this subject.\r\n\r\nThey might exist, but they're not constants.  They'll still be pulled on every request because you can change them at any point.\r\n\r\nAlso it's worth noting that you can use `using module .\\path\\relative\\to\\file.psm1` and the <kbd>.</kbd> will work like `$PSScriptRoot`. Everything else in PowerShell uses that to refer to the current working directory except `using` statements.",
