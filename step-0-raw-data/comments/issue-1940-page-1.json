Mike, what do you think about this proposition?\n\nAs far as I know, we need two parts for native compilation on windows:\n- VS C++ compiler itself + headers.\n- win 10 SDK with lib for the linker.\n\nI think the first one could be downloaded as a nuget package.\n\nI definitely support desire to have \"fewer dependencies\". Meanwhile, I also think that full VS provides a very good dev experience on windows (compare to VS code in it's current state) and likely would be used by most developers anyway.  \n",

    "body": "@vors #1440 removed the Win 10 SDK requirement, so that simplified things a bit.\n\n@kilasuit Can you clarify your intentions here? Are you experimenting with building all components that we currently build (native + managed) without installing VS? If you just care about building the managed components, then you would just need to modify build.psm1 with a \"-BuildManagedOnly\" parameter to carve out the native dependencies.\n\nAssuming that you want to build everything (native and managed), I think simplifying the dependencies is a good thing if we can do it and still meet the existing requirements. \n\nOn Windows platforms for CoreCLR, the goal is to build a single WinRM plugin binary (pwrshplugin.dll) that works across all supported flavors of Windows (7, 8, 8.1, 10, Nano Server, and IoT). The easiest way to meet this requirement is to build it the same way CoreCLR builds native DLLs using [the same dependencies](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/Documentation/building/windows-instructions.md). Additionally, the PowerShell project must also produce native powershell.exe and pwrshplugin.dll binaries for FullCLR to ensure backward compatibility with Windows PowerShell. \n\nStart-PSBuild and Start-PSBootStrap test for the union of these two requirements to ensure that it can build the binaries appropriately. Any change to those cmdlets should take that need into consideration.\n\nAlternately, if there is strong community desire to streamline the build process and do a managed-only build of PowerShell Core (everything except pwrshplugin.dll), that would be another change to build.psm1 that could be interesting.\n",
