    "body": "@vexx32 The addition operator always has lower precedence than the comma operator however not all commas are operators e.g. in the top level of method calls, the comma lexically separates arguments, not array elements. Note that indexing does *not* do this - in an index expression, the commas are operators (see below).\r\n\r\nThe way PowerShell uses the comma for arrays is intended to be consistent with the way arrays are passed as a single argument to a command i.e. as comma-separated lists without delimiters. For example:\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-MyCommand 1, 2, 3\r\n```\r\nThis example is passing one argument which is a three element array. Here's the same thing using a variable:\r\n```powershell\r\n$arr = 1, 2, 3\r\nInvoke-MyCommand $arr\r\n```\r\nAgain - one argument with three elements. Contrast this with splatting\r\n```powershell\r\n$arr = 1, 2, 3\r\nInvoke-MyCommand @arr\r\n```\r\nwhich passes three arguments, each of which has a single scalar value.\r\n\r\nWe chose to favour array concatenation over addition on individual elements as the construction of lists is implicit in most PowerShell operations:\r\n```powershell\r\n$result1 =  echo 1, 2  \r\n$result1 += echo 3, 4\r\n$result2 =  1,2 + 3, 4\r\n$result3 =  $result1 + $result2\r\n$result3 +=  4, 5, 6 \r\n```\r\nMixing and matching commands and expression just works with no extra parentheses.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at array indexing. In PowerShell, and array index expression takes a _single_ index which is either a scalar or array value so:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS[1] (17) >   $a = 1..10\r\nPS[1] (18) >   $a[1,3,5,7]\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n```\r\nis equivalent to\r\n```powershell\r\nPS[1] (19) >   $index = 1,3,5,7\r\nPS[1] (20) >   $a[$index]\r\n2\r\n4\r\n6\r\n8\r\n```\r\nwhich is effectively equivalent to splatting without actually splatting. \r\n\r\nMethod invocation is where things get inconsistent because commas are lexical elements that separate arguments (as opposed to commands where arguments are separated by spaces.) This means that the following works:\r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore (1:127) >  \"hello world\".substring(0+1, 2+3)\r\nello\r\n```\r\nAlthough in this example,  it appears that addition has higher precedence than comma, this is, in fact not the case because the comma here is not an operator, it's a lexical token that separates arguments. Ultimately this approach was the one that most people preferred despite the inconsistency. For one thing, it made transcribing C# code fragments trivial.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, some alternatives we considered included parsing methods like commands where spaces separated arguments:  `\"hello world\".substring(1  (2+3))` but the feedback on this was negative. We also considered using commands for member invocation\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-Object -InputObject \"Hello world\" SubString 0 3\r\n```\r\nBut this was felt to be too verbose.  (though this is pretty much what we implemented with `ForEach-Object`\r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore (1:128) >  ForEach-Object -InputObject \"Hello world\" SubString 0 3\r\nHel\r\n```\r\n\r\nOverall, taking everything in context, I'm reasonably satisfied with most of the decisions we made in this area. That said, many of these decisions were made well over a decade ago. Given a decade and a half of broad user experience it would be interesting to see how things might be refactored. But the hard part, then and as now, is keeping the entire system in mind and consistent.\r\n\r\n",

We covered this topic in some detail in chapter 3, but there are a couple of things we still need to cover. **In terms of precedence, the comma operator has the highest precedence of any operator except for casts and property or array references.** This means that when you‚Äôre building an array with expressions, you need to wrap those expressions in parentheses. In the next example, you‚Äôll build an array containing the values 1, 2, and 3. You‚Äôll use addition to calculate the final value. Because the comma operator binds more strongly than the plus operator, you won‚Äôt get what you want:\r\n> ```\r\n> PS (1) > 1,2,1+2\r\n> 1\r\n> 2\r\n> 1\r\n> 2\r\n> ```",
