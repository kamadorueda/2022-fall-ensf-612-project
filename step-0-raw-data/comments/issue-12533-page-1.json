(Unknown keys in the manifest are ignored, so it shouldn't reduce what is there for down-level users). \r\n\r\nI have no idea of the practicalities but I'd call this highly desirable. \r\n",

I have found that [the workarounds](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40441684/1404637) aren't too bad though.  Implementing this wouldn't really enable encapsulating classes in modules as that is already (somewhat awkwardly) possible.  But this feature would make doing so more convenient.",

It works, right up until you need to unload and reload the module in the same session; it'll explode because there are already defined classes by those names. To work around that, I have my `ScriptsToProcess` handle it by checking if the type name already exists, and quietly preventing the classes from being re-defined.\r\n\r\nIt's definitely not ideal, and it'd be awesome if this were provided as a feature, especially as many module authors may have some classes they'd like exported, and others kept private to the module.",

It sounds like you're describing #2505 (and [stackoverflow 42838107](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42838107)).  \r\n\r\nI expect PowerShell classes will continue to be expensive to support and painful to develop with.  Because of that I'm reluctant to recommend native PowerShell classes beyond their use with DSC; we already have full-blown C# classes for free.  In my own work I have found few scenarios where PowerShell classes turned out to be the right choice.\r\n\r\nC# classes added during module loading with Add-Type are available everywhere in the PowerShell session via `[Namespace.MyClass]`, so no export feature like this is required.  That strategy puts some strain on your module loading structure, but I have found the benefits of getting that right to be worth the effort.",
