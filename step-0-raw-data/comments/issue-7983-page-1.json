    "body": "Well, no, of course not. ðŸ˜„ \r\n\r\nIt would be unrealistic to expect it all fixed at once, but I think it's well past the time where the framework for this should be in place.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth reaching out to the author of the aforementioned module and asking if they are interested in potentially translating portions of their module to be incorporated into the native Write-Progress cmdlet.\r\n\r\nI think the most sensible overall course of action is:\r\n\r\n1. First have it be treated with parity to the other stream-writing cmdlets in terms of implementing appropriate stream handling and object classes for it.\r\n    * I have... some ideas... in terms of what the framework for what you guys may want the `ProgressRecord` object to consist of.\r\n    * Unlike the existing streams, the Progress stream would likely need some measure of concurrency and may be best handled inside a secondary runspace entirely -- there are some cases where multiple progress displays may need to be handled at once, for example, as well as the fun chaos that can happen with nested progress displays.\r\n    * Additionally, the stream may need to be written such that the objects *in* the stream can be accessed and written to by the cmdlet in order to update them -- *complicated*. Potentially: retain `ref` items for things submitted to the stream for display?\r\n2. Once the framework behind the scenes can be trusted, then the next step is to rework the display formatter for the progress stream and decouple it from the cmdlet itself. There are some edge cases there that we may want to deal with at that point.\r\n    * e.g., should / can the display change with X amount of progress items currently being shown? Squash progress bar(s)? Should the stream be given some kind of reference that can indicate whether the stream is done with, or is that burden on the caller (i.e., Write-Progress)? Timeout values? How do we avoid leaving \"dead\" / \"abandoned\" items in the display? Etc., etc.\r\n3. Once we have a relatively consistent handling of the display and of how it works with both cmdlets and functions that want to call out to the stream, *then* we would have the room and the backing implementation more or less ready to implement the more user-facing fixes.\r\n\r\nBut, of course, several of those are fairly large **???** in terms of how long they would take and the finer details of their implementation.\r\n\r\nThat said, however, I think that although PowerShell's focus *is* automation, it is relatively important to be capable of supporting a consistent and accessible progress display. Currently, the verbose and other streams are, I would think, somewhat *overburdened*, because there is no other effective and simple way to really report progress on a large job.",

    "body": "My thought is essentially that having it mimic the current stream natures is a good parallel and provides more flexibility. For example, currently only *one* command can really display progress at a time. Providing the capability for more commands to display progress (potentially as sub-progress-bars?) at the same time permits a more verbose display if needed without excessively heavy amounts of `Write-Verbose` within a script which leaves you with *screens* of yellow text that sometimes manages to be *harder* to make sense of than just a blinking cursor with no indication of what's going on.\r\n\r\nGranted, you may not always *want* all of these to display; potentially we could deviate a bit from the standard \"action\" parameters of ErrorActionPreference and the like for something more suitable, perhaps setting the number of 'nested command progress bars' that are displayed with the main command as a preference variable.\r\n\r\nI am more than open to alternative ideas, and as you point out _completely_ copying the existing stream behaviour is not likely to yield a worthwhile result, as I have previously touched upon with a few points here and there.  ðŸ˜„ ",
