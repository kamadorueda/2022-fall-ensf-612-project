The engine cannot take control back from something that is not either script based, or is a method from the engine itself that is specifically checking for requests from another thread.\r\n\r\nSomething that makes that prospect a lot more complicated is that writing an object as output is directly tied to the invocation of the next command's process block/`ProcessRecord` method.  Even streams other than output like error and verbose can be redirected as output.  So whatever process is running to record messages from other threads would need to know when to output these messages in a way that preserves execution order.",

In my example above, it's the `.GetAwaiter().GetResult()` line at the very end. As far as the end user is concerned, this is still a synchronous process - it's just leveraging an async method under the hood. The method is async in the first place to allow for compatibility with other ecosystems (in my specific use case, the same library is also used for a WPF application).\r\n\r\nThe trouble is that the async item is still handled on a separate thread, even though the PowerShell engine is blocking and waiting for its completion.

PowerShell has no visibility into what your code is doing, even if it's just waiting on code from another thread.\r\n\r\nWhat you could do instead of blocking on the result, is set up a blocking collection that allows you to marshal calls back to the context of your cmdlet.  Something like:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic class AsyncExample : PSCmdlet, IDisposable\r\n{\r\n    private readonly BlockingCollection<Action> _asyncRequests = new BlockingCollection<Action>();\r\n\r\n    private readonly CancellationTokenSource _stopProcessing = new CancellationTokenSource();\r\n\r\n    public void Dispose()\r\n    {\r\n        _asyncRequests.Dispose();\r\n        _stopProcessing.Dispose();\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected override void StopProcessing() => _stopProcessing.Cancel();\r\n\r\n    protected override void EndProcessing()\r\n    {\r\n        var task = Task.Run(() => _asyncRequests.Add(() => WriteObject(\"something\")));\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            while (_asyncRequests.TryTake(out Action asyncRequest, -1, _stopProcessing.Token))\r\n            {\r\n                asyncRequest();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n        catch (OperationCanceledException)\r\n        {\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou need a way to gracefully \"complete\" and probably a few other things but that gives the general idea.",

    "body": "> On the other hand, if the goal is to support in-band user notification of asynchronous events, that is more interesting but might lead to a different approach.\r\n\r\nThis is what I'm going for. Basically, I'd like an asynchronous, background thread to be able to call Cmdlet.WriteVerbose() and have the Cmdlet object handle any thread safety concerns transparently.\r\n\r\nIn my particular use case, I only need one callback at a time, and I block until that background worker is complete anyway. (This is the use case for which I provided a code example in the first post.) These are just implementation details, though.\r\n\r\nI understand there would be no guaranteed order if there are multiple callbacks happening on multiple background threads - I see that as a \"let the buyer beware\" kind of situation. If a user wanted to have multiple background threads going at once, I don't see an issue with the warning that \"these are not in a guaranteed order, and they could be confusing.\"",

I am not sure in which case they would  be counter-indicated.\r\n\r\nHowever these sets of cmdlets don't properly respect switches and preferences (e.g. if you call CommandRuntime.Host.UI.WriteVerboseLine() it will write verbose output even if -Verbose is not specified, and doesn't honor $VerbosePreference.) So no free lunch here either, unless we manually parse the command line switches and env vars for the entire family of functions ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy use case is that I'd like to register a method to get updates from the library for a long running process, e.g.:\r\n\r\n_mydependency.ProgressUpdates +=     ...   {     ...WriteProgress(...) };\r\n_mydependency.DebugMessages +=     ...   {     ...WriteVerbose(...) };\r\n  \r\n\r\n",

    "body": "At a glance it looks fine for what is there as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem with trying to tie async into PowerShell generically is that it's a \"pit of failure\". Meaning that there's a lot of random engine specific knowledge you have to know in order to do it safely. PowerShell is designed from the ground up to store all of it's state in a thread static way. The exception that gets thrown when trying to write from a different thread is actually the *kind* way this manifests.\r\n\r\nEven something as simple as calling `this.MyInvocation.MyCommand.Parameters` from a different thread can cause dead locks and/or state corruption. The `AsyncCmdlet` used internally by the `PackageManagement` module [had this issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices/issues/762) for example.\r\n\r\nWhile a lot of things may end up working fine, a seemingly small change can have huge consequences due to this architecture. Basically, if you're on a different thread, you should just straight up never touch the `PSCmdlet` instance at all unless you have a deep understanding of how the engine works internally.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I'd like to see a utility class that makes this sort of thread communication easier but I fear tying it into a subclass of `PSCmdlet` may set the wrong expectation. Even if it was it's own standalone class I'd be very hesitant to suggest it be added to SMA.",

Didn't turn out that simple.\r\n\r\nAnyway, thanks for your help and insight, hopefully it will be considered for the future.\r\n",
