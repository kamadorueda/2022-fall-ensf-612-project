Some of the history commands I run are multi-line ones and a -q would be  a good addition to that.   (For more than one thing I my profile deletes an alias and defines a function of the same name.  So I still have ihy, but Invoke-History in is unchanged, for \"h\"  my version searches for command lines with matching text if the input isn't a number but Get-History is unchanged ... etc.) \r\n ",
