    "body": "Summary from email:\n- We are using the latest drops of .NET CLI; so at this time, 1.0.0-rc2-002416, and will continue to do so\n- We currently depend on \"NETStandard.Library\": \"1.5.0-rc3-24011-00\"\n- We will change that dependency to “Microsoft.NETCore.App”: “1.0.0-rc2-3002416”\n- We will continue to use \"dotnet-test-xunit\": \"1.0.0-dev-140469-38\", and it will work (Peter?)\n- ~~We use VS Code’s C# 0.3.7 (latest published) extension to debug, which will work with RC2 bits~~ Update docs to use GitHub release of extension\n- After changing to NETCore.App, we will be using the shared host framework, such that our app.deps.json will only contain non FX assemblies\n- We can then accomplish our original goal of working around both the custom AssemblyLoadContext and hard-coded TypeCatalog for the app dependencies by separately and explicitly loading (and analyzing) each assembly in app.deps.json (Dongbo?)\n- We will additionally be able to package PowerShell without embedding the .NET runtime (FX assemblies), thus making Raghu’s job much easier\n- Our Linux and OS X packages will require a dependency on the .NET Core runtime and framework\n",
