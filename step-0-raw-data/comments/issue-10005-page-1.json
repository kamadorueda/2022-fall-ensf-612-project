I simply add those OPTOUT options by default on every test machine to reduce noise. It is clearly the **AppInsights** silent optin - I went through your IP list and crossreferenced some of the ip's with my logs. Might also I just missed some smallprint somewhere but I don't remember any AppInsights part during installation. \r\n\r\nSeriously, the only consistant thing is the missuse of the word telemetry across all MS products where one should write user data collection or spyware in short. So what's next APPINSIGHTS_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT? ",

Double checked once again. DOTNET_... shouldn't even be there since that variable is not in function you've mentioned but I've set all kind of combinations to be sure (the documentation is not really clear about it and the whole discussion here proves it)",

That said, you're opting out of that telemetry too.\r\n\r\nIt is possible it is another MS shared library (or PowerShell module) that is sending the telemetry.  PowerShell does run in a conhost.exe instance.  Do you see these connections if you fire up cmd.exe?  That would rule out conhost.exe (since cmd.exe also uses it).  There is active development going on with conhost right now. Maybe they're looking for telemetry on usage?",
