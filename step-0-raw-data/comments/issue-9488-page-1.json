There is no change in behaviour of the module once loaded.\r\n\r\nFrom a bit of reading up on it, it looks like the HintPath is used to reference external assemblies that _aren't included_ in the project build itself. The SkiaSharp assemblies are included, so adding a HintPath for compile/build doesn't affect the Skia DLLs or the paths they look up at runtime. \r\n\r\nFor reference, this is my csproj:\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Project Sdk=\"Microsoft.NET.Sdk\">\r\n\r\n  <PropertyGroup>\r\n    <TargetFramework>netstandard2.0</TargetFramework>\r\n  </PropertyGroup>\r\n\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"PowerShellStandard.Library\" Version=\"5.1.1\" PrivateAssets=\"All\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SkiaSharp\" Version=\"1.68.0\" />\r\n    <PackageReference Include=\"SkiaSharp.NativeAssets.Linux\" Version=\"1.68.0\" />\r\n  </ItemGroup>\r\n\r\n</Project>\r\n```\r\n\r\nI added the following lines to no effect (other than a build/publish time warning that they can't be found, because, well, they don't exist until after the publish is completed anyway):\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n  <ItemGroup>\r\n    <Reference Include=\"libSkiaSharp\">\r\n        <HintPath>win-x86/libSkiaSharp.dll</HintPath>\r\n        <HintPath>win-x64/libSkiaSharp.dll</HintPath>\r\n        <HintPath>osx/libSkiaSharp.dylib</HintPath>\r\n        <HintPath>linux-x64/libSkiaSharp.dylib</HintPath>\r\n    </Reference>\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom what I've read on HintPath, it doesn't seem to have any effect on what paths are searched when loading a DLL, or that DLL tries to load other DLLs for p/invoke purposes.",

We should probably document that you don't want to put native assemblies in the filelist for that reason.\r\n\r\nAppreciate the help tracking it down! For now the P/invoke solution I mentioned gives me the most flexibility, but it might be sensible to add handling for such things in module loading. \r\n\r\nFor example, let's say in PrivateData we add an entry called RuntimeLibPaths, which is a hashtable where the keys match supported platform names / architectures, and the values are the path to the folder containing the native library. The appropriate folder(s) are added to the dll search paths on import by PowerShell internally rather than having to be added by the module itself on import.",

If it's via Mono, looking at [this page](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/advanced/pinvoke/) there is actually a _bug in Mono_ on Mac OS that prevents the library load paths being properly respected...\r\n\r\nPowerShell... needs to handle this. I'm not sure there _is_ a way to handle this appropriately from all platforms from the module itself.",

    "body": "@steveL-msft that's the issue, I think. It seems to work fine elsewhere, with some caveats still. For example, loading the native lib works if it's in the same folder as the main SkiaSharp.dll, but for PS that doesn't work due to the change @adityapatwardhan mentions. That just multiplies the difficulty in the case of working with PowerShell and how it handles modules.\r\n\r\nIn most situations in working with such native libraries it can be abstracted away, because you can just package it for each supported platform anyway. We quite simply don't have that luxury for PS modules, unless I want to package and maintain three or more completely separate gallery modules, which is unfortunately really bad for discoverability and the end user experience.\r\n\r\nGiven that PS is a cross platform tool, we need some way to handle native libraries in modules, or we need some way to have the PackageManagement module recognise that there need to be separate libraries extracted on a per-platform basis from the nupkg.\r\n\r\nI'm open to alternate solutions, but it seems the deck here is pretty scarce. :confused:",

That's a _workaround_ but really we need a better fix. \r\n\r\nOn Unix systems, however, there _is no such p/invoke_ available, from what I've been able to find, and for whatever reason PowerShell isn't querying the environment variables that normally indicate which paths to search when you try to DllImport from an assembly loaded by PS.\r\n\r\nSo on basically all platforms this is... extremely unfriendly to do anything with. ðŸ˜… \r\n\r\nAs it currently stands there appears to be no other option apart from including any and all Unix native assemblies directly in the module root folder (which limits the platforms you can support, as often there can be name collisions), and then being careful about which folder you add to the search paths on Windows with the p/invoke (if you care about supporting x86 Windows -- and @TylerLeonhardt tells me that Azure Functions runs on x86 for some strange reason, so that's a necessity if you want to work with those.)",

    "body": "Sort of. This is the layout I have that currently works, but is messy as all heck. Anything I can't define a path for via p/invoke must be in the module root (which runs into name collision problems on some platforms).\r\n\r\n```\r\nPSWordCloud/\r\n|- PSWordCloudCmdlet.dll\r\n|- SkiaSharp.dll\r\n|- libSkiaSharp.so\r\n|- libSkiaSharp.dylib\r\n|- win-x86/\r\n  |- libSkiaSharp.dll\r\n|- win-x64/\r\n  |- libSkiaSharp.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\n**SkiaSharp.dll** is .NET, and is a referenced assembly for my main cmdlet dll. The four **libSkiaSharp** files are native per-platform DLLs. I don't control the code in SkiaSharp.dll, so I can't force that DLL to update the paths before it p/invokes.\r\n\r\nSo... I have a module with a .NET dependency. This dependency depends on a native library that it is loading with DllImport; the exact file is different per platform/architecture (but several of the files have name collisions, so that restricts the platforms I can actually support).\r\n\r\nUsing @rkeithhill's code, I think I can possibly move the Linux native library to a subfolder as well. Not sure about MacOS, there's probably something similar-ish, but I have yet to find any documentation on methods for that.\r\n\r\n_Ideally_, ALL of these files should be at worst in a subfolder out of the way, something like `/PSWordCloud/runtime/<platform>/` -- unfortunately, due to how PowerShell has changed the path loading specifications from the standard settings, only files in the root folder of the module can be loaded via DllImport. Other locations may work, but (at least on Mac/Linux) _all_ of the environment variables on those platforms that are supposed to define native runtime load paths are **completely** ignored by PowerShell.\r\n\r\nI believe `$env:Path` still works (though it shouldn't be using that on Unix platforms, and I haven't tested that since the 6.2 release, so that might be broken as well), but frankly I don't think it's a good idea at all to add a ton of paths to that variable, it makes for a really terrible user experience if the user needs to use that environment variable at all. You load a module, and suddenly your path variable has extra unexpected data that probably shouldn't be there, but _has_ to be there for things to work correctly.\r\n\r\nI think this should be a non-issue; PowerShell should have a more robust method of handling native library load paths if it's going to be overriding .NET Core's predefined methods. I would suggest having some way to specify a native library load path in the module manifest or something along those lines, some way to define where it should be looking per platform when something needs to p/invoke some native code.",

The module manifest could be updated to allow module authors to provide a list of native dlls per os-arch combo and then pwsh would pre-load those native dlls before it pre-loaded any assemblies.  That said, **if** someone is going to use your assembly from another language, the assembly really should pre-load its own native dlls.  The user of the assembly shouldn't have to do that IMO.\r\n\r\n@vexx32 I \"think\" `dlopen` works on macOS as well.",

But AFAICT the lib name value provided to the DllImport attribute has to be a compile time constant. :-(\r\n\r\nFWIW you can omit the extension for `DllImport`.  We do that for PSES's non-Windows [native dependency](https://github.com/SeeminglyScience/UnixConsoleEcho/blob/11a8886efdaf140514ab495266be87ed0f41312c/src/UnixConsoleEcho/InputEcho.cs#L44-L48). Doesn't help if the base names aren't the same though.\r\n\r\nYou can also probably skip the compiler directives for the `LoadLibrary`/`dlopen` calls by storing them in separate interface implementations.  As long as the method isn't JIT'd it shouldn't throw at runtime.",

It does manage to work for Windows, though, somehow.\r\n\r\nSee my WIP branch here https://github.com/vexx32/PSWordCloud/tree/FixPInvokes -- run `build.ps1` to build the module and put all the files in the right places. It'll import the module for you, too. Calling `New-WordCloud` after running the build works on Windows, but fails completely on Mac OS.\r\n\r\n@SeeminglyScience you see anything I did wrong there? :/\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/32407840?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/vexx32/PSWordCloud\">vexx32/PSWordCloud</a></strong></div><div>Create pretty word clouds with PowerShell!
