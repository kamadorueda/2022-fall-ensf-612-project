    "body": "Well, it is pretty clear from the code that whoever implemented this felt this should be a terminating error.  My guess is that this was done to support scripts where changing the execution policy setting is critical for the script to succeed.  So even if the 'policy' is successfully changed at a specific scope, but the actual state doesn't change because some other scope overrides it, then it is an error.  \r\n\r\nIt seems like it would have been better to have separate cmdlets that had clear responsibility for affecting policy and for affecting current state.  But changing this now would be a breaking change (unless we propose new cmdlets and deprecate the old).  \r\n\r\nFeel free to add the 'Review-Committee' tag if you feel this should be considered.",

    "body": "@PowerShell/powershell-committee discussed this and we we're worried about potential breaking changes in an area that's so widely depended upon by the entire ecosystem. It's likely that this try/catch has been deployed very widely, and even if the fix to work around that break is simple, it could be in unmaintained areas of automation. \r\n\r\nThe issue that's really being discussed is whether or not folks depend on (and/or expect) the behavior of Set-ExecutionPolicy to set both the scope specified *and* the process scope. @BrucePay and @JamesWTruher both raised the fact that the cmdlets were designed and communicated like this early on, as @PaulHigin intuited from the source code.\r\n\r\nWe do agree that the documentation and/or error message could be improved to be clear about the intended behavior of the cmdlet and why the error is being thrown (specifically that the Process level execution policy could not be changed). \r\n\r\nWe discussed and ultimately rejected the idea of a Switch parameter (something like a `-PolicyOnly`) as it would simply add complexity to the cmdlet with no real benefit (this is why we have GP). \r\n\r\nWe also raised that it would be useful to have some cmdlets that help set configuration values in the `powershell.config.json` so that you could easily do something like `Set-PowerShellConfigurationValue -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` and have it only be reflected in the config.
