    "body": "Well, it is pretty clear from the code that whoever implemented this felt this should be a terminating error.  My guess is that this was done to support scripts where changing the execution policy setting is critical for the script to succeed.  So even if the 'policy' is successfully changed at a specific scope, but the actual state doesn't change because some other scope overrides it, then it is an error.  \r\n\r\nIt seems like it would have been better to have separate cmdlets that had clear responsibility for affecting policy and for affecting current state.  But changing this now would be a breaking change (unless we propose new cmdlets and deprecate the old).  \r\n\r\nFeel free to add the 'Review-Committee' tag if you feel this should be considered.",

It's likely that this try/catch has been deployed very widely, and even if the fix to work around that break is simple, it could be in unmaintained areas of automation. \r\n\r\nThe issue that's really being discussed is whether or not folks depend on (and/or expect) the behavior of Set-ExecutionPolicy to set both the scope specified *and* the process scope. @BrucePay and @JamesWTruher both raised the fact that the cmdlets were designed and communicated like this early on, as @PaulHigin intuited from the source code.\r\n\r\nWe do agree that the documentation and/or error message could be improved to be clear about the intended behavior of the cmdlet and why the error is being thrown (specifically that the Process level execution policy could not be changed). \r\n\r\nWe discussed and ultimately rejected the idea of a Switch parameter (something like a `-PolicyOnly`) as it would simply add complexity to the cmdlet with no real benefit (this is why we have GP). \r\n\r\nWe also raised that it would be useful to have some cmdlets that help set configuration values in the `powershell.config.json` so that you could easily do something like `Set-PowerShellConfigurationValue -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` and have it only be reflected in the config.

Most tools that are running powershell use the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` mode on the executable itself.\r\n\r\nEven if we assume that a decent portion of folks are running the cmdlet itself where the issue occurs, for the proposed change to break something, the _environment_ itself would have to change. (Unless something is relying on _not_ being able to change the execution policy, which... seems like a contrived scenario even at the most optimistic assessment I can muster.) That being the case would be a problem regardless of whether or not this change is taken, so the only time this impacts an automation scenario is it starting to fail... which _would happen anyway_, only more severely and slightly more obviously without the proposed change.\r\n\r\nAnd that, inherently, means the code _is_ being maintained, or at least the server / other system it's on is being updated, and something is bound to break or require a bit of fixing from time to time regardless.\r\n\r\nI'm really not seeing any particular value in leaving things the way they are here, and nor do I see a lot of potential value in further complicating the executionpolicy settings. 🤷‍♂ ",
