IIRC the reasoning back then was effectively \"we shouldn't have hex parsing differ based on the type suffix\" or something along those lines. It's been a while, but that's what I can remember at the moment. The current parsing behaviour for hex literals mimics the pre-existing behaviour for parsing hex, where originally the `int.Parse()` and `long.Parse()` methods were used, which came with an implicit width restriction/assumption.\r\n\r\nGiven that yes, these will cause parse errors otherwise, I'm more than happy to go back and fix it if that's something folx want. It's certainly a more useful feature that way. ðŸ™‚ ",
