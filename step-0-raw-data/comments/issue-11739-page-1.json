    "body": "Without having looked at the source code, it seems that **only if `-` is followed by an (English) letter or `_` (notably, not a _digit_) is it interpreted as a parameter name**.\r\n\r\nThe following calls succeed, because the `-<char>` sequences are _not_ treated as parameter names (and therefore _positionally_ bind to `-bar`):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction foo { [CmdletBinding()]param($bar) \"[$bar]\" }\r\n[char[]] '~`!@#$%^*+0<>./\\[]' | % { iex \"foo -$_\" }\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that while `` ` `` works in principle, it retains its escaping function, so something like ``-`a`` rings the bell, and `` -`n `` passes `-<newline>`.\r\n\r\n[_Update_, based on your comment] Similarly, `$` is used as-is  by itself (`-$`) or if followed by a character not valid in a variable name (`-$@`); `$(...)` (`-$('hi')`) and `$<identifier>` (`-$HOME`) are treated as subexpressions / variable references, possibly followed by other literal chars / `$` constructs.\r\n\r\n(Perhaps surprisingly, given that `@` and `$` work), `{` / `}` and `(` / `)` don't work.\r\n\r\nNeither do the quoting chars., `\"` and `'`.\r\n\r\nAs you state, `-` doesn't work (`--` makes the binder treat all remaining tokens as _positional_ arguments, so that\r\n`foo -- -unknownswitch` works, for instance).\r\n\r\nNon-prefix metacharacters `,`, `;`, `|`, and `&` still have their usual meaning and also cannot be used.\r\n\r\n`-?` is intercepted and always shows help.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs an aside: Using `-%`, to form `--%`, the stop parsing symbol, is recognized as such even with additional characters immediately following it, because its special treatment of the remaining command line kicks in _instantly_.\r\n\r\nCuriously, it breaks the invocation altogether, because no arguments are then recognized anymore (granted, `--%` is for _external programs_, but the behavior is still curious):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Without --%, these would succeed.\r\nfoo --% a # fails\r\nfoo --% -bar baz # fails\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnother `--%` problem: #11608\r\n\r\n",
