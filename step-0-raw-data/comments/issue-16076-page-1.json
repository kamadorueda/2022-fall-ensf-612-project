The Principle of Least Astonishment is predicated on the fact that if you try hard enough, you can find some justification for everything after the fact.\r\n\r\nThe cmdlet's current behavior impedes the natural workflow of a system administrator because of its perverse (and definitely unintended) use of wildcards. To wit, wildcards are supposed to help select multiple files or folders, not make selecting one harder. This behavior, even if well-documented, does not lead to predictable script outcome. Rather, it acts as a form of a minefield that triggers instant-deathâ€“style failure modes to scripts when the user least expects it.",

Every time I wish to send a filename to PowerShell cmdlet, I have to use a helper function that scans the filename string for `[` and `]`. Once these characters are found, the function has to inject a number of backticks (<code>\\`</code>) depending on what cmdlet receives it. `Get-ChildItem` needs two, `Out-File` needs one! I've seen cmdlets that need three! Now, what's the justification for all this trouble imposed upon us? That in a galaxy far, far away, an app named `bash` accepts wildcards? That's extremely unfair!\r\n\r\nPlease look at this simple case of unjustified failure:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS > Get-Item *.txt | ForEach-Object { Set-Content -Value \"Test\" -Path $_.Name }\r\n```\r\n```Output\r\nSet-Content: An object at the specified path [AuthorName] Book 1.txt does not exist,\r\nor has been filtered by the -Include or -Exclude parameter.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the script developer has no immediate visibility into the $_.Name, this comes as a complete shock. Even with visibility, they need to know that PowerShell doesn't resolve the `[` and `]` at the parser level.\r\n\r\nI am open to the suggestion that perhaps you and the PowerShell Committee have a style guide regarding how to script safely and bracket-consciously, but I'm not sure if they are documented anywhere.",
