    "body": "FWIW it seems like pattern matching on a merged stream of `RunspaceAvailabilityChanged` and `StateChanged` events can be used to infer when a runspace is ready for use.  There seems to be two characteristic streams depending on whether modules are specified in `InitialSessionState.Modules`.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic event streams seem to be as shown below.  The last event mentioned in the respective stream seems to indicate that the runspace is ready for use.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nNo Modules Specified\r\n\r\nRunspaceAvailability RunspaceStateInfo\r\n-------------------- -----------------\r\n                     Opening          \r\nAvailable                             \r\n                     Opened           \r\n```\r\n\r\n```none\r\nModules Specified\r\n\r\nRunspaceAvailability RunspaceStateInfo \r\n-------------------- ----------------- \r\n                     Opening           \r\nAvailable                              \r\n                     Opened            \r\nBusy                                   \r\nAvailable                              \r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know how robust this method is, but it's the best method I have found for getting a signal when a runspace is ready for use.  I've also found that having such a signal is critical for achieving speedup by utilizing multiple processors when executing CPU-bound PowerShell.",
