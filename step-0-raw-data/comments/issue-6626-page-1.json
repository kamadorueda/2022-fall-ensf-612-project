    "body": "@BrucePay I can't speak to @mtman's intentions, but I can explain my thinking there.\r\n\r\nIMO, the JSON serialization and deserialzation PowerShell should be the same across all uses. In this case, we would serialize objects the same way we do with `ConvertTo-Json`. If we used `-JsonBody` as the parameter for this, then these 2 should be functionally equivalent:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Result1 = Invoke-WebRequest $uri -Method POST -Body ($object | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType 'application/json'\r\n$Result2 = Invoke-WebRequest $uri -Method POST -JsonBody $object\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, we shouldn't use a different implementation for JSON serialization as someone would reasonably expect those to be functionally equivalent. This gets tricky. Sometimes you want to preserve the looping nature of objects and other times you do not. I don't believe there is currently any way to disable looping in the JSON Cmdlets. The only mechanism currently available is to limit the depth. But even if we did have the mechanism to prevent looping, we would be making a judgement call on behalf of the user on this parameter, that's probably not a good idea.\r\n\r\nI understood the request as making the behavior functionally equivalent to this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Result3 = Invoke-WebRequest $uri -Method POST -Body ($object | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 99) -ContentType 'application/json'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is problematic for the following: `$Object = Get-Acl c:\\`. We also don't know what depth to stop at if the user supplies a sufficiently deep object (even without looping).\r\n\r\nParallel to this problem is the assumption of object types for JSON submission. A hashtable translates to a JSON Object. However, single value JSON literals (bools, ints, floats, strings) and JSON Arrays are also valid JSON to submit to endpoints.\r\n\r\nUltimately, as much as I would like to make it easy to submit a PowerShell Object as JSON without using `ConvertTo-Json`, I think it's probably best to keep to \"do one thing\" and let the JSON Cmdlets handle the the conversion/serialization separately from the Web Cmdlets. I would hate to keep the web cmdlets coupled with changes in the JSON cmdlets and I would not think an opinionated implementation would result in a good UX. \r\n\r\nOn the possible use of a `[json]` type accelerator, I think this is backwards from `[xml]`. The XML type accelerator is working on a string and transforming it into an object. We could look at something similar for JSON, but it would would like xml in that it deserializes a JSON string to an object. What the cmdlet here needs is to serialize an object into JSON string. It's maybe something to consider, but the serialization and deserialization are not always straight forward so whatever we implemented would have an opinionated default behavior.\r\n\r\nOn parameter aliases, I'm good with making the common ones simpler and easier to use on interactive sessions... especially since we have so many and some of them are long.\r\n\r\nOn the automatic scheme, I'm pretty sure that already works as requested:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Result4 = Invoke-WebRequest 'google.com'\r\n$Result4.BaseResponse.RequestMessage.RequestUri.Scheme\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould be `http`.",

    "body": "> Aliases in script text is bad. Aliases in interactive session don't make sense due to the IntelliSense.\r\n\r\nAliases are very different than Intellisense because they are short and don't require iteration. In case of scripts, the common problem is positional arguments. If those script writers adopt aliases instead, the tooling can replace it with full names, which cannot be done with positional args (they are not unique across all parameter sets).\r\n\r\nPros: \r\n- Writing and reading is short and confident\r\n- CLI history is clear and easy to navigate\r\n- Helps replace positional args with full parameter names in scripts\r\n- Easy adoption when coming from Curl\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n?\r\n\r\n\r\n@BrucePay, @markekraus I didn't consider looping. I think it's a very rare use case for RESTful queries. However, there is a coherent way to improve JSON serialization in general. `ConvertTo-Json` can have a `-CircularDetection` accepting `Depth` (default), `Enable`, `Disable`. Web Cmdlets should always use `Enable`. Once it detects a circular reference, it throws an exception alongside a hint to use `ConvertTo-Json` for more options. I think JSON.NET works similarly.\r\n\r\nIf a breaking change for `ConvertTo-Json` is not an issue, the default can be `Enable`. And since it already fails silently once the default depth (2 or 3) is reached, I wouldn't mind to break the behavior at all.\r\n\r\nGood point on auto scheme and primitive types. `-JsonBody` should accept `object` and act just like `ConvertTo-Json` (considering the above).\r\n\r\nThe key issue is that in case of REST APIs, JSON seems to be the default body format instead of forms. Take the default ASP.NET Core project as an example. It automatically converts a JSON body, but fails for forms.\r\n",

    "body": "> If 2 out of 40+ APIs you work with require that, I think that counts as quite rare \r\n\r\nSure, if it wasn't for the fact that those 2 APIs have a higher usage than many others, with some getting less than 10 calls a month. *shrugs\r\n\r\n> That's just the general way to achieve any simplification. As long as there is a simple and logical way to opt out, I don't see how that's bad UX.\r\n\r\nHow deep do we set it? why? how do we make the user aware of that? Do we block looping or not? How do we communicate that to the user? \r\n\r\nIt's just that JSON is not as simple as many make it out to be. As I said, when you start to use a large number of APIs you come into issues with just how limiting the current implementation is. Adding a even more limited and opinionated implementation directly on a cmdlet that is focused on processing web content, not web submissions, and coupling the cmdlet further with another API is bad design with a bad UX.\r\n\r\nIf the Object to JSON serialization was clear and singular, I would not be opposed to adding it as another body type. But since we would need to add multiple flags to deal with the serialization to meet the 80% use cases, it makes less sense to included it.\r\n\r\n\r\n> So the issue occurs only when used with a port:\r\n\r\nI believe that is `by design`. When you specify a port, you must specify a scheme because you are being explicit which indicates you do not with to use defaults. you specify \"google.com:443\" and the recommendation would be to prepend that with `http`. What if I need `https` over `80`? Maybe `ftp`? Not sure it makes sense to change it... and if we did.. I would probably prefer HTTPS as the default.\r\n \r\n",
