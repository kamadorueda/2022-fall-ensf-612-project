Are you refering to [this .net repo](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime) as the one providing the New-SelfSignedCertificate cmdlet ? \r\nJust asking for confirmation, because I can't find this cmdlet in the code over there. So I am not sure that I can ask them the exact same question. Actually I can't find a repo that provides the `pkiclient` module altogether. But maybe it is not open source or I don't know where/how to look for it.",
