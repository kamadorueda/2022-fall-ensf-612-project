If so then I don't see a problem as the functionality is still available and usable. if the module has to be downloaded and installed separately then that will cause problems.  \r\n\r\nCIM is incredibly useful on Windows, in practice it doesn't exist on other platforms, so anything that made it harder to use would have a big impact on Windows administrators. From the dashboard the majority of PowerShell usage is Linux based - mainly I suspect because Windows PowerShell is still available. if you want PowerShell to be viewed as a viable alternative to Windows PowerShell  the CIM functionality must be easily accessible and usable",
