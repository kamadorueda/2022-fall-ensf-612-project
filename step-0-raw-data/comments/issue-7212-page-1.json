    "body": "I was logged [an issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/issues/31016) when I noticed this behavior when using Azure Storage File Shares with a Windows Container flavored App Service. The problem stems in InitializeDefaultDrives failing, but the operating system mounted drive is mountable with New-PSDrive manually even though I.D.D. fails. \r\n\r\nThe guts of the problem seem to be that there is an [#ifdef UNIX](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/06391330533c65b464e0c5a62bc3303564ccd324/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L993) put in place for the FileSystemProvider when running on Unix/Linux that bypasses the problem of auto mounting azure file shares in Cloud Shell pwsh (which always runs on Unix now), but now that the App Service guys have added preliminary support for mounting storage file shares in Windows Containers, remoting into the container with pwsh gives a new context for this issue. \r\n\r\n```c#\r\n                        if (newDrive.DriveType == DriveType.Network)\r\n                        {\r\n                            // Platform notes: This is important because certain mount\r\n                            // points on non-Windows are enumerated as drives by .NET, but\r\n                            // the platform itself then has no real network drive support\r\n                            // as required by this context. Solution: check for network\r\n                            // drive support before using it.\r\n#if UNIX\r\n                            continue;\r\n#else\r\n                            displayRoot = GetRootPathForNetworkDriveOrDosDevice(newDrive);\r\n#endif\r\n``` \r\n\r\nSo the problem is now the _#else_ clause is running in this new container/docker context with a Windows base OS and an Azure Storage File Share because while `[System.IO.DriveInfo]::GetDrives()` returns the file share mounted drive, the code path for `GetRootPathForNetworkDriveOrDosDevice` blows up.\r\n\r\nI guess we need some new runtime logic to harden this latter path from Azure file share pseudo network drives.
