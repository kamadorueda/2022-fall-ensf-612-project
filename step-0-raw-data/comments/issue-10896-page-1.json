Then if you are in dev mode, `Add-AppxPackage` should install it locally to test.~~ Looks like `Add-AppxPackage` requires the msix to be signed.  In anycase, reading about this config in the manifest it seems that it's for apps that require elevation at launch time?",

Maybe the Windows team can add a registry key option to bring the native 'Run as Admin' menu into the main taskbar menu on right-click, which would benefit quite a few other application users like e.g. Visual Studio",
