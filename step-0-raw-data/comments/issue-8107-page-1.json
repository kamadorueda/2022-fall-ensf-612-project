    "body": "I implemented this feature as a proof-of-concept for myself a few months ago, but haven't polished it or added tests. (Happy to contribute the changes, but they're definitely not PR-ready.)\r\n\r\nObservations:\r\n\r\n* The most straightforward way to implement this request is to modify VerifyHashTable in MshParameter.cs, which affects Select-Object, Format-Table, Format-List, Format-Custom, Form. (\"Yes\" to @iSazonov re: Format-*, but needs some design decisions)\r\n* It feels much nicer to use than the current syntax, especially Select-Object and Sort-Object. (e.g. `gci | sort [ordered]@{Extension='d'; Length='a'; {$_.Name[-1]}='d'}`)\r\n* Even more convenient would be syntax for KeyValuePair literals. (Almost certainly a breaking change though, and abbreviated hashtable syntax is better than what exists today.)\r\n\r\nComplications:\r\n\r\n* It's necessary to use `[ordered]@{...}` instead of just `@{...}`. Otherwise the properties don't appear in the expected order, or even worse, sorting works unexpectedly.\r\n* The Format-* cmdlets have more than two useful parameters, and it's unclear how best to express more than Name & Expression in an abbreviated form. Some potential options:\r\n\r\n  1. `gci | ft @{SizeInBytes='Length', '#,0', 'right'; SecondsOld = {([datetime]::UtcNow-$_.LastWriteTimeUtc).TotalSeconds}, '#,0', 'right'; LastModified='LastWriteTime', 'yyyy-mm-dd'}`\r\n  2. Allow Name=Value and apply the other parameters across: `gci | ft @{SizeInBytes='Length'; SecondsOld={([datetime]::UtcNow-$_.LastWriteTimeUtc).TotalSeconds}; f='#,0'; a='right'}, @{LastModified='LastWriteTime'; f='yyyy-mm-dd'}`\r\n  3. Only allow Name=Value: `gci | ft @{SizeInBytes='Length'; SecondsOld={([datetime]::UtcNow-$_.LastWriteTimeUtc).TotalSeconds}}, @{LastModified='LastWriteTime'}`\r\n\r\n* Error reporting is more difficult, because it's ambiguous which format was the user attempting to use. (My implementation doesn't try to analyze what went wrong with the short-form parameters, and just throws the error raised by the long-form interpretation.)\r\n\r\nRelated, helpful potential changes:\r\n\r\n* Implicitly parse hashtable arguments as ordered hashtables. (Otherwise `sort` will be unpredictable, and the others will have out-of-order properties)\r\n* Format-Html should use ExpressionEntryDefinition, AlignmentEntryDefinition, and WidthEntryDefinition instead of defining its own HashtableEntryDefinition.\r\n* Enhance CommandParameterDefinition and/or HashtableEntryDefinition to indicate mutually exclusive parameters and (optional) parameter validation. Otherwise the modifications to VerifyHashTable will be brittle / hard-coded / hackish, e.g. relying on the subclass of `HashtableEntryDefinition`. (Currently `CommandParameterDefinition` is just a light helper wrapper around list of parameters and their accepted types.)\r\n* Make the `MshParameter` mechanism public, to allow functions to use the functionality.",

    "body": "@HumanEquivalentUnit, thanks for linking my issue.\r\n(Although, I searched for an already similar request, I didn't came across this one.)\r\nThe idea is indeed almost the same, it slightly differs in a sense that it isn't relying on the order of the property attributes but on the (implicit) property attribute type. Meaning that e.g. a the calculated expression should be an explicit `[Expression]` type, or an implicit `[ScriptBlock]` (based constructor of the expression class):\r\n\r\nTaking @bstrautin example:  \r\n<sub>(using the powershell wrappers from #11866)</sub>\r\n\r\n**Implicit syntax:**\r\n```PowerShell\r\ngci | ft2 @{\r\n\tSizeInBytes = {$_.Length}, '#,0', 'right'\r\n\tSecondsOld = {([datetime]::UtcNow-$_.LastWriteTimeUtc).TotalSeconds}, '#,0', 'right'\r\n\tLastModified = {$_.LastWriteTime}, 'yyyy-mm-dd'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Explicit syntax:**\r\n```PowerShell\r\ngci | ft2 @{\r\n\tSizeInBytes = [Expression]'Length', [FormatString]'#,0', [Alignment]'right'\r\n\tSecondsOld = [Expression]{([datetime]::UtcNow-$_.LastWriteTimeUtc).TotalSeconds}, [FormatString]'#,0', [Alignment]'right'\r\n\tLastModified = [Expression]'LastWriteTime', [FormatString]'yyyy-mm-dd'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage is that the concerned property attribute classes need to be predefined. At the other hand, this could also be turned into an advantage if the properties attributes could be attached to the concerned object properties to be used as a default behavior for the related cmdlet as `Format-Table ` and `Sort-Object`.\r\n\r\nI am not sure what I should do with my request #11866, close it?\r\n",
