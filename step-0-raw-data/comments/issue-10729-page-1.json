    "body": "@jiasli it seems that the behavior is consistent between PowerShell and cmd and that python is setting the console foregroundcolor.  In which case, it seems that the shell should not simply set it back.\r\n\r\n```cmd\r\npython color.py > out\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen redirecting either in PowerShell or cmd, the foreground color (as well as the background color) is changed to black.  A user using a native command that changes the console colors should be respected.  Looks like colorama is calling the win32 api SetConsoleTextAttribute and probably not setting it back correctly.",
