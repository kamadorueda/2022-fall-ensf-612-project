(I stopped developing it when the product was discontinued.)\r\n\r\nIf you look in the tests (which I tried to closely follow the approaches with [DscResource.Tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests)), you'll see that I wasn't mocking classes, but rather mocking cmdlets that the classes called.\r\n\r\nSidenote: I'm not sure I fully understand the need to mock classes in the DSC Resource context? Unless you're trying to mock a [$this.Get()](https://github.com/ryanspletzer/ServiceBusForWindowsServerDsc/blob/dev/DSCClassResources/SBFarm/SBFarm.psm1#L487) call from the Test() method, but still, in that case, I was able to work around it by mocking the cmdlets the Get() method called to produce the desired result.\r\n\r\nThat said, obviously, the ability to do class mocking in general, even outside of DSC, will be helpful regardless.\r\n\r\nI bought into the promise and the hopeful simplicity of class-based DSC resources with WMF 5.1, and viewed them as the future even then (because Microsoft was saying that they were the future at that point already), and I still think they're a great idea. \r\n\r\nThat said, at that time little info was available on them and I had to dig into the bowels of how Microsoft structured their modules and their class-based DSC resources like WindowsPackageCab (take a look at `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\\PSDesiredStateConfiguration\\DSCClassResources\\WindowsPackageCab`).\r\n\r\nInterestingly [xWindowsPackageCab in xPSDesiredStateConfiguration](https://github.com/dsccommunity/xPSDesiredStateConfiguration/blob/master/source/DSCResources/DSC_xWindowsPackageCab/DSC_xWindowsPackageCab.psm1) is no longer a class-based resource? (Or was there ever a class-based version in the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration module? I tried looking back in history a bit and I don't think it was.)\r\n\r\nI'm curious if there are other class-based DSC resources out there today? (I'm not aware of a way to search the PS gallery for class-based resources specifically.)",

At the same time though, if the best practice becomes to use class methods as little as possible so that your resource is testable, a class only design may not be the right choice.\r\n\r\nAgreed!\r\n\r\n> I'm also just generally uncomfortable with improving a general feature _specifically_ so that DSC can utilize it. Historically when that happens, we get features that are just _barely_ enough to be great in DSC but often quite broken everywhere else. I understand that feature development needs demonstrable value and DSC is a good source of that. I just ask that the history of tunnel vision taken into account by whoever takes on these improvements.\r\n\r\nI would like to see the improvement so I can mock classes in DSC *and* elsewhere. :) DSC would benefit but I think the language would benefit, too. The general class concept is helpful in more places than just DSC, IMO.\r\n\r\nThough, we'd also be in this interesting state where we'll be able to mock classes on PS 7.2+ but not on down versions, so they'll be testable in, say, PS 7.2 for correctness, but your execution environment may still be Windows PS 5.1. In theory, the class should execute the same... In theory.\r\n\r\n5.1 is slowly becoming the IE 11 of PowerShell -- have to write things for the lowest common denominator that's in the box, because if you're making a script generally available you don't know who will be running it where. These days I tend to write scripts that target the latest PS Core and 5.1 and handle the quirks between the two (and occasionally across platforms).\r\n\r\nIf you *didn't* go 100% class-based, I'd foresee a scenario where people are maintaining schema mof and json files both for max compat on 5.1 and 7.2+. (Perhaps with some automated translator from json to mof -- IMHO json is a friendlier format than mof and I don't anticipate people having issues with maintaining in json and using a utility script to convert to mof.)\r\n\r\nAnd if you do go 100% class-based, obviously we're talking re-writes across the board, especially from a lot of resource modules maintained by Microsof themselves. (A tool to help convert script resources to class resources is one thing. However, converting unit and integration tests... much trickier.)\r\n\r\nAnd regardless of 100% class-based or not, in some scenarios people are going to have to wrangle with win-specific cmdlets like Get-EventLog and explicitly using Import-WinModule from the WindowsCompatibility module when they're in PS 7.2+.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI want to be clear that, though I wrote a module with class-based resources, please don't consider it an endorsement of class-based DSC resources. To be honest, they were *challenging* to develop when I started that module in 2016. (And this is coming from someone who writes C# -- it wasn't challenging due to a lack of understanding of class concepts, in fact I liked that it was going this direction.) It made sense at the time since that seemed like \"the future\" (and who wants to develop a brand new module on an approach that might become deprecated), and it seemed like avoiding hand-editing schema mof files would be a nice benefit (though that will get better with JSON I'm guessing), but that did not mean it was easy by any stretch.\r\n\r\nThe challenges then mostly revolved around DSCResources.Tests not being quite caught up to the concept of class-based resources (though it seems to have gotten better, see https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/pull/75, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/pull/76, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/pull/64, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/118, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/pull/119, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/149, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/pull/150, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/issues/173, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/pull/212, https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Tests/pull/200), and also sorting through new [cryptic errors](https://github.com/ryanspletzer/ServiceBusForWindowsServerDsc/commit/74cd3d5df780bfb5595e37c519463250e3dd4d93) in DSC that classes brought into the fold. I almost considered switching the project back over away from classes at the time because it seemed like it wasn't ready.\r\n\r\nI don't think I was alone, either: It looks based on looking at some of those referenced issues / PR's that SqlServerDsc at one point tried to move towards class-based resources and then went back to script-based resources, see this slice in time compared to current: https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/tree/21411fd562d8fd2eee43942fa5f86c1d89e0071c\r\n\r\nThis exchange in particular is interesting and related to that, and interestingly also sheds more light on why WindowsPackageCab went back to script-based resource with schema mof: https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/673#issuecomment-314591255\r\n\r\nI'm torn because I really want class-based to work because of the simplicity of not having to have a schema mof (or json) file, but the approach didn't seem to get quite the uptick that was hoped for when it was first introduced. I think in order for it to get uptick in usage in the future, the core issues of why it wasn't picked up in the first place have to be fully understood and addressed.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/51456978?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc\">dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc</a></strong></div><div>This module contains DSC resources for deployment and configuration of Microsoft SQL Server. - dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc</div></blockquote>",

    "body": "### Question\r\nDoes this change mean that the composite resources will no longer work?\r\nComposite resources are sort of like a sugar-coated syntax, and it seems inherently difficult to replace them with class-based resources.\r\n\r\n### Impression\r\nI've created a lot of DSC resources, but they are mostly script-based. I've never created a class-based resource, so I'm sure I can do it, but it's going to be a struggle.\r\n\r\nAnother concern is what to do with old resources that are useful but have stopped development. I'll have to decide whether to find a replacement written in a class-based or create one myself, neither of which will be easy.",
