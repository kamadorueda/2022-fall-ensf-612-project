Make Include/Exclude and Depth mutually exclusive. Not intuitive, but at least the user will get an error rather than unexpected results.\r\n2. Adjust the cmdlet so that using these combinations of parameters works as one would expect them to.\r\n\r\nI'd say the second one is more desirable, but I'm approaching this from a high-level as a user so I don't fully appreciate the amount of work or if it would result in any breaking changes.",
