I am really surprised that more people do not use UNC paths, but I suppose even 'nix users utilize mount points (links) instead of UNC paths.\r\n\r\nI relocated the clone of the repository to a local drive, and let the install-dotnet script run there, but I suspect that the install-dotnet script would have worked in a UNC path, but didn't try it.  I could try it, and if it works, I think I could suggest a solution to the install-dotnet function that would allow for calling Windows PowerShell with the install-dotnet script path.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/9140e421eceeef9d92cf671cc6aaa0782ea343cd/build.psm1#L1540\r\n\r\n`$fullDotnetInstallPath = (Join-Path -Path $pwd.Path -ChildPath $installScript) -replace '^[^:]*::', ''`\r\n",
