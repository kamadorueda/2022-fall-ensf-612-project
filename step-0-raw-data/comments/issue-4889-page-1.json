    "body": "This is not quite a dup of 3931 as it's not exclusively about wildcard expansion and quoting. The command `cd /sys/devices/pci0000:00/` should work but it fails because we're treating everything before the colon as a drive name. To fix this, we should probably restrict the set of characters allowed in drive names to be alphanumeric (a breaking change but necessary I think for *nix platforms). Also, the default drive for the file system on *nix is '/' which can't actually be used e.g. `ls /:` doesn't work. We should change it to be a \"real\" drive name like `root:` or some such.",

Based on the `cd` example above, it appears that the code just scans the string until it hits a colon. Restricting the drive name to alphanumerics would cover a lot of cases (e.g. the cd above) but not your specific one. Prefixing with ./ is one workaround e.g. `cd ./pci0000:00` or you could specify the actual drive `cd root:pci0000:00` (assuming we pre-created a drive \"root\" of the file system instead of '/' which can't actually be used.) Note: New-PSDrive won't let you create a drive with any of `; ~ / \\ . :` in the name but we apparently aren't universal in our checks.",
