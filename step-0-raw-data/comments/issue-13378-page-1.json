    "body": "Thank you @mkht ; not that I understand why this would be an improvement over the old format, but at least it explains the behavior. It cost me over a day to find out why a script that talks to an API did work on PS 5.1, but failed on PS 7.0. \r\nThe script authenticates to the API, which returns a token in a header. When using the returned array of string to set the value of a token header for subsequent calls to the API (together with a session variable), Invoke-WebRequest apparently did not convert the headers to a normal string, and the API returned HTTP 401/Unauthorized. I had to convert the token into a normal string manually using -join before the API accepted the token header. Is this a shortcoming of the API or should Invoke-WebRequest convert the array of strings before sending it to the server?\r\nIn other words, I really don't have a clue why having an array of characters (because that is what is returned now) over a normal string, is a benefit. Can someone elaborate on this?",
