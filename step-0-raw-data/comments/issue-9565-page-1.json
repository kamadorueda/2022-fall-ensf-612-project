Let's me give you a more detailed response.\r\n\r\nIn corporate environment, for my customers who want to have a full support from Microsoft Premier, my advice for a massive deployment is to wait PowerShell Core is part of Windows (and by consequence updated throught WSUS / SCCM, declared to AMSI, GPO implemented , firewall rules declared for PSRemoting). This is the bare minimum for them to be reassuring.\r\n\r\nAs I see it, some old Microsoft customers have a particular mindset and this situation is a consequence of  years of lobbying against FOSS ... So don't think it will change until a moment.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the issue is around  integration in Windows, not PowerShell by itself.",

I don't see any point in *not* updating it via Microsoft Update.\r\n\r\nThat way:\r\n - updates are found easily without searching on web sites for new releases\r\n - the administrator can see whether all PCs and servers are on a patched version\r\n - updates can be installed without logging onto each PC to start an update (normal user accounts shouldn't have admin permissions) or trying to automate it with GPO startup scripts\r\n\r\nI would like to use the new PowerShell Core, but without a proper update management I won't install it in our environment. Not every user is a DevOp that updates his own PC.\r\n\r\nI just saw that on linux, Powershell can be installed by apt-get: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7#ubuntu-1804\r\nI assume that updates will also be found by apt-get update?\r\n\r\n_Why are updates for a Microsoft product easier on linux than on Windows?_\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/media/logos/logo-ms-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux\">Installing PowerShell Core on Linux - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>Information about installing PowerShell Core on various Linux distributions</div></blockquote>",

How do I ensure that it is properly patched? We use SCCM but could use Windows Update or WSUS. I prefer the upgrades and updates to come through those channels.",
