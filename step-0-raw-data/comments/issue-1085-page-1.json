PSReadLine's default edit mode is Windows style, where Ctrl-D is unbound.\n\nI believe this is what you're seeing. Set your edit mode to Emacs (`Set-PSReadlineOption -EditMode Emacs`), and you'll have the more Bash-like experience where Ctrl-D is bound to `DeleteCharOrExit`.\n\nSo this is supported, and it's just user preference.\n",
