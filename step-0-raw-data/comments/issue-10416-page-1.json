    "body": "> The 8% and 80%, what are they improving on? (what are you comparing with?) The pwsh startup time?\r\n\r\nSorry. I measured with BenchmarkDotNet only the .CPL related code. So as I mentioned we really don't see pwsh startup improvements - it is only code cleanup. I don't know how measure impact of each code pitch so I have to write my code and compare with current code. Here we get very small perf win. I pull my code only because it looks more simple and clean and also it states that we review the code pitch.\r\n\r\n> I'm confused by this statement. Can you please reword your PR description a bit to make it more clear?\r\n\r\nMain perf win in the code path (I mean AutomationEngine() ) is fixed in #10401 - there we exclude some extra file operations that is ~10 ms perf win. But there still is extra SetSessionStateDrive method call - we remove this in the PR that will be ~1ms perf win.\r\n",
