I would not have thought in life that it could be due to something so banal.\r\n\r\nBut then I still do not understand, and maybe you can also say something about it, why this occurs exclusively with publish. If I, as described above, compiled the project normally within Visual Studio, then I could execute it without further ado. I would just be interested to know why this always worked then.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help on this!",
