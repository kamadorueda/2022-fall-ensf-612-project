    "body": "I having written dozens of completers myself since @lzybkr  provided TabExpansion++ for V3. (later using Register-ArgumentCompleter and then using classes). \r\nBreaking a decade's worth of completers would be a problem, but well written completers DON'T return strings, but `CompletionResult` object and the example relies on a string being converted to one automatically.  \r\nAn **extra constructor** for completion results which took a string and a boolean for \"auto quote\" would make life easier for people writing completers properly, (`[`CompletionResult`]::new($string)` **can't change current behavior**)  but that doesn't solve the specific case here. \r\n\r\nLogic which says when converting from a string (and no other type) AND the string isn't already wrapped in quotes AND it contains a space or  ' ;  # etc it should be wrapped - that would work. I think it is possible to identify classes of strings which would break, and fixing something which pulls up a list of surnames and breaks the command line because author never allowed for O'Neill (to make this personal) might be a good thing. \r\nIt would break completers which use a string to provide a set of value, eg `select` expands to \"First\", \"First, last\" ,\"First, Last, Address\", \"First, Age\" etc   but I don't think that is common.  Completers are sufficiently valuable (in my view) that if a change led to more being written, at the cost of breaking this [mis]use case, that might be acceptable. \r\n",
