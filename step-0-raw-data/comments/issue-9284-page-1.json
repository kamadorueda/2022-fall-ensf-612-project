That would be more like CTX: http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Std/ctx/ctx.htm\r\n\r\nThere is a secondary standard which uses an escape character instead e.g. backslash before the newline; a bit like unix pipe delimited files. However this is not supposed to be mixed with quoted fields. i.e. you either quote or escape. A lot of csv parsers don't handle the quoted version though (they only handle the RFC4180 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).\r\n\r\nIf you are asking about converting the newlines to something else e.g. \\r\\n then, no there is nothing standard about this. That is outside the scope of CSV since really it depends on the reader and writer of these files. Given PowerShell is such a good toolbelt then we could be looking to read and write csv written by many other applications as long as it conforms to RFC4180. Handling escapes would be nice but extra.",
