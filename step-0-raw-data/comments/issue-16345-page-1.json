    "body": "There are two things you haven't tried with respect to suppressing `non-terminating` errors: setting `$ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'` which I don't recommend doing at the script level and suppressing non-terminating errors at the command level via the common parameter `-ErrorAction`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nri nonexistant -ea SilentlyContinue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will still store error info in the `$Error` collection so if you need to, you can inspect the error later.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS> $Error[0]\r\n\r\nRemove-Item: Cannot find path 'C:\\Users\\Keith\\PSSupport\\nonexistant' because it does not exist.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you do not even want the error stored in `$Error` use:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nri nonexistant -ea Ignore\r\n```\r\nBy and large, PowerShell commands generate non-terminating errors for common errors like \"file doesn't exist\".  However for those commands that generate terminating errors, there is no way around using `try/catch`.   Well, except for using a trap statement at the top of your script that ignores all terminating errors - again not something I'd actually \"recommend\" doing:\r\n```powershell\r\n& { trap {\"ignoring $_\"} throw \"kaboom\"; \"success\" }\r\n\r\nignoring kaboom\r\nsuccess\r\n```",
