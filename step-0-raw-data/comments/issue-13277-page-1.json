We think they clearly are appropriate in different scenarios. Changes in this PR will not only result in conflicts in other existing PRs, but also raise disputes in future contributions because people will continue to use `== null` and argue for it. So we decided to revert this PR.\r\n\r\nTo make it work better in future, @TravisEz13 submitted https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13321 to add an action to label the size of a PR. Large size PRs would require a vote of the maintainers to accept.\r\n\r\nAlso, @iSazonov it would be great if you can join our maintainer meetings, which happens every two weeks. @adityapatwardhan will chat with you about it and decide the time that works for all of us.",

A contributor shouldn't be forced to choose the pattern matching over the conventional `!=/==` when comparing to null. I don't think this is a style that we should forcefully enforce in this code base. Has dotnet/runtime repo changed all `!=/== null` to the `is/is not null` pattern matching style?\r\n\r\nAs for the `op_Equality` implementations that didn't handle `null` correctly, I would personally argue `!=/==` is better in terms of revealing those bugs :) So, you can see that this is pretty subjective, and I don't think we should enforce a rule on a case like this.",

If we wait for a bug to show up even when there's a clear way to avoid it ever becoming a concern, I think that's cause for concern.

I really hope not.\r\n\r\nJust because a tool is new and it would be some amount of work to move to it doesn't mean it's not worth using.\r\n\r\nAdditional food for thought:\r\n\r\n- [`is null` provides compile-time type safety against value type comparisons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40676426/what-is-the-difference-between-x-is-null-and-x-null#:~:text=There%20is%20in%20fact%20a,%3D%3D%20operator%20if%20it%20exists.)\r\n- [Blogpost by Jaxx](https://www.gullberg.tk/blog/is-null-versus-null-in-c/) - it's frankly annoying to debug such issues, and `is null` never needs to call potentially expensive methods to do the comparison.\r\n- [Some direct comparisons](https://intellitect.com/check-for-null-not-null/)\r\n",

Blindly changing all `==/!= null` to `is/is not null` is essentially a breaking change -- in order to tolerate a hypothetical custom type whose `op_Equality` handles `null` incorrectly, _which by the way doesn't work correctly with any existing version of PowerShell so far_, you choose to break another hypothetical custom type whose `op_Equality` intentionally handles `null` in the way that works with existing versions of PowerShell.\r\n\r\nIf a custom type doesn't handle `==/!= null` correctly, then it's a bug of that type/library and it should be fixed in that library. I don't think we should instead ask a tool to tolerate the bug of that library. And if you want that custom type to really work with PowerShell properly, then it has to fix the `null` handling anyway because otherwise it won't work in PS 7.0 and PS 5.1.",

I have a really hard time thinking of a situation where it would be genuinely useful to return `true` when the LHS is a concrete object.  We don't even do that with `AutomationNull` because you still need to tell the difference between `null` and `autonull`, hell `PSObject` doesn't even implement `op_Equality`.\r\n\r\nIs there a big risk of a bad `op_Equality` implementation in a type this repo directly references? Nah, not really.  Risk is pretty small all things considered.  That said it is still a pretty clear benefit (no matter how small) over `== null`.  If your argument was \"I understand the benefits but they're too small to outweigh the comfort level I have with `== null`\" then I probably wouldn't have popped into this thread.  I wouldn't agree but 🤷 it's low enough impact that that's not an outrageous statement.\r\n",
