    "body": "Do you have a `global.json` file in the root of the repo?  It's contents should specify that PowerShell currently uses the 2.0.0 version of the SDK.  The gist is that the presence of this file should cause `dotnet --version` to return `2.0.0` **if** that command is run within the repo dir structure.  From that code snippet, I can't tell which dir the command is run from.  I suspect the dir isn't being set to the repo path which would cause this problem.\r\n\r\nTry this, cd into your local PowerShell repo and run `dotnet --version`.  What version do you get?",

It seemed there was an update to the \"Server 2016+VS2107\" image we are using in AppVeyor. The new image has dotnet installed in `Program Files`, and caused `Start-PSBuild` to stop working. Then we merged the PR #5118 and the CI started to work again. I guess that was because the dotnet installed at `Program Files` has both 2.0.2 and 2.0.0 installed (need to verify it myself).",

We don't make any statements regarding the dotnet host being able to find the SDK in the default location that the install script installs the SDK.\r\nAlso note that if you use the install script, the expectation is that you will run dotnet.exe from where the script installed the SDK, and the host will find the SDK that is sitting right next to it.\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that this is likely to work correctly the first time the user bootstraps the build env as the install-dotnet script adds the download path (user's appdata dir) to the PowerShell process's path.  After that session is closed, the user is at the mercy of what they have officially installed AFAICT because the build script is executing `dotnet ` as in `dotnet --version`, `dotnet restore`, etc.  There is no attempt to use the version of dotnet that the bootstrapper installed.  This seems a bit perilous.  \r\n\r\nOne option is to use the install-dotnet script to install into `$env:ProgramFiles\\dotnet` (on Windows) but would require elevation.  Another option is to configure `$dotnet` as a path to the executable where that path is under the user's app data folder.  Finally, you could try setting `$env:MULTI_LEVEL_LOOKUP=\"false\"` but I'm still a little fuzzy as to what that actually does.",

Start-PSBuild -Clean\r\n```\r\nThe problem is that the `precheck` method is looking for **any** `dotnet` in the path.  In this case, it finds the `dotnet` in `C:\\Program Files\\dotnet` which is not able to see the SDK that was just downloaded. \r\n\r\nThis can be fixed by having `Find-Dotnet` first check to see if dotnet is in the current path and if so, does it have the required SDK version.  If it does then we use it.  Mostly likely this dotnet is the global dotnet in which case we avoided installing dotnet when it doesn't need to be installed.  \r\n\r\nMore importantly though, we don't settle on a version of dotnet (global) that doesn't have the required SDK.  In the case the globally installed dotnet doesn't have the required SDK, we **prepend** the user's local path for dotnet.  If we can't find dotnet or the required SDK in the user's local dotnet dir, this triggers a user local installation of dotnet.\r\n\r\nPR coming on this.\r\n",
