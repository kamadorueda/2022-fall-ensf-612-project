I then ran `Get-ExecutionPolicy -list` and the results are the same. Process level is bypass. After that, I exited the 'pwsh' process, and started a 'powershell' process and ran `Get-ExecutionPolicy -list` just to show the difference, should it be relevant.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45504030/145899544-796eec4b-e5d8-48f1-a92a-dea7fc35fa78.png)\r\n\r\nWhere might I go to figure out what might be doing it?
