What is considered standard when checking for variables that could be null in the powershell community? StrictMode is set to version 3.0 so it seems like checking for this variable in most cases would throw an error (since it is never initialized by Start-DevPowerShell). Should this if statement be removed? Or perhaps should should StrictMode be set to Off before this if statement?",
