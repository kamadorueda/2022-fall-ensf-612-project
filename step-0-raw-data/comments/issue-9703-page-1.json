    "body": "This is (or was)  by design. IIRC we serialize scriptblocks to strings in flight to reduce the risk of accidentally executing code. The problem was that, when trying to secure a remote endpoint, there were so many places that scriptblock parameters could automatically get executed we just blocked everything. Since you can explicitly turn a string into a scriptblock with `[ScriptBlock]::Create()` (but not with a cast!) it was viewed as being not too onerous. Of course this doesn't really make sense for background jobs so maybe we should reconsider our strategy here :-)",
