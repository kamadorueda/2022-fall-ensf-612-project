All I can do here is guess.\r\n\r\nBest guess I have is that you're expecting this to somehow invoke Windows PowerShell. That's not how #Requires works.\r\n\r\nAll #Requires statements do is validate whether the constraint can be met in the currently-running session. They do not do anything other than that. If the constraint isn't met, it is supposed to simply fail.",
