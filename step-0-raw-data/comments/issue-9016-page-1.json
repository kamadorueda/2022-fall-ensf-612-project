Identifying the root cause of issues like this is not trivial, but is not super hard too.\r\nI would like to, **gradually**, update the instances in `CachedReflectionInfo`, which work with public instance or static members of public types, to use the overload of `GetMethod/GetProperty` that require the parameter type argument. It's by no means an urgent work.\r\n\r\nBut I want us to be more future proof on this, meaning that when reviewing code, spot `GetMethod(string)` or similar that are called on public types, and use the more explicit overload instead.",
