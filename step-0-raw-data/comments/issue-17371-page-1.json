I can go back to PS 5.1 and use gwmi.   I am new to PS 7.x so if there is another way to pull the logged in user of a computer easily please let me know.  I have tried numerous ways and everytime I add the -ComputerName option it always returns blank but if I go to a computer and run (get-ciminstance -Class Win32_OperatingSystem).username it will work fine just not remotely.",
