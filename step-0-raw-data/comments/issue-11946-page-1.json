    "body": "> Redirection paths typically won't exist for most use cases\r\n\r\nI agree that in most use cases the redirection files for standard output/error don't exist beforehand. But `-RedirectStandardInput` by definition requires an existing file. \r\nEven for `-RedirectStandardError` and `-RedirectStandardOutput`, it's hard to say the current wildcard behavior is not being used at all. I can imagine a CI system where a new log file is created every day in the format `ci-log-<date>.txt` and output/error of a process is supposed to be written to that log file. For this hypothetical scenario, it's natural to use a wildcard like `ci-log-*.txt` for those 2 parameters (only one file, which is created on that day, will be matched). I think that's why the committee decide to suggest a more conservative (less breaking) behavior.\r\n\r\n> Working Directory by definition cannot be a useful wildcarded path, which can usually be assumed to exist.\r\n\r\nOne can create two directories named `[a]b` and `ab`. `[a]b` is a valid wildcard that matches `ab`.
