    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT Cheers, much appreciated!\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm thinking that it may make the most sense to simply require Suggestions to be supplied inside the ErrorRecord itself when creating the error record (or added post-creation by setting the property, if desired). Adding a whole bunch of logic for a suggestion-per-each-error-type model seems... unnecessarily reliant on the engine, when it could just be a simple \"query the ErrorRecord to see if it's got a suggestion available\" when displaying errors.\r\n\r\nI can see an argument for wanting to keep around a suggestion item here and there in some kind of cache I suppose, but equally modules could simply keep a copy of their base Suggestion object in a module-scoped variable or static property for class-based modules. It could even be a base suggestion that you just copy around and supply new arguments to whenever needed.\r\n\r\nI'm currently looking at how best to decouple the suggestions from conhost completely. Need to examine where CommandNotFoundException (for example) is typically generated and where the ErrorRecord for it is built. Some of the others can be implemented in their respective cmdlets themselves or perhaps in the common parameters implementations (for Transaction-related suggestions I suppose?)\r\n\r\nMultiple suggestions wouldn't be too hard, just a matter of allowing it and working out display kinks.\r\n\r\nHalf-thinking aloud, but yeah should be pretty doable. ðŸ˜„ ",

Would they just show up in _any_ error where the first command is one of the listed command names?\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nNewSuggestion(\r\n    id: 1,\r\n    category: \"Transactions\",\r\n    matchType: SuggestionMatchType.Command,\r\n    rule: \"^Start-Transaction\",\r\n    suggestion: SuggestionStrings.Suggestion_StartTransaction,\r\n    enabled: true),\r\nNewSuggestion(\r\n    id: 2,\r\n    category: \"Transactions\",\r\n    matchType: SuggestionMatchType.Command,\r\n    rule: \"^Use-Transaction\",\r\n    suggestion: SuggestionStrings.Suggestion_UseTransaction,\r\n    enabled: true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: I think the Use-Transaction one can be covered by simply adding it to any errors generated during that command's operation...

It can't be in the cmdlet itself, because the cmdlet itself doesn't perform any actions that throw errors (that I can see).",

In script modules we would need to either utilise Write-Information _or_ we would need to create a new Write-Suggestion cmdlet.\r\n\r\nFor ease of use with compiled cmdlets I could add a `Write()` method to the suggestion class itself which calls WriteInformation() perhaps along with some flag to tell the host to check the preference variable, or similar.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of this approach?",
