Then I had a script to create an array of objects (normal ones, not dynamic) to run through a pipeline, and then had a `for` loop to repeatedly run the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThere was enough variability that I tried to eliminate the effect of GCs (by using `[gc]::TryStartNoGCRegion`), but that only worked for fairly small amounts of work (a handful of seconds), and besides, how much garbage each method produced would actually be an interesting and material effect on perf, so I just printed out the number of GCs along with the times.\r\n\r\nI tested `where`, `select`, and `foreach-object`, with and without wildcards (and for select, with wildcards to match multiple properties), and couldn't see much difference between them. The dynamic stuff seemed like it might be slightly faster (and generated a little less garbage--perhaps that's what made the difference).\r\n\r\nI tried adding artificial magnification--doing either the dynamic access or normal access in a `for` loop--but even that didn't make much of a difference. But in general, the dynamic access seemed ever-so-slightly faster, probably because it usually generated a little less garbage. (And as a result of my GC-consciousness, I also switched the `DynamicPropertyGetter` class to be a struct.)\r\n",
