It make more sense because scripts can works (manage accounts) without the need to install AdminTools everyware. \r\nI did not look at this in detail, but it is quite possible that we could get almost the same functionality using the cmdlet aliases and parameters. I suppose it should stay outside of this module.",

If plan is to replace Windows PowerShell with PowerShell 7.0 we need to get back most of common modules and features that we lost in porting time. \r\n\r\n- Please point me the community that is ready to take on the production of this module for all the necessary platforms. Over the past 3 years, I have repeatedly heard that we need to decouple modules. But where are the people who take it upon themselves? I am ready to make the module (and make other contributions) _in the repo_ but I am not ready to take on the entire production cycle.\r\n\r\n- Currently I have 99.9% needed PowerShell features in-box on all my enterprise servers to manage the infrastructure. Today we (I say about enterprise) cannot replace Windows PowerShell with PowerShell Core because it is slow, consumes a lot of resources and, mostly, lost a lot of functionality. (I do not think that it is possible to fix it a few months before the 7.0 release.) We can not freely use third-party modules because strong enterprise policy - we can not trust whole Internet, validate every new version, we have isolated networks. PowerShell for us is an enterprise level management tool. If it will have not all we had many years we will have to spend time and money to implement/find workarounds (maybe write internal scripts to replace gaps or more likely to replace it with a better alternative management tool).",

I think we only complicate dev process. Before the decouple I could make PR in the PowerShell repo and get test results in minutes. Now I do not even know how long it takes to set up the environment, compile and get test results (only locally!). This is not so important as the module is stable.\r\n\r\nMain benefit from the decoupling I see for projects which is under high community development activity. \r\nHave we such modules in the repo? No, all modules is stable.\r\nI guess we could develop new HelpSystem module in separate repo but first we should decouple current one from engine but after that I don't expect high community activity so the moving in a separate project loses its meaning - if someone wants to make another module based on new public API he can do it in himself repo.\r\n\r\nSecond benefit is the ability to create a PowerShell distributive of the minimum size.\r\n\r\nWe could easily resolve this like .Net Core does. They have a runtime with most of needed code and dozen packages.\r\nThis means that important frequently used modules live in this PowerShell repository, but are also published as packages (or/and directly included in distributive).\r\n",

Eventually, I want to split up and move Utility and Management modules out of this repo (see #9960). Since the code is all self contained in a single folder, I think it's ok to just keep it in this repo for now and we can move it out when we do so for the others. By that time, hopefully we'll have templatized how to create the repos, contributing docs/etc.., enable CI, etc...\r\n\r\nIn all honesty this is something that has needed prioritising for far too long now and with each month that passes with new additions like this suggested new module it makes the task harder and harder and IMO unlikely that it will ever happen. The community have tried to help get steering on this many times before however the issue becomes a case of it being very opinionated on how the best way forward is. I personally want to see this happen for v7 \r\n\r\nMy main concern about bundling more and more into this repo is unnecessary bloat that is not critical to the running and using of the core engine of PowerShell. PowerShellGet/PSReadline are 2 examples where they aren't engine critical so rightly live outside the engine and can be pulled in at packaging time.\r\n\r\nHonestly as part of v7 plans you should minimize the amount of code being added to this repo that is new functionality that is not v7 critical (this change IMO is not critical for PowerShell use in v7) and therefore should be externalised and any new modules to be bundled into this repo should go through RFC Process IMO\r\n\r\nAlso see my comment in #9960 - this to me feels like the wrong place to put effort in. \r\n\r\n\r\n> We could easily resolve this like .Net Core does. They have a runtime with most of needed code and dozen packages.\r\n\r\nThis would be the output of this issue would it not - #5681 - which is where I would like to see v7 lead to. with default install being minimal but additional packages available to bootstrap other uses (which in windows could be additional check boxes in the additional features part of programs and features)",

(Even if you start with one cmdlet, it should make sense in the context of a planned design for the rest of the module.)\r\n\r\nWe also just commented in #9960, and agree that the decision there should not block whether we accept this PR. \r\n\r\n@iSazonov I totally hear your requirements around not being able to pull things in from the web, and to that end I think it's important to separate the two issues around shipping modules in the Gallery and where the source code ultimately lives. Those should be independent, and we should close them in #9960.\r\n\r\nThat being said, we do believe it makes sense for this to start as a Gallery module for validation. This isn't to say it should never be included in any PS7 package of any kind, but it would allow you to iterate much more quickly than if we are constrained by the RFC process. And in fact, you could publish to the Gallery today, we on the team and in the community could play with it, and your implementation can serve as a much easier basis for writing and reviewing an RFC about taking it into PS7. \r\n\r\n(And we discussed that it might be a good idea to actually make that the general guidance for contributing new modules all up.)",

They are not difficult to care for and water, and they bring pleasure. Fewer people are ready to plant flowers in front of the house because it takes more time and effort. And very few people are willing to go a long way to devote their time somewhere to caring for flowers, and even more so to do it in many places just for fun.\r\nI mean - most members of the community are present here for fun and not business. The further you move the code away from the center and the more it is sprayed on the repositories, the more costs you cause and the less pleasure it brings.\r\n\r\nThe best model for community contributions that MSFT invented is the CoreFX / CoreCLR model.
