While I like the idea of sharing my default profiles and possibly scripts across PCs using OneDrive, this should be done using the proper Windows folders, namely AppData Local/Roaming, because this is the convention on Windows and it works well. Also better than dotfiles and dotfolders in the home directory.\r\n\r\nSo the correct path would be something like `$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Powershell\\` or `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Microsoft\\Powershell\\`",

Powershell profiles / scripts / modules are not documents in the traditional meaning.

While the latter is common on *nix operating systems, the appfolders are the way to go on Windows.",

    "body": "@PowerShell/powershell-committee reviewed this, and we believe the risk of changing the \"user PowerShell folder\" across versions/editions of PowerShell and downlevel versions of the OS is too high to take the chance. Symlinks aren't well supported downlevel, and if users want to change their Documents to not use OneDrive, they can do so. Additionally, migration logic on upgrades (and/or moving/linking to existing folders) is extremely hard to get right 100%, and we don't want to leave users in a broken state. Additionally, `$profile` can be used for changing `PSModulePath` or executing profiles in other locations, and users can create their own symlinks for re-routing the folder. \r\n\r\nThat being said, it might be worth creating an automatic variable in PowerShell that points to the \"user PowerShell folder\" across platforms.

    "body": "@KirkMunro technically what you describe is only accurate in 4 particular scenarios and in each of these this is historically kept in line with existing on Windows functionality where User PSModulePath has always been housed in `$env:userprofile\\Documents`\r\n\r\n1. You log in with a Microsoft account to a new Device - this is something you can bypass completely and use a Local Only account mitigating this issue completely\r\n2. You log into a new device that has Organisational policies that enforces the use of Onedrive for Business\r\n3. You sign into OneDrive (consumer) on a device using a non-Microsoft account, ie a local login, and link it with your Microsoft account login\r\n4. You sign into OneDrive for Business on a device using a either an AD or AAD backed account and link it with your organisations Office 365 instance.\r\n\r\nIn Scenario 1/3\r\nCreating a new Local user and using that bypasses this being an issue\r\nAlso telling OneDrive not to sync the PowerShell Folder (which you can do in the UI nice and easily) again bypasses this being a problem from size concerns but adds another one where syncing your profile script and other needed scripts is now a manual task.\r\n\r\nIn Scenario 2/4 \r\nThe User `$PSModulePath` updates to either\r\n\r\n-  `$env:userprofile/Onedrive-<Orgname>/Documents` \r\n-  `$env:userprofile/Onedrive/Documents`\r\n\r\nbecause under the Hood OneDrive Sync Client has performed User Document folder redirection which is actually set as a registry setting which is all that is being read here to create the path used in PowerShell\r\n\r\nIf you never enable Onedrive sync of the docs folder then the folder stays `$env:userprofile/Documents/`\r\n\r\nThe only time I know this to be different is when orgs set Users Home Drives to be a H Drive on a mapped drive location which is often set in AD and enforced via GPO which is also just a reg key setting. But that just updates the `$env:userprofile` variable not the docs folder itself\r\n\r\nSo technically this is NOT a PowerShell issue to contemplate solving and is something that with user training to say `hey you can tell Onedrive not to sync that PowerShell Folder but still sync everything else in the Docs folder` \r\n\r\n> Why use the documents folder in the first place? Powershell profiles / scripts / modules are not documents in the traditional meaning. I suggest use the generic appfolders (local, roaming) provided in Windows by default instead of using Documents or even the proposed $env:USERPROFILE.powershell. While the latter is common on *nix operating systems, the appfolders are the way to go on Windows.\r\n\r\nScripts are still documents, whether they are `traditional documents` or not is neither here nor there, same with any text file and as such should be loosely treated like standard document\r\n\r\nI for one can't stand the messiness caused by all the apps that write configurations to a folder like below because they do not allow me to bring my configurations of those applications across with me as a user of those applications to new machines. where as in the docs folder I can dump 100 scripts that I may need inc my profile script and 20 modules that I need and be 100% sure that I can rebuild that machine or deploy an additional machine and my profile brings these modules and scripts with me ready to use straight away, lowering the mean time to recover if i suffer a bricked update or a hardware failure or even a lost/stolen device.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6355225/59885936-eeb8de00-93b4-11e9-9a88-29ef0d2ddf64.png)\r\n\r\nOverall this is a 10+ year profile placement that at the time made sense for admin scripters and IMO still makes sense in its current implementation - I am aware I am in the minority in this thread but IMO changing this to a `.powershell` folder in `$env:userprofile` or `$env:LocalAPPDATA` `$env:APPDATA` to me feels like a mix of breaking existing well understood functionality and wasted engineering effort for what I see to be no actual useful gain.\r\n\r\nand to @joeyaiello point I can't see a need for adding engineering effort behind an automatic var that perhaps is going to be used by a very small subset of users compared to the mass majority",
