I'm thinking mostly in terms of the variable syntax itself:\r\n\r\n```\r\n${C:\\Program Files}\r\n```\r\nShould, to me at least, call Get-ChildItem instead of Get-Content, because the targeted item is a container. Or, alternatively, there should be a similar syntax that *can* target Get-ChildItem as opposed to Get-Content.\r\n\r\nI think an error is still sensible for an undefinable use like this:\r\n```\r\n${C:\\Program Files} = \"foo\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRather than simply having Get-Content automatically call Get-ChildItem when targeting a container, I think it would simply be more sensible for the variable syntax to not be constrained to a single method, and be capable of calling Get-ChildItem when pointed at a container object. (And since there is no Set-ChildItem, nor would having one be very sensible in my opinion, attempting to *set* a container value like this should error.)\r\n\r\nI agree that changing the behaviour of the cmdlets themselves in such a fashion is verging on insanity.",
