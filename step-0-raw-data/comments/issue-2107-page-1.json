The desired functionality is already provided by several Windows Powershell IDEs such as PowerGUI and PowerShell Studio. If anything a community module could provide the same functionality. There is also the security concern with executables. Personally I prefer to review any script that I might run before hand which an executable cannot provide.\n",

In addition I feel that other people should be able to see the code, as it provides an excellent way for others to learn. Last but not least, believe me, I've been there back in the 90s when we used the WinBatch compiler all over the place, so much compiled executables, bad managed source code repositories, and there you go, the guy that wrote the executable no longer works for the company and you won't have access to the source anymore. \n\nJust my 2 cents. \nAlex\n",
