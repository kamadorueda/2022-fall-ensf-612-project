Windows Store has evolved but I'm not sure you can do everything you want. Also remember how store apps update in background. If you are an admin, you dont want. It's for casual usage ! \r\n\r\nThe scenario, I have in mind is to use the automatic updated couple of VSCode/PowerShell/PowerShell-VSCode to develop and keep the MSI version to be my default shell\r\n\r\nOpen a new issue, if you have a scenario that doesn't fit.\r\n\r\nThis one should be closed as the URL is now online.",
