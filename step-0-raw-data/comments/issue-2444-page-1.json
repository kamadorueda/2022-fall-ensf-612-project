    "body": "It is still a problem with SSH since it is a feature of PSRP (PowerShell Remoting Protocol).  Some users would like to better monitor/manage activate remote endpoints on their systems.  They would like to be able to terminate sessions on the target system for some users.  I believe the scenarios are related to PSWS (PowerShell Web Services) where active sessions become abandoned and use system resources.  But I haven't really thought through the issues (privacy?, how such a feature might be abused?) or how PSRP could be modified to support this.  This should be discussed in an RFC.",
