It works fine on `Win10`, `Win2012R2 (after installing prerequisites)` as well as `Win7 x64 (after installing WMF 5.1)`. \r\n\r\n~However, @mirichmo found that with Beta.7 packages, remoting **does not** work on `win7 x86 + WMF 5.1` and `win8.1 x86`. Mike believes the x86 build of `pwrshplugin.dll` is broken. I opened #4955 to track that issue.~\r\n\r\n**_[Update 2]_** It turned out to be a packaging issue. In `psrp.windows-beta.2` package, the `win-x86` folder in the package actually contains the x64 plugin, which caused WinRM to fail to load the plugin on x86 systems.\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed in `psrp.windows-beta.3` package. @mirichmo has verified that remoting works on `Win7-x86 + WMF 5.1` and `WinBlue-x86 (no WMF)` with changes in this PR and the x86 plugin from `psrp.windows-beta.3` package. @mirichmo thanks for the investigation! #4955 is closed.\r\n\r\nQuoted from Mike:\r\n> On Win 7, Enable-PSRemoting throws a non-terminating error, but both it and the install script both successfully register the plugin. \r\nThe non-terminating error is from Get-CimInstance and that is a known issue with MI .Net on Win 7\r\n\r\nI also synced with @nitinbps. He still hasn't got the chance to validate this change. But he is OK that we merge this without his validation. We will handle the issue when/if it comes up.\r\n\r\n@adityapatwardhan so I think we can merge this PR now.",
