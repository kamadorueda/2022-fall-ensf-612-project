Therefore, if my code were to access Azure Key Vault (for example), obtain the URI, assign it to an environment variable, run Invoke-RestMethod using the environment variable, as the Uri parameter value, then it's going to be exposed by Write-Verbose, as I can't remove the environment variable from memory/the session until the command has completed. Therefore, it can easily be written to the PowerShell hosting program.\r\n\r\nI do understand that the environment variable would briefly exist where the user can obtain it, if they knew what they were doing. Still, it would prove helpful in this instance to be able to control what is/isn't written by Invoke-RestMethod. _Perhaps_ I should just control whether Invoke-RestMethod can write verbose commands or not (Verbose:$false). Either way, I wanted to put this out there for discussion; thank you for your time and consideration.",

If you're dealing with such URIs you put -Verbose:$false whenever they are called and the issue goes away.  \r\n \r\nInstead this makes life harder for anyone who builds REST URIs. And since I do a lot of that, this change would waste hours of time. It took 5 minutes to work round by using a proxy function,  (see https://gist.github.com/jhoneill/f8ddd4e4e0a25c22d77749166d6f14fe ) , so as \"security\", frankly it's not doing much. \r\nAnd anyone who goes down the proxy route can headers with authorization info to verbose. \r\n\r\nThe issue has never been closed, can we please judge this change to be a mistake and revert to the previous behaviour ?\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/gists/gist-og-image.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> Gist</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jhoneill/f8ddd4e4e0a25c22d77749166d6f14fe\">Invoke-RestMethod.ps1</a></strong></div><div>GitHub Gist: instantly share code, notes, and snippets.</div></blockquote>",

Telling me I called the right server is zero help.  \r\n\r\nTo me this has solved a non-problem by breaking functionality which people needed.  IWR and IRM don't use debug, but that's another story. I have the proxy function as a solution but I'm currently faced with going to every place where I have ever used either of these and putting `If version >= 7.2 Write-Verbose / write-debug  $uri ` \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
