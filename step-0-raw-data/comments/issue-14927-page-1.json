If a script shows its progress using `Write-Progress` and uses `Compress-Archive`, the indicator set by the former is overwritten by the one set by the latter, so the indicator that's visible most of the time is 0% since that's what it's reset to at the end of the `Compress-Archive`\r\n\r\nThis can be experimented with something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam([int] $Count = 10, [int] $Delay = 10, [switch] $Archive)\r\n\r\nfor ($i=0; $i -lt $Count; $i++)\r\n{\r\n    Write-Host (\"{0}/{1}\" -f $i, $Count)\r\n    Write-Progress -Activity 'Activity' -Status 'Status' -PercentComplete (100 * ($i+1) / $Count)\r\n    if ($Archive)\r\n    {\r\n        Remove-Item c:/tmp/foo.zip -ea 0\r\n        Compress-Archive -destination c:/tmp/foo.zip C:\\Users\\steph\\OneDrive\\Images\\*.cr2\r\n    }\r\n    Start-Sleep -Seconds $Delay\r\n}\r\nWrite-Progress -Activity 'Activity' -Status 'Status' -Completed\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think what we need is some global stack-based encapsulation of the indicator, where the latest desired indicator is \"pushed\" to the top of the stack, and the indicator is restored to the previous state on a \"pop\" operation.",
