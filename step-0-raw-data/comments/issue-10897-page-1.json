So what you think doesn't work is parsed like this:\r\n```\r\n$MyVar?? = \"if null set to this\"\r\n```\r\nSo, according to PowerShell, this works as expected.  \r\n\r\nThere's been a discussion about disallowing `?` in variable names in PS7 for this reason but the worry is breaking existing scripts that use `?` in variable names.\r\n\r\nAt the very least there should be a new PSScriptAnalyzer rule that warns on script like `$MyVar??=\"if null set to this\"` to tell you that might not be doing what you expect.",
