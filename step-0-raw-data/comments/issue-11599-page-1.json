So either that just doesn't happen on non-Windows (or maybe on core at all) or something is blocking the queue.\r\n\r\nEither way, even if it does typically work, unless they removed the timeout for processing finalizers; this needs to hook into some process exiting event.\r\n\r\n@nAnderYang Does it create (and not remove) a file every time the schedule task runs?  And can you provide an example directory listing with file names and sizes?  Can you see if it reproduces when running an empty script?\r\n\r\n@iSazonov I don't have easy access to a unix machine to test this with, if you do can you verify that this repros by just starting and exiting?\r\n",

    "body": "Windows cleans up all resources when a process exits, including named pipes, but it looks like we can't rely on this for Linux systems.  For Windows PowerShell we were using the CLR Appdomain unload event to dispose of the server pipe, but that is not implemented in dotNet core. We can use the ProcessExit event to do this for dotNet.  That is not always reliable but i think it is our best bet.\r\n\r\nAnother idea is to make this named pipe listener opt-in.  But this diminishes its usefulness somewhat for debugging.",

I wonder who really uses them. How many developers actually ever needed them? I always think \"Telemetry\" or \"Diagnostic\" is something you enable when you think something is wrong.\r\n\r\nI understand that some reason you would like to keep telemetry ENABLED for everybody. But then you should be able to fix these issues earlier than 2 years. I disabled them with opt-out, but it's still causing lots of directories. I see that many people have the similar issue, so it means that something is wrong here.\r\n\r\nMaybe nobody uses PowerShell + .NET on Linux production machines and nobody cares. But we do. We trusted Microsoft, we migrated to Linux due to Linux support and we have these issues for a long time already.\r\n\r\nThis might be not related with PowerShell, maybe a pure .NET issue. But we use PowerShell. So if there is a bug with .NET, I assume PowerShell team should open the issue.\r\n\r\nI will give it a try with PowerShell 7.3.0-preview.5. I hope newest beta version works.

It was eventually making production server unstable and crashing the apps. Then customer calls us and says our agent crashes their production servers. Even one time, due to thousand of these files on hundreds of servers, we were accused to make huge IO and bring their virtualmachine storage down.\r\n\r\nI strongly belive that these files should be created on request. We never need these files but they are keep generated and causes lots of troubles on the large customers.

The feature is for advanced debugging and is rare enough that if it is needed, it is Ok to require a user to set up a special session that has named pipe connections turned on (opt-in) in order to debug an issue.\r\n\r\nBut before this feature is made `opt-in`, we feel some time should be spent looking into whether PowerShell could perform clean-up of the orphaned named pipe files on non-Windows machines (this issue is only for non-Windows as Windows OS doesn't use files for named pipes and cleans up process resources on exit).

The CLR creates three files in the users `/tmp` directory along with the PowerShell listener named pipe file, which are also leaked after abrupt termination.  So disabling the PowerShell listener will not completely solve the problem.\r\n\r\nBut I believe the dotNET CLR allows you to disable its named pipe files via an environment variable.  We can do something similar with PowerShell to allow users to opt-out of creating the listener (and named pipe file) on PowerShell start up.  This can be done via command parameter and with policy/configuration setting.",
