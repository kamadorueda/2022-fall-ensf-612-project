    "body": "What I think you may be misunderstanding here is that switch parameters don't take values like other parameters do. A function call like `Get-Thing -Switch $true` doesn't pass `$true` to the switch parameter -- ever. Providing the name of the switch parameter **is** providing a value, intrinsically, it doesn't expect another value to be bound to it.  So this command call:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nGet-param -ThirdParam 'Param3' -SecondParam $true\r\n```\r\n\r\nPasses the expected value to $ThirdParam, passes an implicit $true to $SecondParam because it's a switch parameter, and then PS attempts to find a parameter that can take the positional value $true, and picks the first parameter.\r\n\r\nIf you want to pass a value explicitly to a switch parameter, you need to use different syntax:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nGet-param -ThirdParam 'Param3' -SecondParam:$true\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `:` forces PS to bind the value to the named parameter, even if it is a switch parameter.",
