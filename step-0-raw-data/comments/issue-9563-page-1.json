Part of the problem is for CI/CD to be aware of GitHub issues, we'd have to have a wrapper to skip the tests by querying GitHub at runtime.  Although doable, this will hit GitHub API throttling issues unless we use someone's personal access token.\r\n\r\nI do like the idea of submitting bug reports as Pester tests and a few people actually do this, but I suspect the number of people able to author Pester tests (let along good Pester tests) is extremely small compared to the total number of folks reporting issues.  I think if regular contributors start doing this leading by example, we may see more of it happening.",
