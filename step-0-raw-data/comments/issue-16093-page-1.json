    "body": "> My issue is this: conhost should allow more fonts than just bitmap fonts, because it's no longer 1998. :)\r\n\r\nThat's the crux of the issue, it's a conhost problem, that may or may not have a future at all. Pwsh just uses conhost because that's the behaviour in Windows when a console process is spawned without a console supplied. Starting `powershell.exe`, `cmd.exe`, or any other console compiled application will behave in the exact same way and thus this problem isn't something specific to `pwsh.exe`.\r\n\r\nIn saying all this, the link to the [PowerLine](https://github.com/Jaykul/PowerLine) module would potentially indicate it's possible to install the PowerLine font on conhost for use in PowerShell. Specifically see https://github.com/Jaykul/PowerLine#powerline-fonts-and-separators. I'm personally unsure how this is actually possible but potentially the fonts in question fit inside the BMP allowing it to be used in conhost.\r\n\r\nEdit: Reading online seems to indicate the PowerLine font glyphs cover codepoints inside BMP 0 (0x0000 - 0xFFFF) so just installing the font and selecting it should be enough. You can configure conhost for `pwsh.exe` to use a specific font or even have a shortcut to `pwsh.exe` with it's own specific font setting as well.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/f6b21099385cf33786354a1c2d786d40515bdb474f4b01aeaa2d1fc4243aaa22/Jaykul/PowerLine\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Jaykul/PowerLine\">GitHub - Jaykul/PowerLine: A more PowerShell prompt</a></strong></div><div>A more PowerShell prompt.

I'm not saying that's the issue of PowerShell, but that doesn't mean it's not an issue.  Relying on additional software, be it Fluent Terminal, Windows Terminal, or otherwise, on top of the default install in order to support proper fonts seems a bit of a hack to me.",
