    "body": "This is intentional behaviour, as @markekraus describes in his [blog post](https://get-powershellblog.blogspot.com/2018/06/why-invoke-restmethod-and-convertfrom.html) on the subject. Essentially, it's to preserve the nature of the response object in as close-to-the-actual-object form as possible, because in JSON requests whether or not the object is wrapped in an outer array _is_ often important (unlike PowerShell).\r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the blog post, you can simply pipe through a `ForEach-Object {$_}` statement to force the collection to be unrolled every time.\r\n\r\nThis _is_ slated to be changed, per the committee's decision in #3424, but it's pending a full RFC write up and process before we can do any code changes. And, at present, it doesn't seem like anyone has full agreement on exactly how this should be handled through downstream cmdlets.",
