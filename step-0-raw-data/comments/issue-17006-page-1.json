In the short term, this would allow users to set their own default views to a builtin Narrow view that suits their console, if they prefer / require a narrower-width console.\r\n2. In the longer term, look to enhance the formatting system to be able to recognise that it is operating in a narrow console, and automatically switch to the appropriate \"Narrow\" view to better fit in the console by default.\r\n\r\nSome other relevant discussion points:\r\n\r\n- `-AutoSize` by default is probably not a great option, especially for this cmdlet, as it creates inconsistent output for example in the case of using `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`, many tables with varying column widths can be generated if `-AutoSize` is the default, which may not be desirable. Similar issues exist for any other cmdlet which includes grouping behaviour in its default formatter.\r\n- As a part of the longer-term effort, it may be worth looking into whether the formatter can more intelligently select columns to drop in a case where it is forced to fit into a very narrow console.",
