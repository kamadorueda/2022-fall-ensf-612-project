    "body": "I like the overall sentiment here and was going to request something similar, though I would prefer to see this information (perhaps in addition to what was suggested) in the history. I already have a `$prompt` function that makes use of history (along with some types-added script properties) but can't really approximate the behavior suggested in this feature request for the reasons given. How `$LASTEXITCODE` is handled - specifically that it's not reset - and because `$?` is always `$true`  in the `$prompt` function (perhaps this is set after `$prompt` is invoked?) means I need this support in PowerShell itself.",
