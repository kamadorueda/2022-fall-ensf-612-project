Then 3rd party modules need to adapt to it as well in order for this version to be useful, which will take at least another 6 months to get a reasonable coverage (and bear in mind that some modules never will)... Then account for delay and unexpected problems, etc... So, no, I think it is only wishful thinking that one can get rid of all technical debt in one version in one go (and still develop and not just maintain the old version).\r\n\r\nAs much as I wished that such a version existed, I think it will only be possible to get to it slowly one breaking change at a time. With v6 a lot of breaking changes were already accepted but I think if one includes too many breaking changes in one version, it will become too complex to upgrade existing scripts/modules. It's good to discuss the most valuable breaking changes but until there isn't an LTS version of pwsh, I do not think it is time to think about having a 2nd train of pwsh with more substantial changes in parallel to the existing mainstream version.",

    "body": "Javascript is a special case. You're pretty much stuck with it so transpiling is really the only option. Typescript is \"just\" Javascript with extensions so it's easy for people to adopt. Any javascript program is a typescript program so you start with what you have and  just add annotations from there. Dart, on the other hand, is it's own language but transpiles to either javascript or a native runtime in Chrome (at least that was the plan at one point). Dart doesn't seem to have picked up much adoption outside of Google, likely because it is its own language..\r\n\r\n@BurtHarris \r\n> Python 3 is certainly the horror show, has it really caught on yet?\r\n\r\nI was reading an article last week where the author was claiming critical mass had been achieved for Python 3.  That all the core modules were available and now people where migrating in droves. We shall see..\r\n\r\n>Interesting. I've always wondered why the 1 in .ps1 would be used to add a sort of semantic versioning to PowerShell scripts, allowing a script to indicate if it was adapted to possible breaking changes..\r\n\r\nWRT `.ps1`, we reserved the right to change the extension in case we got the language completely wrong resulting in  catastrophic changes to the runtime  such that scripts for the previous version just wouldn't work. But changing the extension also leads to a huge pile of work because so many things in the ecosystem are tied to an extension.  So it's not something to do lightly. And of course, being part of Windows, if we forked the extension, we'd still have to maintain both versions (kind of like Python 2/3).",

    "body": "I think the scale of the negative consequences of such breaking changes has already been covered, and I agree with most of those points.  I am writing this because I am doubtful that, in the greater context, these changes would yield significant benefits in the first place.  At least for the way I use PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThe OP includes the following statement:\r\n\r\n>On the flip side, the inevitable by-product was the accumulation of technical debt that requires memorizing exceptions and is a barrier to newcomers.\r\n\r\nThe implied premise of this statement seems to be that making these various breaking changes would alleviate the burden of memorizing exceptions.  Indeed that would be a great outcome.  However, I am skeptical that that would be the result.  PowerShell's behavior is deliberately rich.  This makes it both expressive and unpredictable.  Expressiveness and predictability seem to work against one another, at least amongst the languages I am familiar with.  \r\n\r\nWhile I agree that many of the breaking changes mentioned above would improve predictability somewhat in some cases, many unpredictable and surprising aspects of the language will remain.  Despite spending years writing PowerShell, I am still frequently surprised by PowerShell behavior that seems to be by design and probably shouldn't be changed.  Some recent examples that come to mind are as follows:\r\n\r\n* conditional delayed binding of `[scriptblock]` arguments (#6419)\r\n* when, exactly, implicit enumeration occurs (#5832)\r\n* conversion of `[AutomationNull]::Value` to `$null` during parameter binding (#6357 is related)\r\n* the impact of `break` and `continue` on flow of control in the pipeline (#5811)\r\n* what happens when you splat `$null` ([SO](https://stackoverflow.com/q/29088004/1404637))\r\n* how using scriptblocks across session states affects `$_` ([SO 1](https://stackoverflow.com/q/28665898/1404637), [SO 2](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48697830/1404637))\r\n\r\nI expect that these examples are just a small fraction of the many other carefully-designed but surprising nuances I have not yet discovered.  I selected these examples because\r\n\r\n1. they represent behavior that probably can't be improved upon in PowerShell, and\r\n2. I have no hope of reliably spotting all of their implications when reading or writing PowerShell.  \r\n\r\nI'm fine with this.  The overwhelming majority of surprising PowerShell behavior does not have lasting impact on my success with PowerShell.  Surprising behavior is almost always caught immediately by testing during development.  I learn from the things that slip through and use that to improve my testing strategy.  This is true whether those surprising behaviors are the kind that could be eliminated or the kind that must remain.\r\n\r\nWhether the proposed breaking changes above are made to or not, PowerShell will never become so predictable that I can significantly reduce test coverage.  In other words, the way I use PowerShell, I don't think there's much of an upside that's even possible by making the breaking changes proposed above.\r\n\r\n(BTW, thank you @mklement0 for directly asking this question.  This has been in the back of my mind for a while.  It's good to see the opportunity for everyone to say their piece.)",

    "body": "Thanks, @alx9r.\r\n\r\nI think it's important to distinguish between _intrinsic_ complexity and _extrinsic_ complexity:\r\n\r\n* _Intrinsic_ complexity stems from the inherent complexity of the concepts being implemented, which in the case of PowerShell has two primary sources: _internal_ complexity from introducing a new paradigm (object-based pipeline) and marrying two distinct worlds (shell syntax and programming-language syntax), and _external_ complexity from interfacing with multiple, disparate outside worlds.\r\n\r\n   * Intrinsic complexity is managed by documenting concepts and features properly and also given them _names_. \r\n\r\n  * #6419 is a prime example: a powerful and widely useful feature underlies it, but it is ~presently not documented at all, as far as I know, and it has no established name~; see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2338 [since documented as _delay-bind_ script blocks]\r\n\r\n  * The _member enumeration_ feature similarly lacks an established name and focused documentation - see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2198\r\n\r\n      * An _extrinsic_ aspect of member enumeration is discussed in #6802.\r\n\r\n  * #5832 is another candidate for proper conceptual documentation.\r\n\r\n      * However, you've discovered two _extrinsic_ aspects of the current behavior: [giving all scalars not just a `.Count`, but also a `.Length` property](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5832#issuecomment-356811405) and [parameter-binding enumeration behavior being subtly different from pipeline/operator behavior](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5832#issuecomment-356475451). \r\n\r\n* _Extrinsic_ complexity stems from leaky abstractions and inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n   * Such complexity should be _eliminated_ .\r\n    * If that is not an option due to backward-compatibility concerns, such complexity should be _documented as known problems_. \r\n    \r\n    * The script-module variable scoping behavior (which you reference in the context of `$_`) is more than just a quirk: it is the root cause of a major problem, the previously mentioned #4568.\r\n\r\n    * All other issues you mention strike me as falling into the extrinsic category (rather than being the result of careful design), because they all present as inconsistencies that have no obvious (documented) rationale or benefit:\r\n      * It makes more sense for splatting with `$null` to pass _no_ arguments rather than a positional `$null` argument.\r\n      * Why would `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` be converted to `$null` during _parameter binding_, even though the type is preserved in _direct variable assignment_? See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9150#issuecomment-473743805\r\n      *  What benefit is there to the _dynamic_ scoping of `break` and `continue`, across the call stack, with _quiet termination_ if no enclosing loop is found?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhile the wealth of features and the joining of disparate worlds alone makes it hard to remember all requisite _intrinsic_ complexity, minimizing the _extrinsic_ one is still important.\r\n\r\nHaving to test your intended approach first without just knowing and trusting that it will work - or to have things break unexpectedly due to surprising behavior - is a serious productivity (and enjoyment) hindrance (even though PowerShell commendably makes it very easy to interactively test behavior).\r\n\r\nIt comes down to solid concepts (that don't contravene intuitive expectations), descriptive naming, and good documentation:\r\n\r\nIf I don't know it / not sure if I remember correctly, I need to know where to look it up, and have faith that _known problems and edge cases_  are also documented (either as part of the regular help topics or via links from there).\r\n\r\nSo even if we decide that _eliminating_ extrinsic complexity is not an option, we can at least _document it systematically_ - and the discussion here can serve as the starting point for compiling a \"pitfall gallery\" (which may also include cases of unavoidable _intrinsic_ complexity that may be surprising).\r\n",

    "body": ">This might all just be a pipe dream as I haven't seen any real world case where such a model worked...\r\n\r\nIn fact, we already have a model that works all over the world - LTS. MSFT uses this to develop Windows 10. The model is used to develop Unix distributions.\r\nFor us, this means that we could release LTS PowerShell Core versions every two years and include them in Windows 10 LTS versions and Unix LTS version. (One problem is to sync Windows and Unix release dates for LTS versions. I guess MSFT can negotiate with the main Unix companies.)\r\nDuring these two years, we are collecting minor breaking changes, transferring more significant breaking changes to the next cycle.\r\nFor each new LTS version, the ScriptAnalyzer should get a set of new rules to facilitate script migration.\r\nWith this model, critical products and scripts will only have to jump from the previous version to the next after thorough testing and migration.\r\n\r\nI used this approach when I migrated step by step (version by version) an old system from PHP 4 version to next PHP version until I reached the supported PHP 5.x version.  At each step, I had to make relatively small and quick changes, after which the system continued to work for some time until the next step.\r\n\r\nUpdate: It should be in sync with .Net Core LTS versions. I expect that .Net Core 3.1 will be next LTS and PowerShell Core 6.x should have been on the version.",

    "body": "Regarding having multiple versions of powershell which have different feature sets and breaking changes:  We already have this with legacy and core.  Which seems bad at first glance but may provide a working model for the future.  Stay with me...\r\n\r\nWe have to set almost all processes which use powershell to call the core pwsh.exe before running the actual scripts because Windows scheduled tasks, jenkins, and many environments are not powershell core aware.  We do this because we are using features which are only available in a particular PS version.\r\n\r\nIn cases where we cannot force a call to core we have to have every script check which version of PS it is running under and then call itself using the appropriate PS version on the host system.   Whatever trick we use to get the right code to run in the right environment we often are passing all of the environment and parameters to the same script that was already running.\r\n\r\nThat is the UNIX philosophy.  Make a tool do one thing and do it well.  Then combine tools to create a whole that is greater than the sum of its parts.  This is the world of scripting where we make subshell calls to other utilities all the time and process results.  Historically that is scripting.   Powershell trends toward a strange convention by trying to keep all the code native but that is only a convention--not a requirement.  PS runs with access to the OS and all the utilities available just like unix shell scripts.\r\n\r\nThis would be much easier if the file extension for core had been updated to .ps6 so the powershell engine could be doing the work for us.   Each binary version of powershell can remain independent of the others as long as every call to one passes environments and returns the outputs, errors, warnings, exceptions, to the other--which we have to do manually right now at great effort.  It is not necessary to have backward compatible flags in the engine as long as the engine knows which version to run.  The context switching involved is already happening so we are already at worst case scenario.\r\n\r\nWe will be forced to use awful hacks in powershell forever UNLESS we go ahead and break things in a well defined manner.  Breaking changes are not going to make our lives any more difficult than they already are.  Alternatively, if we use incremental, continuous improvement and have the engine do the heavy lifting of switching context then our code (and lives) will be better.",

But I haven't heard much about Perl 6 recently either...\r\n> \r\n> I think the lessons to learn from Python there are to separate breaking changes to the language from a version change to the engine. Hypothetically, a PS 7 engine could still run earlier scripts (.PS1) files in a no-breaking changes mode, while if the script were marked as 7 aware (say with a .PS7 extension) they could declare they have been updated _and_ that the require at-least PS 7 to run. Hope that makes sense.\r\n\r\nI think calling Python 3 a horror show is overly dramatic.  If I look at [PyPi top downloaded packages](https://pypistats.org/top), and grab the individual package metadata about v2 vs v3 downloads, I see v3 has now broken 33% penetration for pretty much all the top packages, and for newer libraries like Ken Reitz' requests library, it's nearly 50/50 split: yesterday there was 685k downloads of v3, vs 875k of v2.\r\n\r\nThe major thing holding Python 3 back for a long time was scientific community support for pandas and pysci.  But, in the latest stats, the scientific community now prefers Python 3 to Python 2: https://pypistats.org/packages/pandas 231k v3 downloads, vs 175k v2 downloads.  \r\n\r\nAs the famous Dr. W. Edwards Deming would say, \"In God we trust; all others, bring data!\"  Maybe you can write a PowerShell script to analzye the PyPi data set and tell me how horrific Python 3 is using data: https://packaging.python.org/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/",

    "body": "I would be happy with (in this exact order):\r\n\r\n1. Easier to use module system that produces good stack traces.\r\n    - For example, psm1 file allows to describe arbitrary rules for how functions are loaded, but this causes cryptic stack traces where all functions are globbed into the psm1 file logically. This means line numbers on stack traces are about as useful as a chocolate teapot. \r\n\r\n2. Replace PowerShell default Error object string formatting that swallows 99% of the usefulness of programming in a stack-based von Neumann architecture.\r\n    - C# more or less gets this right. PowerShell is too clever by half.\r\n\r\n3. Fix null redirection so that the three different ways to redirect output streams to the null device are equivalent in performance.\r\n\r\n4. Fix [dynamic scoping](https://gist.github.com/Cauterite/2355ae9c2142180525275c6ef2b32ad7):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction a($f) {& $f}\r\nfunction main() {\r\n\t$f = {write-host 'success'}\r\n\ta {& $f} # stack-overflow\r\n\ta {& $f}.getnewclosure() # okay\r\n}\r\n[void] (main)\r\n```\r\n\r\n5. Fix [variable capture](https://gist.github.com/Cauterite/4a5e9828d8bd2bd2ed694851576bb137):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nset-strictmode -version 'latest'\r\n$erroractionpreference = 'stop'\r\n\r\nfunction main() {\r\n\t$a = 'foo'\r\n\t$f = {\r\n\t\t$g = {$a}.getnewclosure()\r\n\t\t& $g # \"variable '$a' cannot be retrieved because it has not been set.\"\r\n\t}.getnewclosure()\r\n\t& $f\r\n}\r\n\r\nmain\r\n```\r\n\r\n6. Output accumulates; `return` does not do the same thing as other languages; fix it.\r\n\r\n7. PowerShell Does not have syntactic sugar for Disposing of Objects' External Resources\r\n\r\n8. Rewrite PowerShellGet. It's AWFUL. Functions with hundreds of lines of code, swallowed exceptions, no test coverage.\r\n\r\n9. Get rid of how module caching works.\r\n    - The cache is not thread-safe.  WTF?\r\n    - The whole concept of caching a module for analysis purposes is a kludge/hack.  I realize within Microsoft there is huge support for this feature because PowerShell is so freaking slow, but see my next suggestion for a true fix.\r\n    - The ONLY way to [clear your AnalysisCache](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6818#issuecomment-443877176) is to restart PowerShell.exe\r\n    - Caching of modules for analysis purposes tightly couples analysis to the run-time state of modules.\r\n\r\n10. Provide \"compiled modules\" similar to how Py files compile to pyc files for performance improvement. \r\n\r\n11. Add `$none` literal\r\n    - Consider replacing `$null` with `$none` in many places\r\n    - Reconsider how ParameterSetName works, and allow passing `$none` special value to parameters, so that I do not need to write crazy switch statements to call code 5 different ways.  COM and C# dynamic does this correctly - PowerShell makes this a disaster.  Example would be how I have to dynamically map a deployment configuration for SSRS reports in the ReportingServicesTools module based on Subscription Occurrence type.  I would prefer just to pass a bag of properties and have the method internally deal with the complexity, rather than force externally complexity on end-users.  ParameterSetName is only useful as a concept as a template, not good for programming against.  It muddles ad-hoc polymorphism with intellisense.",

    "body": "> `return` does behave as you expect it to within a `class` method. The way \"output accumulates\" in a regular/advanced PS function is pretty typical for **shell** scripting environments e.g Korn shell and Bash.\r\n\r\nI hear people say this, including @BrucePay (see **emphasis mine**, below, quoting him) , but the bottom line is:\r\n\r\n* In Korn Shell, [return exits a function](https://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man1/return.1.asp), period.\r\n* In Bash, [return exits a function](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4419956/1040437), period.\r\n\r\nOnly in PowerShell do we have this illogical \"return does not return\" non-sense and output accumulates.  This is a glorified memory leak, and you should think of it as such.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, everywhere in PowerShell In Action I search for the phrase \"problems\", I can add something to the vZeroTechnicalDebt list.  Here is what Bruce writes about return statement:\r\n\r\n> 7.3 RETURNING VALUES FROM FUNCTIONS\r\n> Now itâ€™s time to talk about returning values from functions. Weâ€™ve been doing this all along, but thereâ€™s something we need to highlight. **Because PowerShell is a shell, it doesnâ€™t return resultsâ€”it writes output or emits objects.** As youâ€™ve seen, the result of any expression or pipeline is to emit the result object to the caller. At the command line, if you type three expressions separated by semicolons, the results of all three statements are output:\r\n> [...] \r\n> In the traditional approach, you have to initialize a result variable, `$result`, to hold the array being produced, add each element to the array, and then emit the array:\r\n> ```powershell\r\n> PS (16) > function tradnum\r\n>> {\r\n>> $result = @()\r\n>> $i=1\r\n>> while ($i -le 10)\r\n>> {\r\n>> $result += $i\r\n>> $i++\r\n>> }\r\n>> $result\r\n>> }\r\n>```\r\n> This code is significantly more complex: you have to manage two variables in the function now instead of one. If you were writing in a language that didnâ€™t automatically extend the size of the array, it would be even more complicated, as youâ€™d have to add code to resize the array manually. And even though PowerShell will automatically resize the array, itâ€™s not efficient compared to capturing the streamed output. The point is to make you think about how you can use the facilities that PowerShell offers to improve\r\nyour code. If you find yourself writing code that explicitly constructs arrays, consider looking at it to see if it can be rewritten to take advantage of streaming instead.\r\n\r\nI think the motivation behind this feature is nice, but there are much cleaner, easier-to-read ways to achieve the same goal: Implicit promotion from a single object to a collection of objects.  Moreover, PowerShell already has a simple way to return output for redirection: `Write-Output`.",

When someone does do `return 42` it has no bearing on `$?`. It is just another item output (yielded) to the output stream.  \r\n\r\nLike I mentioned before, `$?` is managed by PowerShell and has nothing to do with what a function outputs/returns.  `$?` is set based on generated errors (or the lack thereof).   This means that when you execute `$res = foo` - $res will contain every object output by the function foo.  If you want to know if the function \"failed\" you can inspect `$?` on every single command you execute OR you can wrap a bunch of commands in a `try/catch` block.

    "body": ">  hear people say this, including @BrucePay (see emphasis mine, below, quoting him) , but the bottom line is:\r\n>    In Korn Shell, return exits a function, period.\r\n>   In Bash, return exits a function, period.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell, return exits a function, too:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> function test { \"hello\"; return \"!\"; \"world\"}\r\nPS C:\\> test\r\nhello\r\n!\r\n```\r\n\r\n> Mixing return values and output streams is a bad idea. It can also lead to memory leak-like performance woes\r\n\r\nThere is no mixing because there is no difference between the output stream and the return value in PowerShell. You're talking as if the function writes the strings to stdout and separately returns an exclamation mark to the caller, but it doesn't. Pointing to `write-output` seems like the same mistake; all of these: `write-output 'x'`, `'x'`, `return 'x'` send something down the same output path, to the pipeline. There is no separate return value. \r\n\r\n>  What you really want is co-routines or \"yield return\", or generators, generator-builders and scanners (as in Icon). T\r\n\r\nThat would mean that if you wrote a command on the command line, then put it in a script or function, it would behave differently:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> robocopy /whatever\r\nPS C:\\> \"robocopy /whatever\" | set-content test.ps1; .\\test.ps1\r\nPS C:\\> function test { robocopy /whatever }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI like seeing the same output in all three cases, not have the output swallowed in two cases because I didn't `yield return` for no reason. The way PowerShell does it is consistent and convenient for a shell and writing shell / batch scripts - taking something you wrote on the command line and putting it somewhere you can call it over and over. Doing that shouldn't completely change how the code behaves.\r\n\r\n> The reason being is that input consumption is lazy and failure suspends computation while allowing the portion of computation generated so far to be disposed of.\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell pipeline is controlled by the runtime, if I understand what you're saying, it's already able to to do that: \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS D:\\> 1..1mb |foreach { write-verbose -Verbose \"incoming number: $_\"; $_ } |select -first 3\r\nVERBOSE: incoming number: 1\r\n1\r\nVERBOSE: incoming number: 2\r\n2\r\nVERBOSE: incoming number: 3\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe `select` will terminate the pipeline as soon as it has three things The rest of the million numbers weren't fed into `foreach`. Information moving down the pipeline is a \"push\" model, but it's controlled by the PowerShell engine.\r\n\r\nAlthough, being a shell, it's not clear what it would mean for \"input failure to suspend computation\" if the input is coming from a native command or something outside a PS cmdlet.\r\n\r\n> Provide \"compiled modules\" similar to how Py files compile to pyc files for performance improvement.\r\n\r\nI think the intended solution for more performance is to write modules in C#. PowerShell code does get JIT compiled, in some situations, but PS team members have said before they have no plan to expose this to end users for customisation, e.g. IIRC [Dongbo Wang's PS Conf Asia talk on the PS Engine internals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Jabuk1gD-Q) Nov 2018. (I guess that could change).\r\n\r\n> Fix null redirection so that the three different ways to redirect output streams to the null device are equivalent in performance.\r\n\r\nDesirable, but it seems unlikely; `$null = 4` is a simple variable bind, `4 | out-null` needs the overhead of starting up a pipeline and doing command resolution - what if someone had intentionally made `out-null`  a proxy-wrapper which added logging code? Is that technical debt, that asking for a pipeline and cmdlet to run is slower than an expression?\r\n\r\n> Fix dynamic scoping:\r\n\r\nIf you mean \"don't use dynamic scoping\", it was a deliberate choice, e.g. [Bruce Payette here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=er9Juk51hgw) saying \"dynamic scoping, this is almost never used; before, like 30 years ago LISP had dynamic scoping, but it's very very rarely used now. The reason that we're using it is: that's what shells use. Shells use the equivalent of dynamic scoping, even Bash, and the Unix shells use the equivalent of dynamic scoping, where the variables from the caller's context - in their case the variables from the caller's context are copied into the child context. [..] With one modification, normally in dynamic scoping you look up the call chain and set the variable where it exists, we don't do that, we set the variable in the current scope all the time, and again that emulates the behaviour of shells\".\r\n\r\nThat might be annoying, but is that \"technical debt\" for a shell, and would be \"zeroTechnicalDebt\" if it was changed?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@jzabroski can you share any details of the script? \r\n\r\nPowershell people try to encourage pipeline streaming (`get-childitem | foreach-object {}`) instead of pre-loading a dataset (`$files = get-childitem; $files | foreach-object`) deliberately to reduce memory use. Did it do that up-front loading?\r\n\r\nWas there a use of `Group-Object` to collect up the similar files? There [have been improvements in Group-Object performance](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7409) recently which would reduce CPU use, if not memory use.\r\n\r\nPowerShell is single-core by default, was there jobs/runspaces code in there, was it a single core server? PS 6.1 has [Start-ThreadJob](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/7169) which allows multiple jobs with way less overhead and throttling to help control CPU use.\r\n\r\n> In my experience, PowerShell makes it easy to write such rubbish\r\n\r\nAll the tutorials and books which tell you to write `$files = @();  $files += $f` must have cost the world a small fortune in cpu cycles and memory. That's a pattern which is slow, expensive of processor and memory, and distressingly common. I'm curious if that pattern was in the script at all? (And if there's any way we could block it without breaking backwards compatibility, or make += invalid on arrays in future breaking-changes?).\r\n\r\nBut, there is a tradeoff here. `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` is 22 characters and eats 800+MB of RAM on just my C: drive, the [C# to do that without using tons of memory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/file-system/how-to-iterate-through-a-directory-tree) is 50+ *lines* and doesn't get file metadata at all, and will be more like 80MB. That's not PS leaking memory, that's PS using it to gain user convenience.\r\n\r\nIs there any language where you don't have to care about the details of how it works, can write useful code, can't write bad code, and don't have to be a skilled programmer? (And which is also a shell?)\r\n\r\nWould any of your earlier proposed changes have made it so the script worked?\r\n\r\nYou can write a Bash script to list files, spawn a process for each one, until your server falls over and you can't even SSH into it. You can write a Python script which `os.walk()`s the file tree and calls `os.stat()` for each file and uses less memory and finishes faster - but takes 10 lines instead of 1 and you still have to care about OS and care about code details (and it still isn't a shell, and won't work with PS Providers).\r\n\r\nI would like PS to have more \"pits of success\" and fewer trip hazards. Fast filename listing being one of them that I see a lot of use for. Radically changing it to be a completely different language, and hobbling the areas it does well, won't do that.\r\n\r\nYou want Python, Python exists, it's a beautiful language, it's not hobbled by trying to fit in two different worlds and keep scoping and function return semantics of a thirty year old shell from a different OS (why, Microsoft), or by Microsoft's commitment to backwards compatibility (and obsession with .Net), so it gets to dodge all those questions, rather than face them.",

I didn't have `Initialize-AWSDefaults` set-up on this PC, and since the script author used ForEach-Object, my stack trace looked like this _garbage_:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\system32> D:\\Installs\\PowerShell\\List-EC2Disks.ps1\r\nCould not access the AWS API, therefore, VolumeId is not available. \r\nVerify that you provided your access keys.\r\nForEach-Object : You cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.\r\nAt D:\\Installs\\PowerShell\\List-EC2Disks.ps1:39 char:12\r\n+ Get-disk | ForEach-Object {\r\n+            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [ForEach-Object], RuntimeException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvokeMethodOnNull,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.ForEachObjectCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens _every single time people use ForEach-Object expressions in their code_.  The stack traces are _always terrible_.  Re-writing this is painful.  Thankfully, it's just a script I copy-paste into a random file, save, and run.  If it's a problem in a large module, I have to get the source code for the module, re-write the script, hope to god in refactoring it I didn't break anything across the module by converting the ForEach-Object expression AND hope I can figure out where the REAL error is just so I can _do my job_.  And now I have some custom code I forked from some major repository, just to figure out why I'm getting some error because PowerShell's `Write-Error` IS AWFUL compared to C# simple idiom of `throw new Exception(\"message\", ex)`.\r\n\r\nRe-writing this to use a `for ($var in $list)`, accumulating the results in a variable `$results`, I get the following error:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\system32> D:\\Installs\\PowerShell\\List-EC2Disks.ps1\r\nCould not access the AWS API, therefore, VolumeId is not available. \r\nVerify that you provided your access keys.\r\nYou cannot call a method on a null-valued expression.\r\nAt D:\\Installs\\PowerShell\\List-EC2Disks.ps1:58 char:26\r\n+ ... lDevice = If ($VirtualDeviceMap.ContainsKey($BlockDeviceName)) { $Vir ...\r\n+                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [], RuntimeException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvokeMethodOnNull\r\n```\r\n\r\nOh, and by the way, every time I have to do this I can't remember PowerShell's stupid rules for adding items to lists, so I have to Google https://www.google.com/search?q=powershell+append+to+list and read a blog post about someone explaining how non-intuitive PowerShell's list operations are.\r\n\r\nIf you don't know C# or a language that does this well, it's easy to argue that this behavior is OK.  However, C# handles this problem intelligently by wrapping the exception in an AggregateException, so that you get both the inner and outer exception.  PowerShell?  Hahahaha.  Yeah, that would be too useful.",

In each of the three different cases, the engineer responded with an expletive when I explained the underlying behavior and why the issue would allegedly never be fixed.\r\n\r\n**To summarize**, terminating errors terminate the script because PowerShell creators believe the script cannot logically proceed beyond the error, but I don't think that is literally ever anyone but the scripter's decision to make on a case-by-case basis.

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT  Here is a similar issue that impedes my productivity.  It's not `$ErrorActionPreference` but `$ConfirmPreference`:\r\n\r\nBelow is an ugly script I wrote for setting SQL Server disk volumes to 64kb.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module Storage;\r\n\r\nfunction Format-Drives\r\n{\r\n    # See https://stackoverflow.com/a/42621174/1040437 (Formatting a disk using PowerShell without prompting for confirmation)\r\n    $currentconfirm = $ConfirmPreference\r\n    $ConfirmPreference = 'none'\r\n\r\n    Get-Disk | Where isOffline | Set-Disk -isOffline $false\r\n    # The next line of this script is (almost) copy-pasted verbatim from: https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/heyscriptingguy/2013/05/29/use-powershell-to-initialize-raw-disks-and-to-partition-and-format-volumes/\r\n    Get-Disk | Where partitionstyle -eq 'raw' | Initialize-Disk -PartitionStyle MBR -Confirm:$false -PassThru | New-Partition -AssignDriveLetter -UseMaximumSize -IsActive | Format-Volume -FileSystem NTFS -AllocationUnitSize 64kb -Confirm:$false\r\n\r\n    # See https://stackoverflow.com/a/42621174/1040437 (Formatting a disk using PowerShell without prompting for confirmation)\r\n    $ConfirmPreference = $currentconfirm\r\n}\r\n\r\nFormat-Drives\r\n```\r\n\r\nCouple of side points:\r\n1. The documentation for `Format-Volume` is wanting for more.  Only two examples?  And the official documentation is not in sync with the website: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-powershell-docs/issues/1170\r\n2. Why do I need to go to StackOverflow to learn how to avoid a GUI for a scripting language?\r\n3. The fact this is so error prone/stupidly hard to get write \"without thinking\" just underlines related issues like https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/198 - it's another example of how Bruce Payette's promise in \"PowerShell In Action\" that you just type what you think is right and it works... is completely and utterly false.\r\n4.

As far as I know, they explicitly **refused** to do so. It doesn't even support semver in **module** versions, never mind in PowerShell itself. The current release plan revs the \"minor\" version annually, and every _other_ release will be supported for an extra \"long\" term (i.e. 25 months instead of 13). All releases between those will rev the \"patch\" and will _probably_ only have security patches and bug fixes. \r\n\r\nThere's simply no plan for [breaking changes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-71?view=powershell-7.1#breaking-changes) even though [they _are_ introduced](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-70?view=powershell-7.1#breaking-changes-and-improvements) in every release. This isn't semantic versioning. This is old-school Windows 95 style versioning: make something up and just do whatever you feel like, as long as the numbers go up, we can explain what we mean.",

    "body": "Isn't `Set-StrictMode` already a \"breaking\" change for most scripts? Yet many people put it at the top of every file to avoid things like access to non-existent variables, while only applying to local scope without affecting other code. So just whack it under 4.0 and call it a day.\r\n\r\nIt would be very valuable to provide tooling checking code for potential breaking changes. Especially for changes related to operator precedence, such tool should emit a warning for all cases where logic changes. `Set-StrictMode -Compatibility OperatorPrecedence` sounds good to me, as it would also allow writing code compatible with both options.
