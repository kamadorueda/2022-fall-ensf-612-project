This case in the parser is meant to handle things like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$ReallySillyLongName.PropertyOneThatIsLong.\r\n    MethodName()\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it does seem to be a bug that if you follow it with whitespace and then a defined operator that it simply processes the property name with either just whitespace or possibly an empty string. This is because the hyphen that starts such an operator is actually a token-separating character and isn't usable as a property name character without encloding is in quotes.\r\n\r\nSo it's trying to be lenient and helpful and ignore the space, but the subsequent breaking character leaves it with a whitespace-only property name -- which it presumably trims to an empty string -- which isn't a defined property name at all, so it gives back $null as you're not working in StrictMode. _Then_ the split operation is actually applied, but it already has nothing to work with, and also returns $null.\r\n\r\n/cc @daxian-dbw seems like a parser bug where it forgets that this should be a parse error if the token is ended before it gets any characters to use for a property name?",

    "body": "@daxian-dbw, I had gathered this so far, but it seems that this doesn't work as designed, because I provided further examples showing that it does not work, specifically with `-split`.  I have since realized that it does work with `-join`.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n@{hello=3}.(-split 'hello') # result is $null\r\n@{hello=3}.('hello') # result is 3\r\n@{hello=3}.$(-split 'hello') # result is 3\r\n@{hello=3}. -join 'hello' # result is 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere seems to be something special going on with `-split` when it supplies the member expression without a full sub-statement context.  This is what I have determined.  `-split` normally returns an array object, but since PowerShell normally unwraps single element arrays, this particular example appears to only output 1 string, but using `get-member -in (-split 'hello')` I can see the array. I am guessing the unwrap doesn't occur when `-split`'s result is passed to the accessor lookup, and it cannot handle the array result, as the operation is not defined.  Using the substatement causes the unwrap, and then the lookup can occur.\r\n\r\nI also want to say that I think this is a bad design.  It leads to confusion as to what later member accesses will actually be accessing.  Of course, this is easy to clarify, by wrapping the expression in parenthesis, but I think the user/programmer should be forced to do that to disambiguate the reference.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n@{hello=3}. -join 'hello'.ToString() # result is [int]3\r\n@{hello=3}.( -join 'hello').ToString() # result is [string]3\r\n```\r\nAbove (first line), the `.ToString()` works against the `'hello'` of the `-join`, and further accessors against the original expression will not happen.   We should be forced to disambiguate this, up front.  When a language is too lax, it can create problems that become hard to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this is just my opinion.  I do wonder, even without strict mode, if an error shouldn't be raised on certain inputs to the accessor member lookup.   What good does an array object, or even numeric values, provide to an accessor member lookup?\r\n\r\nI have learned things from this at any rate.\r\n1. member access is actually an operand (or said as the `.` (or `::`) operator followed by an operand, though it has a strict syntax where the operator must immediately follow the prior object).  I already understood the index access worked that way, and that is easy to see, this was not.  Also, must clarify that this particular operand permits unquoted non-expandable strings, which is what is normally used.\r\n2. any operand can start with a unary operator (while it might seem obvious, its easy to want to just consider pre-unary operators as straight operators, but once you realize they are actually part of the operand, processing syntax suddenly becomes so much easier)\r\n\r\nThis is important because I will use this information in https://github.com/PowerShell/EditorSyntax/pull/156 to improve both the accessor syntax scoping and the general operation in expression mode.",

For a dynamic member access, powershell evaluates the dynamic member expression, and then converts the result to a string. But when the target is an `IDictionary`, it's handled specially -- no string conversion, the result is used directly as the key because `IDictionary` takes an object key. See the code here\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/06391330533c65b464e0c5a62bc3303564ccd324/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs#L1340-L1351\r\n\r\nThe following would work:\r\n```\r\n$s = -split 'hello'\r\n@{$s = 3}. $s\r\n> 3\r\n```\r\n\r\n> I also want to say that I think this is a bad design.

Yes, it provides the ability to use any expression as the member, but we shouldn't abuse it if we want clear and readable code :)\r\n\r\nI do find a bug with indexing a Hashtable, see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9580",
