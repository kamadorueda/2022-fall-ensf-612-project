It exists for an entirely different purpose than InformationalRecord which provides metadata about the runtime state of the engine. In other words, an `InfomationRecord` is  _from_ an application and an `InformationalRecord` is _about_ an application. The name collision is unfortunate but isn't going to change given they're both public classes.\r\n",
