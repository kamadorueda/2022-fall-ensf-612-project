    "body": "Engine WG discussed this issue today.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion of ETS properties is unlikely to be a feasible solution here, because `[string]` is treated by the ETS system almost like a value type (like `[int]`, for example). The result of this is that ETS properties and methods applied to strings don't \"stick\"; in many cases, simply saving the value into a new variable causes the ETS properties to be 'lost' and not be present on the value in the new variable, among other possible sticking points.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth looking into whether it's possible to have the leaf nodes behave as normal XmlElement entities (retain their original type) while adding some logic to the conversion paths for XmlElement in order to make these leaf nodes behave more like ordinary strings when needed.\r\n\r\nThe implementation is likely to require significant effort as it would require changes to the XmlAdapter, and it's not currently a priority. We're leaving this as up for grabs for the time being. We would need to see an initial prototype that attempts to solve this issue before we can meaningfully evaluate whether the change is something we can take on. It is likely an RFC would be required at some point as well so that all the details and any necessary breaking changes can be properly evaluated.",
