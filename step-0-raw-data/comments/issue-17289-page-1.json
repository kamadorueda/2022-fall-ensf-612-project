    "body": "This is not a specifically PowerShell problem. If you create a Zip from Windows explorer the same thing happens. \r\n\r\nThere is a note in the WikiPedia entry for ZIP https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format) \r\n\r\n> The ZIP format has no notion of time zone , so timestamps are only meaningful if it is known what time zone they were created in.\r\n\r\nWhen ZIP was first invented machines only had \"local\" time, and no concept of which time zone the were in. Windows could switch to writing UTC time to ZIPs and assuming ZIPs used UTC, but since most files are zipped and unzipped where they are created this would mean than all existing files not on UTC time would be changed, and moving between old and new software would also change file dates. Rather than deal with _this_ problem Microsoft (and I think other vendors) continue to live with \r\nthe problem of files moving time zones. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Edit** http://www.pkware.com/appnote has details of the zip format with this \r\n\r\n>   4.4.6 date and time fields: (2 bytes each)\r\n>     The date and time are encoded in standard MS-DOS format... MS-DOS time format is different  from more commonly used computer time formats such as  UTC. For example, MS-DOS uses year values relative to 1980 and 2 second precision. \r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"/static/favicon/wikipedia.ico\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format)\">ZIP (file format) - Wikipedia</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
