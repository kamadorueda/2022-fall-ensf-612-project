I don't think they need to know if a parameter they used was mandatory, because they used it, so who cares.\r\n\r\nIf they did not use a mandatory parameter, then they need to be told that parameter such-and-such is required, but in that case they are prompted for input, so again, who cares, because for the end user it doesn't really need to be part of the error message.\r\n\r\nBehind the scenes the category info or the fully qualified error id can indicate the actual source of the issue so that a command author can identify where the error comes from.",
