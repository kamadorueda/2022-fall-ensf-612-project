Though in my case, my results have been intermittently successful from PowerShell Core on a Mac, (worked the first time, didn't work any subsequent times until moments ago), and completely unsuccessful from Windows Powershell 5.1 on a Windows Server 2016 box. Registering the repository and trying to install a module results in the same message: `WARNING: Unable to resolve package source 'https://REDACTED.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/REDACTED/nuget/v2/'`. I was able to publish my package and can see the package using the nuget CLI on both systems, but that is using the V3 URL. ",

    "body": "I would tend to agree that this is an issue with PowerShellGet and/or possibly PackageManagement.\r\n\r\nI believe I have figured out why my experience was seemingly intermittent on PowerShell Core and just didn't work on Windows Powershell. I had added a nuget source for my repository using the V3 URL following the tutorial referenced above and it was named identically to my PSRepo. I don't understand why, but operations for that PSRepo always failed with the unable to resolve package source warning. When I changed my nuget source to use the V2 URL and restarted my PowerShell session, it worked. My experience in Core was seemingly intermittent because I had not restarted my PowerShell session after changing my nuget source URL. Since it didn't appear to work in Core I never tried it in Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nI've swapped out the URL for my nuget source in PowerShell Core and Windows PowerShell 5.1, restarted my sessions and I am no longer seeing the issue.",
