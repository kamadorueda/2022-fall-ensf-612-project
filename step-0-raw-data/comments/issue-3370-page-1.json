PowerShell has the great verb-noun concept. We should not break it, because it allows us to use PowerShell in a very intuitive way.\r\n2. I'm pretty sure it's a great concept to hide complexity in Modules, so that users of our modules do not have to remember to use\r\n> $data = [AB[]]$(\r\n>     @{a=\"dd\";b=\"aa\"}\r\n>     @{a=\"cc\";b=\"zz\"}\r\n>     @{a=\"cc\";b=\"mm\"})\r\n> $data | Sort-Object -Property @{e={\"{0}{1}\" -f $_.a,$_.b}}\r\n\r\n… just to get business objects in the right order.\r\n\r\n3. To add a -sort argument to a Get-SpecialThing cmdlet breaks the great verb-noun rule, because we would like to Sort something and not to get something in a sorted way.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\n1. The best way to sort Complex Objects should be Sort-BusinessObjects. Because it has the expected verb-noun naming: Sort a Business Object.\r\n2. It does not make to reserve Verbs for internal commands, just to have them reserved. ;-)\r\n\r\nYou probably recognize that english is my foreign language and I'm fighting with words. A lot. :-)",

    "body": "First, I totally ack that certain objects and types require complex business logic for proper sorting. That's a very real business problem, so the question from here is \"what's the right technical solution to solve that business problem?\"\r\n\r\nAFAIK, the original intention of reserving `Sort` was to discourage users from writing all sorts of custom sorting cmdlets that are incompatible with one another. The fact that anything *can* be sorted with `Sort-Object` lends itself to being the \"One True Way\" to sort objects. For discoverability's sake, you don't have users having to cycle through `Sort-Int`, `Sort-String`, `Sort-MyObjectFoo`, etc. until they get the right one. \r\n\r\nFrom that perspective, I think the right solution here is to expose some sort of way for you to implement the proper custom sort method in your own output type. For instance, maybe if you implement a `SortObject` method for your output type, we run that thing by default with `Sort-Object` (or maybe you put an attribute on some method or whatever, you get the point). \r\n\r\nThat way, you can house that custom logic in the cmdlet itself, and users can continue to use `Sort-Object` as they would with any other object. \r\n\r\nSide note @schittli: your English is fantastic. I genuinely didn't notice until you said something. Thanks for being patient with us. 👍 ",
