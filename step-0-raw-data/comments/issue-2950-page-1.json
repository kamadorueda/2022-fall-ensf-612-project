I initially left all the GroupPolicy registry checks in place because we do not currently have support for those actions in PowerShell Core on non-Windows platforms.\r\n\r\nIn this specific instance of transcription, a bunch of new code would be needed to hook into logging mechanisms on the various non-Windows OSs that we support, so it is a much larger task than just storying the GroupPolicy value in a config file.",
