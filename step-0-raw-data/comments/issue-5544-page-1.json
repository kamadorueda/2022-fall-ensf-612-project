So I think we need another abstraction name.\r\n\r\nWhy? To me, the confusion stems only from `[System.IO.Path]::PathSeparator`, but I don't think we should worry about that - it's .NET's confusion, not PowerShell's.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, we're looking for the character that is used to separate item names that are sequenced to form a path - `PathSeparator` seems like the most intuitive choice to me.\r\n\r\nI guess `ItemSeparator` would work too, but to me it's preferable to mention the relevant concept in the name: a _path_ [of item names].\r\n\r\n> I'd expect that .Net Core `[System.IO.Path]::PathSeparator` transforms to `ItemSeparator`.\r\n\r\n`[System.IO.Path]::PathSeparator` has no relationship to providers per se, and shouldn't be reflected there - it's a character used by convention to separate _paths as a whole_ in a _reserved environment variable_ (and, as an aside, is itself a legal filename character on its respective platforms). Whether and where to represent this other separator in PowerShell too is a separate question; my name suggestion would be `PathVariableSeparator`.\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, we have `Join-Path`. If we had a `PathSeparator` parameter there, what would it mean? Again confuse.\r\n\r\nIn line with the new property, it would refer to the separator used to separate item names in a path - where is the confusion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
