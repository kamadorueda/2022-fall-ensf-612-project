    "body": "It's simply that the range operator functions _everywhere_, not just with respect to an array. Having `1..-4` work the same way regardless of where it's used means you know what you're going to get, and you can inspect what's going on when you get unexpected results by simply displaying the result of `1..-4` -- if it changed behaviour when used in an array or other indexer, it would be impossible to reliably inspect or diagnose an issue with any accuracy. \r\n\r\nC#8 introduced a new operator `^` which is specifically used to create a separate `Index` and `Range` object types that is designed to work relative to collections. We could borrow that part of the approach and have a syntax like this: `$a[0..^4]` which would _always_ go until the 4th-from-the-end index in the array, whatever numbered index that might be.\r\n\r\nWhether we need to introduce a new object type for this, or just reuse the new `Index` and `Range` types now available in .NET Core, this would be a valuable addition to the language and I believe has been discussed before... in #7940 ",
