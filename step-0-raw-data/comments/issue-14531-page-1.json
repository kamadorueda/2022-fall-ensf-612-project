    "body": "> 1. If it is typical behavior why do we need new parameter? I'd expect you request to change the cmdlet behavior to make it standard.\r\n\r\nIf you sent a POST request to a REST API, using PowerShell, and you forgot to explicitly define `https://` in the URL, would you like the HTTP method to remain as POST and not get converted to GET? The answer would likely be yes, and I think that's a valid use case. It's interesting to note that [cURL](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) offers this parameter idea, but for just POST methods, via --post301, --post302 and --post303.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm aware this is a feature request but if I've done it wrong please tell me.\r\n\r\n> 2. Could you please make more investigation? What do any standards say about this? What is behavior of others popular clients (curl, wget, IE, ...)? Please add links (to docs) if possible.\r\n\r\nI believe [section 6.4](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7231.txt) will helps us here. This quote from a note at the start of that section is interesting:\r\n\r\n```\r\n      Note: In HTTP/1.0, the status codes 301 (Moved Permanently) and\r\n      302 (Found) were defined for the first type of redirect\r\n      ([RFC1945], Section 9.3).  Early user agents split on whether the\r\n      method applied to the redirect target would be the same as the\r\n      original request or would be rewritten as GET.  Although HTTP\r\n      originally defined the former semantics for 301 and 302 (to match\r\n      its original implementation at CERN), and defined 303 (See Other)\r\n      to match the latter semantics, prevailing practice gradually\r\n      converged on the latter semantics for 301 and 302 as well.  The\r\n      first revision of HTTP/1.1 added 307 (Temporary Redirect) to\r\n      indicate the former semantics without being impacted by divergent\r\n      practice.  Over 10 years later, most user agents still do method\r\n      rewriting for 301 and 302; therefore, this specification makes\r\n      that behavior conformant when the original request is POST.\r\n```",

Most people would simply change the `-Uri` parameter to be `https://` and get on with their lives.\r\n\r\nHowever, where this feature request will be most helpful is for module authors. For example, for modules which are written for a web service's REST API. Perhaps a parameter for each function in said module allowed the user to specify a URL to their target host/service and they passed `example.com` to said parameter. By default, most HTTP agents will send out the request over tcp/80 and the majority of web servers today will respond with a redirect to `https://example.com`. As it stands today, if the function of the module was to HTTP POST, that would get rewritten as HTTP GET and potentially produce erroneous results.\r\n\r\nThis puts module authors in a bit of a dilemma of sorts. Questions like \"Do I try and look out for the redirect response and handle that within my code?\" or \"Should I force the parameter to only accept `https://`?\". Having this new parameter to persist the original HTTP method would simplify that common situation for modules which are essentially REST API wrappers.",

Otherwise, yes, exactly, 307 is arguably what REST API web servers should be using. \r\n\r\nAs a starting point, I think support for the new parameter(s) should focus on only 301, 302 and 303 status codes.\r\n\r\nFor my needs, just one switch parameter `-PersistHTTPMethod` for all three status codes would be fine. However I can imagine there may be others out there that might want more granularity e.g. same parameter name but accept a string array of four possible values: `301`, `302`, `303` and `All` - allowing the user to pass a combination of status codes. \r\n\r\nAn alternative might be three switch parameters `-PersistHTTPMethod301`, `-PersistHTTPMethod302` and `-PersistHTTPMethod303` however that would add noise to the parameter list for the cmdlets - it depends how \"offended\" the team is with that.",
