    "body": "@mklement0 Yeah it doesn't fix *this* issue, but before if there was an object that *only* had an explicitly implemented indexer (like all `Tuple`'s), it just wouldn't find an indexer.  My PR made it so if it doesn't find any indexer, it then checks for explicitly implemented indexers.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think it's probably *fine* to always check so it can find the best \"match\", but part of me also thinks that this is the more \"correct\" route.  I say that because in order for you to invoke that indexer in C# you'd have to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nJObject obj = GetJObjectSomehow();\r\n((IList<JToken>)obj)[10];\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe point of explicitly implementing something is typically to hide it except in specific scenarios.  Typically it's more advisable to use the implicit implementation.  Ideally you'd be able to do something like that in PowerShell:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n([IList[JToken]]$obj)[10]\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut unfortunately you can't really cast as something that isn't a concrete type.  Well you can, but it won't actually effect anything since `$obj` technically already is `IList[JToken]` and PowerShell doesn't remember that you cast that to customize binding.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting that `JObject` implements `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider` which means in most cases PowerShell is going to let `JObject` decide how it's bound. This problem does exist in PowerShell's binder as well, but PowerShell might also defer binding to `JObject` in this case.",

    "body": "Good stuff, @SeeminglyScience, thanks.\r\n\r\nI do see the point re requiring an explicit action to call the explicitly implemented interface method in general, and in C# it makes perfect sense, given that a simple cast will do that.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as you point out, we don't have that option in PowerShell  - and the workaround via reflection, as now shown in the OP, is quite cumbersome.\r\n\r\nMore generally, interfaces are not on the average PowerShell user's mind, if I were to guess, and seeing a method / property in `Get-Member's` output for a given type leads to a reasonable expectation that it can actually be called. The conditions under which they can't are far from obvious.\r\n\r\nThat said, perhaps this is too exotic a scenario to worry about - especially if the fix would come with an always-paid performance penalty - so perhaps the pragmatic solution is to simply _document_ the issue.\r\n\r\n@lzybkr, any thoughts?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn a side note, @SeeminglyScience, since you mention `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`:\r\n\r\nI've noticed that, for example, `[JObject]` instances do not have the usual hidden properties such as `.psobject` and `.pstypenames`; e.g., `[Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject]::Parse('{\"foo\":1}').pstypenames` yields `$null`.\r\n\r\nIs this (a) due to delegating to `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`, and (b) as designed?\r\n",

    "body": "> If an overload match is found as a direct member, explicit interface implementations aren't consulted for more specific matches - this is by design, not least because changing this would be a performance concern.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, I did purposefully add the check for explicit implementations only as a fallback, but truthfully I wasn't considering the scenario of calculating the best overload to use.  It was more of a \"if we already found one, we probably don't need to find more\" type of thing.  Would it be a performance hit? Yeah for sure.  Would it be impactful? Ehhhh only benchmarks could tell.  The binder is cached so I would think it would be pretty minimal.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to get at is that saying it's by design on my part would be generous.  I think it mostly makes sense the way it is, or rather not particularly worth changing. But if you disagree I encourage you to switch it up in the binder and run some benchmarks.\r\n\r\n> The latter is currently broken in some situations, presumably relating to types that implement `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`, so a fix is needed.\r\n\r\nA fix is needed for sure, what's unclear is who needs to fix what.  It seems bizarre to me that their convert binder wouldn't account for interfaces.  Maybe PowerShell should swallow the exception depending on where it happens. Maybe it should approach conversions for IDMOP more delicately, but imo that's kind of the point of `IDMOP`, especially in PowerShell.  My gut reaction is that the fix should be in Json.NET but I haven't looked closely enough at the PowerShell side to see if there's something better it could do there.",
