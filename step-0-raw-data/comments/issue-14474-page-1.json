    "body": "In short: The behavior is by design.\r\n\r\nAlso, unless you're reasonably sure that you've found a problem with PowerShell itself, please don't post here and use one of the following resources instead, at least until you're sure you've found an actual problem: \r\n\r\n* The [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/powershell/shared_invite/enQtMzA3MDcxNTM5MTkxLTBmMWIyNzhkYzVjNGRiOTgxZmFlN2E0ZmVmOWU5NDczNTY2NDFhZjFlZTM1MTZiMWIzZDcwMGYzNjQ3YTRkNWM) and [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/AtzXnJM) community chat forums (they seamless talk to each other).\r\n \r\n* Q&A site [StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/powershell) and the [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org/forums/) forum for searching or posting questions about PowerShell.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRe example 1:\r\n\r\n* After assignment `$IssueObject = $SourceArray[0]`, both `$IssueObject` and `$SourceArray[0]` by design point to the very same `[pscustomobject]` instance.\r\n\r\n* Creating a new variable is not the same as creating a _copy_ of the RHS value - that only applies to .NET _value types_, whereas `[pscustomobject]` is an instance of a _reference type_.\r\n   * See [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/45071111/45375) for more information.\r\n\r\n* To create a (shallow) copy of a `[pscustomobject]` instance, call its `.psobject.Copy()` method.\r\n\r\n* `Select-Object`, when used with `-Property` (positionally implied) always creates a _new_ (`[pscustomobject]`) instance (except if `-ExpandProperty` is passed), but note that `Select-Object *` with an `[pscustomobject]` input isn't always the same as calling `.psobject.Copy()` on that input, because only _properties_ are copied; also, the new object reports its type name as `Selected.System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject`.\r\n\r\nNote that both methods of copying properties create _shallow_ copies, which means the property values are copied as-is, so that again you get _data copies_ for value-type instances and _reference copies_ for reference-type instances.\r\n\r\nThere is no general mechanism for _deep_ copying (cloning), though individual types may implement one.\r\n\r\nRe example 2:\r\n\r\nWhat `Get-Service` outputs are so-called _live objects_ (of type [`System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController)) . \r\nThat is, their properties reflect the _current state_ of the resource being pointed to instead of taking a _snapshot_ of the state.\r\n\r\nIt is up to each type to implement one behavior or the other, and this aspect is independent of the question of when a copy of the actual data vs. a reference to the same object is created.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to get a snapshot of a service-info object is to use `Select-Object *` to create a `[pscustomobject]` whose properties then contain _static_ copies of those properties in the original that are _calculated properties_ (properties whose value is determined dynamically, on very access) - but note that for non-calculated properties whose values happen to be instance of reference types you'll again get copies of the _references_.\r\n\r\n",

I personally find this very counter-intuitive. The two examples here came from two different people who were as confused as I was. So even if it isn't a bug, I thought it was useful to be mentioned here as behavior that raises questions.\r\n\r\nAs my wondering has been cleared up I will close this issue, thank you all for your responses",
