Even if you're supplying invalid credentials (e.g. user@example.com with password Password123), if PowerShell can at least initiate the connection attempt to Office 365, even if Office365 says invalid username or password, this shows that PowerShell can connect, however it can't test if any remote commands can be executed.",
