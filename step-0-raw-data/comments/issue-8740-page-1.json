However, after debugging this, it appears that for a function to be visible in the current session, it is \"exported\" and then \"imported\".  So you would see both verbose messages.  This seems by-design, but certainly a bit confusing.  Perhaps we could change the \"Exporting function ...\" message to something else to make it more obvious.  However, since I haven't seen lots of mention about this, putting it up-for-grabs on a suggestion.",

You get the two verbose messages so if something isn't exported, you can tell at what level the problem exists i.e. wasn't exported at the `.psm1` level or it wasn't exported at the `.psd1` level making, it easier to debug.",
