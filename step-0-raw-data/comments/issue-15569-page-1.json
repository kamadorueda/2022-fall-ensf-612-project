    "body": "Somewhat related is this [issue](https://github.com/Azure/powershell/issues/39) I submitted to the Azure DevOps repo that provides the `powershell` / `pwsh` steps.  The steps as implemented are not really good for CI/CD.  There are several embarrassing cases where they give false positives - indicate `PASS` when the step has obviously failed if you look at the log output.  This is a bad look for PowerShell.  FWIW the Jenkins `durable-task-plugin` had a very similar issue.  I got a PR merged to address the issue the same way I suggest addressing it in the Azure DevOps issue.  \r\n\r\nThis change would likely have caused the script to bomb out and FAIL the step after the Import-Module failure.   Wrapping the script in a `try/catch` does change the script's behavior but in general it makes the script fail more which you can deal with in your script IF you don't want a non-terminating error to stop your script.",
