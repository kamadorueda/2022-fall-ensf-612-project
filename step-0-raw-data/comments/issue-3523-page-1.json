The RFC should also consider other approaches as well, such as:\r\n- Lexical scoping vs dynamic scope\r\n- Reusing ErrorActionPreference (such as 'StopIncludingNativeCommand' or 'Stop','IncludeNativeCommand')\r\n- Add a new (boolean) variable (such as $PSIncludeNativeCommandInErrorActionPreference)\r\n- Update the Set-StrictMode",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT In place of this, how about providing the community with a hook ala `CommandNotFoundAction`.  Something like `PostNativeCommandInvocationAction` that would pass to the handler the exit code of the native command (along with the process args).  Then the community could experiment with approaches (functions/scripts/modules) that hook this action to cause a non-zero exit code to fail.  Could be as simple as a module with a function like `Enable-ThrowOnNativeCommandFailure ` e.g.:\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Enable-ThrowOnNativeCommandFailure {\r\n    $global:ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.PostNativeCommandInvocationAction= {\r\n        param($Name, $EventArgs)\r\n        if ($EventArgs.ExitCode) {\r\n            throw \"$Name $($EventArgs.Args) failed with exit code $($EventArgs.ExitCode)\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n} \r\n```\r\nOr maybe instead of throwing directly in the action handler, there could be a property on `$EventArgs` we could set to indicate it should throw back to the invoker of the native command.  Might be nice if we could provide some aspects of the exception message. \r\n\r\nI have to say that as someone pushing PowerShell into `critical build systems`, I've gotten more than a few crusty looks when a PowerShell script has obviously failed when you look at the log file yet the build system (Jenkins, TFS Build) reports success.  This has been a **real** pain point for my dev team especially as other teams are trying to push Python for build scripts (blech!).",

It looks like you already had a code PR open in PowerShell/PowerShell#3523. Would you be interested in updating that one? We'd really love for this to land in PowerShell 7.1, but we would need it to be landed (including through review) by end of August in order to make our RC release. If this isn't something you think you can commit to, let us know here, as we could potentially commit engineers from the PS team to work on it.",
