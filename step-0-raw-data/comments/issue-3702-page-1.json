    "body": "This is actually by design, though it may not be obvious:\r\n\r\nPowerShell collects stdout output from calls to external utilities as an _array of lines_.\r\n\r\nThus, your `cat test.txt` command results in 2-element array `` \"a`tb\", \"c\" ``.\r\n\r\nIn the context of string interpolation, PowerShell represents an array as the concatenation of its elements separated by `$OFS`, which defaults to a single space.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the string-interpolated value of array `` \"a`tb\", \"c\" `` is `` \"a`tb c\" ``, which is what you saw.\r\nIncidentally, you'd get the same result with `Get-Content` without the `-Raw` switch.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways around this:\r\n\r\n* Use `Get-Content -Raw`, which reads the entire file as a single string:\r\n\r\n`\"$(Get-Content -raw test.txt)\"`\r\n\r\n* Use the `-join` operator on the output captured from `cat`:\r\n\r\n``\"$((cat test.txt) -join \"`n\")\"``\r\n\r\n* Set `$OFS` to a newline - note the call via a script block and `&` to ensure that the `$OFS` change is localized:\r\n\r\n``& { $OFS=\"`n\"; \"$(cat test.txt; )\" }``\r\n\r\n\r\n",
