Seems like we should explicitly remove the old key during setup.\r\n\r\nAs for the title, the simplest solution is to remove the `-Command` to update the title which would bring back the startup text (as `-Command` causes it to be suppressed) and when elevated the `Administrator:` prefix doesn't get overwritten.  The downside is you get the path to exe which doesn't seem horrible to me.  Otherwise we'd have to add more to `-Command` to know when it's elevated to add the prefix as well as enable the startup info to show with `-Command` which is more code to change.  My preference is to just go with reverting the `-Command` parameter from the command line.",

    "body": "If component codes are being managed properly, then this should not happen.\r\n\r\nIn general, if an MSI \"inplace upgrade over\" a previous MSI product does unexpected things that are resolved by uninstall / clean new install - it is because MSI Component GUIDs are not being properly managed **across package releases**.  Basically, they aren't being kept the same across packages as per MSI rules.  The MSI Component is actually the most durable identity in MSI because the same exact binary with the same version should have the same component GUID across all MSI packages (including \"MSI major upgrades\") and across all time.  In the case of shared runtimes, MSI Merge modules were intended to keep component GUIDs matching across all vendors shipping shared runtimes.\r\n\r\nThis is how Microsoft office used to manage 1.5 GB of code and have sensible upgrades all the time.\r\n\r\nFirst, these context menu associations should be **in the same component as the exe they point to**.\r\n\r\nSecond, **the MSI component code for that EXE should stay the same for major versions of the EXE across packages**.\r\n\r\nThird, Keypaths should not change between minor MSI package version upgrades.  Keypaths for a component include registry keys and file system paths when those components have that as their key path.  However, If this component was structured properly, the binary file path would be the keypath and then I *believe* the registry path of the association should be able to vary.\r\n\r\nWindows installer deals with \"MSI Components\" as the fundamental unit of installation - an entire component is installed, uninstalled, self-healed and upgraded as a unit.  Components whose IDs stay the same, but the version changes, should automatically not leave junk over.\r\n\r\nComponents based on EXE keypaths should take their version number from the binary version of the EXE - which also assumes it is appropriately managed according to MSI rules (which don't really differ from normal major, minor, build rules).\r\n\r\nWhen I used to teach windows installer I had an exercise to emphasize this point.  In the exercise, because component codes for identical items did NOT match across major upgrade packages, after an upgrade the only file left on the system was one that was ONLY in the new package.  Because component ref counts didn't match for the exact same files across two packages.",

As far as I see an old preview of 6.1 is causing that, therefore this should not bother us too much. However, when it comes to RTM releases, Microsoft must go through some manual test cases to ensure everything is fine since there were substantial changes to the installer during 6,1 that could possibly cause this to happen for the 6.1->6.2 upgrade. Unfortunately this scenario is very hard to test/reproduce locally now, I would need to extract the original product id guid for simulating a more realistic upgrade scenario and then my locally built installers would probably still be different to an actual release.",
