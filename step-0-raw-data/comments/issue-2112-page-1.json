    "body": "This presents some interesting implementation issues. To truly support Multipart form data, the Cmdlets would need to accept multiple files, a field name for each file, possibly a content type for each file, and the ability to accept a dictionary of field/value pairs at the same time. Additionally, It appears some APIs are particular about the boundary used, so an optional boundary would need to be supplied.  Attempting to make that mesh with the current Cmdlets would be a significant rework almost to the point of justifying separate cmdlets for Multipart support.\r\n\r\nThe issue is in Multipart form data being extremely flexible and radically different from other requests. It would be easy to tack on support for a single file or to convert a `-Body` dictionary, but it would not be simple to mix a file with form data or to support multiple files. Fitting all the Multipart use-cases into the current cmdlets would touch a large portion of code to accommodate a valid but somewhat less common usage of the cmdlets. \r\n\r\nIMO, It would also lead to a somewhat confusing UX. If `-InFile` was used for Multipart files and only accepted multiple files on a Multipart request it would lead to issues with users supplying multiple paths on a standard request, getting errors, and wondering why it accepts an array of paths. Also, explaining that `-Body` and `-InFile` are mutually exclusive except when doing Multipart requests would be somewhat confusing confusing. If files were split into a separate and new parameter like `-MultipartFile`, that might cause confusion as to why `-InFile` doesn't work on Multipart requests or why there needs to be a difference in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe problem I see with simplifying this is that many of the requests I've read for sending Multipart form data through PowerShell have only their own use-case in mind. It might seem simple from that perspective, but when you look a dozen or so of these requests you begin to see they almost all are distinctly different needs falling under the broad category of Multipart form data. A Narrow implementation would leave many use-cases in their current state, a broad implementation would impact a lot of code but for feature addition that is less commonly used. \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I think a fair compromise and better approach would be to accept a `-Body` object/collection that can be used by the Cmdlets to create the Multipart Form-Data Request. This could be simplified by exposing new cmdlet(s) and new classes to simplify generating that object/collection. Body could simply be adapted to accept `MultipartFormDataContent` at least easing the burden of the user managing an `HttpClient`.\r\n\r\nI could start by adding support for `MultipartFormDataContent` in `-Body`. From there it could be decided to add convenience cmdlets or possibly even wrapper classes to easy creation.\r\n\r\n @JamesWTruher @dantraMSFT @PaulHigin @SteveL-MSFT  What are your thoughts? ",

    "body": "@markekraus FWIW, here is the modified function from Mario's blog.\r\n\r\nThe main addition was the Basic Authentication headers which also required a Base64 encoded version of the authentication credentials. Initially, I decrypted the `PSCredential` password via a separate function, however this was changed to a single line. The Basic Authroziation header is required as although you can provide simple credentials to the the `HTTPClient` (and indeed the `Invoke-WebRequest`), the first request is sent without this header, which is then challenged, thus a second request is made. This means that then entire 1 GB file is uploaded twice - a huge waste of time and resources.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I have a similar issue (WRT the Basic Authorisation Header) when downloading a large file (3-4 GB), again again leads to a two request issue, and the download of the file is actioned twice), However the `Invoke-WebRequest` is even worse in that case as the entire file is streamed into memory and cause the remote server to lock up when I tried to use this CmdLet. I eventually changed to use the `WebClient` (I couldn't get the `HTTPClient` to work with my lacking programming knowledge) , however, `WebClient` doesn't implement a `timeout` property so you have to build a class to inherit and extend the WebClient. All very, very complex and confusing, especially to someone like me with little programming expertise.

It is time to consider some simplified limited implementations.\r\n\r\nWhat I think can be done without much pain and without making any breaking changes is to add `multipart/form-data` support to dictionary `-Body`'s and `-Infile`. This would be facilitated with something like `-AsMultipart` switch. \r\n\r\nIn the case of `-InFile` there would only be support for a single file and it would be added as a `StreamContent`. The `-ContentType` parameter, since it would otherwise be ignore, can be re-purposed for specifying the mime type of the file. \r\n\r\nThe `-Body` dictionary would be converted into `StringContent`. The Key's would be field names and the values would be the content.\r\n\r\nFinally, when `-AsMultipart` is supplied, the `-InFile` and `-Body` dictionary can be used together for a mixed content submission. \r\n\r\nThis would add support for many basic use cases, but would not address complex `multipart/form-data` submissions or multiple files in a single submission. For those use cases, the `MultipartFormDataContent` will still need to be manually created and supplied.\r\n\r\nThis would also require some error detection, such as when something other than a dictionary is supplied to `-Body` when `-AsMultipart` is used. Also, the `-ContentType` will probably cause issues if it is not a valid type (will need to verify). The current logic for conflict resolution between `-Body` and `-InFile` will have to be revisited.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov Can you add/change the label `Area-Cmdlets-Utility`. I'm trying to make it easier to see all the web cmdlet issues. \r\n\r\n",

I guess in those cases use could still create their own `MultipartFormDataContent` and supply it to `-Body`. Then there is the question of how to escape `@` in something like this `irm -Form @{TwitterUsername=\"@markekraus\"}`.  and how escape that escape sequence... etc.\r\n\r\nusing something like that would definitely make the internal logic easier to deal with and would make multiple file uploads available. \r\n\r\n",

I believe we are already efficient on the sending side. I think that problem for sending did exist in earlier versions, but since Core change to the HttpClient, I don't think it is an issue anymore. I have not looked deeply into the receiving side as that direction is complicated by all of the processing we do after the `HttpClient` call.",

String values will be processed as `StringContent`. `FileInfo` and `Stream` will be processed as `StreamContent`. Any other value type will be the result of `LanguagePrimitives.ConvertTo<string>()` and send as `StringContent`. The `Content-Type` of files and streams will be `application/octet-stream`. When `-Form` is supplied the method will be `POST` and anything passed to `-Method` and `-ContentType` will be ignored . `-Form` will be exclusive to `-Body` and `-InFile` and an terminating error will occur if they are used together.\r\n\r\nNote that users needing more control or advanced Multipart features may still create and supply a `MultipartFormDataContent` object to the `-Body` parameter as provided in #4782.",

However, I have just run the same basic tests using `Invoke-WebRequest` to GET a large file in v6 and v5 simultaneously and honestly there is a HUGE difference - whoever made these changes to the implementation here need some applause as well - even if this is the wrong place!",

    "body": "An update for anyone following this issue. I am currently working on implementing the solution as approved by the PowerShell Committee with some minor adjustments. I hope to have a PR submitted in the coming days.\r\n\r\nAfter reading RFC-7578 it became clear that a single field name can be supplied multiple times with different field values. The use case for this is an array of files (multiple file selection) or values for a single form field. To accommodate that, I'm adjusting the implementation slightly to treat collections as multiple field values for the same field name.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Form = @{\r\n    Files = Get-ChildItem c:\\temp -File\r\n    Names = \"Bill\", \"Sue\", \"Jane\"\r\n    Cars = [System.Collections.Generic.List[String]]::new([String[]]@(\"Smart\", \"Honda\"))\r\n    Description = \"Multiple and single value support.\"\r\n    Image = [System.IO.FileInfo]\"c:\\picture\\me.png\"\r\n}\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Method POST -Uri $uri -Form $Form\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the approved implementation, this would result in a collection being converted to a single string. In the implementation I am working on, `Names` would be supplied 3 times with `Bill` as the first value, `Sue` as the second, and `Jane` as the third. It doesn't add much complexity and initial testing shows it works for endpoints that support it. It provides more flexibility at minimal cost. After checking, I personally have an internal use case for this in a form that requires multiple values for a single field.",
