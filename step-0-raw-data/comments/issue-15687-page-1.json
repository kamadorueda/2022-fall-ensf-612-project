    "body": "Check `Get-Module ActiveDirectory`; I suspect pwsh is loading it in a compatibility session, which will make it run inside a hidden PSv5.1 process and thus a separate environment than your actual pwsh session, so the variable won't be found. If it is, you'll see the ActiveDirectory module reported as a script module with (I think?) a version reported as `0.0.0` or similar.\r\n\r\nYou can try importing the module into pwsh directly with `Import-Module ActiveDirectory -SkipEditionCheck` and see if you get better results there. From memory, on newer servers the ActiveDirectory module has been updated and should auto-import correctly.\r\n\r\nYou may still have issues on a 2016 box, though, even with forcing the module to be imported; there were some outstanding bugs in the module running on .NET Core that needed to be fixed, if memory serves.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to ignore all of the above and simply change your filter syntax. As @Northman-de mentions, scriptblock syntax is (at best) a bit of a lie, and the documentation should never have been written that way IMO. The AD module converts it to a string and then re-parses the string manually looking for variables, which just flat out breaks in anything but the most typical and obvious cases. Changing the parameter syntax as they suggest should allow the values to be properly evaluated by pwsh instead of the AD module, and generally has a better success rate in general.",

    "body": "Windows 10 Build 14393 is from 2016 which is most likely not marked as comptaible with .NET core and as @vexx32 says it will load in an implicit remoting session. AFAIK it was in Server 2019 that the ActiveDirectory module was updated to support .NET Core and will run natively in PowerShell. Any of it's operations are run in a separate process and runspace and does not have access to any of your vars so it won't be able to find `$employeeNumber` when it converts that scriptblock to the LDAP filter. A third option not mentioned is to run the cmdlet and store the variable in that runspace like\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$employeeNumber = \"000\"\r\n\r\n$winSession = New-PSSession -UseWindowsPowerShell\r\ntry {\r\n    Invoke-Command -Session $winSession -ScriptBlock {\r\n        # $using:employeeNumber will tell PowerShell to get the value from the outside Runspace\r\n        $employeeNumber = $using:employeeNumber\r\n        Get-ADUser -Filter {employeeNumber -eq $employeeNumber} | select name\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nfinally {\r\n    $winSession | Remove-PSSession\r\n}\r\n```",
