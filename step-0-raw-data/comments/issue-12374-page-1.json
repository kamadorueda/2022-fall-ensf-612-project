    "body": "PowerShell's `-f` operator provides access to the [`System.String.Format`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.String.Format) .NET functionality, which supports only _indexed_ format items (placeholders).\r\n\r\nWhile _named_ placeholders would be nice, I don't think we want to overlay the .NET functionality with a custom layer of additional functionality, not least for the implementation challenges that would ensue.\r\n\r\n#11412 has previously asked for named placeholders, which led me to suggest relying on the existing string-interpolation syntax (expandable strings) instead and allowing _on demand_ expansion of string literals acting as _templates_, via a hypothetical new `Expand-String` cmdlet: #11693\r\nNote that, as with the current string interpolation, this requires making the values to be formatted a direct part of the string - not separate arguments.\r\n\r\nHowever, just like current string interpolation that wouldn't directly  support `String.Format()`-style formatting instructions (such as `{first,15}` for left space-padding to 15 characters, in your example).\r\n\r\nMaking this ability part of regular PowerShell string interpolation is what #12259 proposes.\r\n",
