My understanding is that runspaces (and threads) are spun up as needed unless the throttle limit is hit, and if a runspace completes the task it can be reused. So as long as an individual task being run can complete before the full 100 threads/runspaces are created, it will attempt to reuse the runspaces/threads of previously completed tasks.",

For the output, when the invoked runspace outputs an object, the configured event on `_outputCollection` is called, and it just calls `WriteObject`, which is more or less equivalent to the cmdlet doing some CPU-intensive computation and periodically outputing results (it doesn't matter if the computation is running a PowerShell script or something else).\r\n\r\nI think the issue here is that the the runspace reads the passed `_inputCollection` by waiting on a synchronization object, and thus blocking the whole thread, instead of adding an event handler for new input, handling the input (by calling `ProcessRecord` in the first cmdlet in a pipeline) and giving control back to the event loop. This makes sense as a design choice for the top-level runspace, where blocking while waiting for user input is a natural choice, but breaks down for a nested runspace.\r\n\r\nAnother (related) view is that it a runspace is structurally quite similar to a cmdlet â€“ it is instantiated, reads inputs, creates output and then ends. Cmdlets run in the same thread and it works as expected, so I'd assume that it should be possible to have a runspace work the same.",

Runspaces were created in part to support concurrency, and it doesn't make sense to use it this way.  The `PSThreadOptions.UseCurrentThread` is generally used for nested calls.  Runspaces don't have thread affinity, but scriptblocks running in a runspace do.  If you want to create a cmdlet wrapper that wraps existing cmdlets and passes pipeline input, then you should look at PowerShell proxy commands and the steppable pipeline API.\r\n\r\nRegarding the other question about `ForEach-Object -Parallel`, yes the `ThrottleLimit` does limit the number of runspaces and threads running at a time.  Pipeline input waiting to run in the script block is blocked until a runspace is available.  By default runspaces are reused, but this can cause problems in some cases (with left over state) and there is an option to always run in a newly created runspace (`-UseNewRunspace`).",

    "body": "Thanks for all the insightful answers.\r\n\r\nTo summarize:\r\n1. `UseCurrentThread` should not be used, unless you're manually creating a new thread just for the runspace.\r\n2. Calling `WriteOutput` from the context of another runspace is not a good idea (but that's basically covered by point 1.).\r\n3. The only thread that can accept pipeline input (`ProcessRecord`) and produce pipeline output (`WriteObject`) is the main thread. Therefore, it is not possible to asynchronously write output while accepting input at the same time, because to write output, the main thread must be executing one of the cmdlet methods, and therefore cannot receive new input.\r\n   - This is an interesting limitation of having a single-threaded shell that never occurred to me before.\r\n   - It is visible even in the built-in `ForEach-Object -Parallel` cmdlet, which only writes pipeline output as a result of receiving input, or after all iterations are finished (e.g. `& {0.5; 1; 1.5; sleep 1; 2} | % -Parallel {$_}`).",
