    "body": "In my experience in both Windows and Linux environments, even when you can determine the permissions form the path, you still do not know if you have those permissions until you perform an operation on that path. Maybe there is a .NET Core API that does give reliable results that could be used. \r\n\r\nTo me, the purpose of `Test-Path` is strictly path existence. I'm not sure extending it to include permissions checks is the correct direction. Perhaps a separate cmdlet? It seems permissions would be pretty tricky given `Test-Path` is PSProvider aware and different providers handle permissions differently. Not that a new cmdlet would have an easier time handling that, but, that the complications could be separated from the pretty reliable `Test-Path` code.",
