This is just 1 cyber security site out of thousands that shows it.\r\nhttps://cyberarms.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/bash-bunny-windows-remote-shell-using-metasploit-powershell/\r\n\r\n![picture-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15247713/122673465-916fe700-d19e-11eb-91d4-0ec58e237437.png)\r\n\r\n![picture-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15247713/122673469-96349b00-d19e-11eb-8493-19c50fa821af.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is from from several major windows security problems. \r\n1 - USB port being triggered by USB and activating PowerShell from USB.\r\n     The operating system & PowerShell can not tell the difference between a payload automated typing of text within PowerShell or\r\n     Someone actually physically typing on the keyboard.  Which is why USB-malicious payload can abuse PowerShell.  \r\n2 - Windows doesnt have a proper way of securing account users passwords, its either in plain text or hash which can both be extremely easily broken, as shown in the video by a world known network engineer with CCIE certification. \r\nThere are even tiny programs that are portable apps used for windows, that you double click to trigger, it uses PowerShell to go into registry of the computer, and pull out the account users password.\r\n\r\nIf PowerShell in some way can actually determine when an actual key on a keyboard is physically being pressed by the motion of the actual key itself from pressing down and released from key going back up.  (onPress, onRelease).\r\nMaybe PowerShell devs can figure out a way to negate this, and also prevent USB payloads from acting as a person.\r\n\r\nI dont know I am just trying to open minds so we can live more secure & happier.....  thats all  🤷‍♀️😉\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://cyberarms.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/picture-6.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://secure.gravatar.com/blavatar/2526283909cc72f430c00ff1195346a1?s=32\" height=\"14\"> CYBER ARMS - Computer Security</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://cyberarms.wordpress.com/2017/03/27/bash-bunny-windows-remote-shell-using-metasploit-powershell/\">Bash Bunny: Windows Remote Shell using Metasploit & PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>In this article, we will see how to use the Bash Bunny to get a full reverse shell on a Windows system using Kali Linux, PowerShell and the Metasploit Web Delivery module.

    "body": "I agree with @vexx32.  These are mostly OS issues you'd have if you were using another shell on Windows e.g. CMD or cygwin bash.  Consider using the Windows Feedback tool to raise these issues on Windows security.\r\n\r\nPowerShell does provide some security \"speed bumps\" such as:\r\n\r\n* Script signing support (requires execution policy AllSigned or RemoteSigned)\r\n* PS will not execute from the current dir unless the user specifies the current dir e.g.:  .\\foo.ps1 instead of foo.ps1\r\n* PS does not define an \"Open\" verb to prevent users from getting into trouble by double-clicking .ps1 email attachments.  This avoids I LOVE YOU.vbs virus type issues.\r\n* JEA remoting endpoints - this is for using a remote server but it limits what commands users have access to on the remote server.\r\n\r\nAlso, you can disable PSRemoting if that is a concern.\r\n",
