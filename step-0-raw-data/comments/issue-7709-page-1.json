Also tried -UserName with just the account name as opposed to Domain\\Account - same result.\r\n\r\nOne thing that did actually change behavior though (but did not ultimately solve the problem), was adding a REG_SZ String Value for `DefaultShell` with value `\"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\pwsh.exe\"` to `HKLM:\\Software\\OpenSSH\\`.  (Note that, it didn't exist before). Adding this registry value (and subsequently restarting the sshd service) made the `New-PSSession` cmdlet prompt me for a password (which it shouldn't do because I'm using -KeyFilePath...but at least something happened). Unfortunately, authentication never succeeded eventhough the password for the Domain Admin account was correct and password auth is allowed in the sshd_config. Adding this registry value also caused the aforementioned ssh commands to prompt me for a password (which, again, shouldn't happen because I'm trying to do Public Cert Authentication) with the same result (i.e. authentication was never successful eventhough the password was correct).\r\n\r\nRemoving this registry value and restarting the sshd service got me back to the state mentioned in my original post - i.e. Public Cert Authentication works with ssh.exe, but does not work with the `*-PSSession` cmdlets.\r\n\r\nStill pretty stumped on this...\r\n\r\nBut after googling around for awhile, I've gotta just ask this general question:\r\n\r\nHas **anyone** gotten Public Certificate Authentication to work between two **Windows OSes** using pwsh.exe `*-PSSession` cmdlets?

Instead, logs indicate that sshd was...\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarting session: shell on windows-pty for zero\\\\zeroadmin from 192.168.2.13 port 50944 id 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and then immediately running the `ForceCommand` to put me in pwsh.exe. To clarify, what I **should** be seeing here is...\r\n\r\n```\r\nStarting session: subsystem 'powershell' for zero\\\\zeroadmin from 192.168.2.13 port 51060 id 0\r\n```\r\n\r\n...which is what I see when I run `New-PSSession`. (My updated sshd_config comments-out the `ForceCommand` option : https://gist.github.com/pldmgg/2850f834889fc430c08e3fd4e735c3e3)\r\n\r\nUnfortunately commenting out `ForceCommand` did not make it so that my ssh commands used `Starting session: subsystem...` - they were/are still showing `Starting session: shell`, and I did NOT end up in pwsh.exe (but Public Certificate Authentication worked).\r\n\r\nSo the first problem is figuring out why Subsystem is NOT being used with straight ssh commands, and it IS being used (and failing for some unknown reason) by the pwsh.exe `*-PSSession` cmdlets.\r\n\r\nUpdated sshd logs can be found here:\r\n\r\n1) SSHD_Results_New-PSSession_No_DefaultShell_In_Registry: https://gist.github.com/pldmgg/6cf1a2e1ca02ae540062222fc50bbb63\r\n\r\n2) SSHD_Results_SSHExe_No_DefaultShell_In_Registry:\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/pldmgg/3fa040a73ce6f83385dbc05acb96cf1a",

    "body": "Adding more info from thread on Win32-OpenSSH: https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues/1244\r\n\r\nRight now, my requirement is to use Public Cert Auth and Subsystem sshd_config such that both ssh.exe and Enter-PSSession put me in a pwsh session on the remote host.\r\n\r\nSo far, I have not been able to accomplish this for both ssh.exe and `*-PSSession` cmdlets. The only scenarios that led to me being in a pwsh.exe session on a remote host (where both client and server machines are Windows OSes) are as follows:\r\n\r\nSCENARIO 1: \r\nWithout `DefaultShell` entry in the registry, with `ForceCommand pwsh.exe -NoProfile`  in sshd_config, with `Subsystem powershell C:/symlinks/pwsh.exe -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile` in sshd_config.\r\n\r\n- The ssh commands in my original post place me in a pwsh.exe on the Remote Host (SUCCESS)\r\n- `*-PSSession` cmdlets on the client side fail for some unknown reason (FAILURE)\r\n- NOTE: Eventhough `Subsystem...` is active in sshd_config, it is not honored when using ssh.exe. It is honored when using the `*-PSSession` cmdlets.\r\n- IMPORTANT NOTE: I've just confirmed that using `ForceCommand pwsh.exe -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile` as you suggested causes ssh.exe to hang on the client side - so `ForceCommand pwsh.exe -NoProfile` is the only thing that works for me in this scenario, and only with ssh.exe commands (`*-PSSession` cmdlets still fail in the same way)\r\n\r\nSCENARIO 2:\r\nWith `DefaultShell` entry in the registry of `C:/Program Files/Powershell/6-preview/pwsh.exe` without `ForceCommand` in sshd_config, with `Subsystem powershell C:/symlinks/pwsh.exe -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile` in sshd_config.`\r\n\r\n- The ssh commands in my original post place me in a pwsh.exe on the Remote Host (SUCCESS)\r\n- `*-PSSession` cmdlets on the client side fail for some unknown reason (FAILURE)\r\n- NOTE: Eventhough `Subsystem...` is active in sshd_config, it is not honored when using ssh.exe. It is honored when using the `*-PSSession` cmdlets.\r\n\r\n***For every other permutation of these three configuration settings (`DefaultShell`, `ForceCommand`, `Subsystem`) :***\r\n\r\n- Attempting to connect interactively via the ssh commands outlined in my original post have either -\r\n1) Placed me in cmd.exe on the remote host\r\n2) Prevented me from connecting altogether\r\n3) Hung indefinitely\r\n\r\n- Attempting to connect via the `*-PSSession` cmdlets has never been successful under any circumstances",
