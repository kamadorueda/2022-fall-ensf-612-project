    "body": "This is a good idea, but I think it can be done outside of PowerShell as a module. Basically, you override the default view for `Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.MemberDefinition` when the module is being loaded, and restore the original view when module is unloaded.\r\n\r\nHere is an example module to show how to override the default view of `Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.MemberDefinition`: [TestModule.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/5882767/TestModule.zip)\r\n\r\nIt calls `Update-FormatData -PrependPath` to prepend the new view definition to the original views. Also, since the `test.ps1xml` formating file is decalred in `FormatsToProcess` in the module manifest, view definitions in `test.ps1xml` will be removed when the module is being unloaded.\r\n\r\nIn the example, I add a the column `TypeName` to the new table view. Here is how it works:\r\n```none\r\nPS:5> [System.IO.Path] | gm -Static -Name Join\r\n\r\n   TypeName: System.IO.Path\r\n\r\nName MemberType Definition\r\n---- ---------- ----------\r\nJoin Method     static string Join(System.ReadOnlySpan[char] path1, System.ReadOnlySpan[char] path2), static string Join(System.ReadOnlySpan[char] p…\r\n\r\nPS:6> Import-Module .\\TestModule\r\nPS:7> [System.IO.Path] | gm -Static -Name Join\r\n\r\n   TypeName: System.IO.Path\r\n\r\nTypeName       Name MemberType Definition\r\n--------       ---- ---------- ----------\r\nSystem.IO.Path Join Method     static string Join(System.ReadOnlySpan[char] path1, System.ReadOnlySpan[char] path2), static string Join(System.ReadO…\r\n\r\nPS:8> Remove-Module TestModule\r\nPS:9> [System.IO.Path] | gm -Static -Name Join\r\n\r\n   TypeName: System.IO.Path\r\n\r\nName MemberType Definition\r\n---- ---------- ----------\r\nJoin Method     static string Join(System.ReadOnlySpan[char] path1, System.ReadOnlySpan[char] path2), static string Join(System.ReadOnlySpan[char] p…\r\n\r\nPS:10>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can optionally leverage the `$PSStyle` variable enabled in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13758. But that would make your module require 7.2+ version of PowerShell to work.\r\n\r\n",

It can move way faster to validate different designs/ideas. For example, if you would have a module for this, it may be more generic than just the view definitions for `MemberDefinition`, and you may also want to consider how to make it configurable so different color can be used for different elements in formatting.",

It's been used to create formatting for dozens of modules, including ones built by Microsoft (SCOM 2012, TTK).  Also, as EZOut is a built tool and not something packaged with a module, it's influence outstrips it's individual downloads.  To be 100% clear here I am not suggesting a merge of the tool into PowerShell, just a formatter. \r\n\r\nAdditionally,  I'm not suggesting taking _exactly_ this formatter.

And have confirmed that this works as intended (at least on 7+)?\r\n\r\nI expect it to work, and it works fine in the provided example. If you run into any problems, please open new issues so we can investigate.\r\n\r\n> To be 100% clear here I am not suggesting a merge of the tool into PowerShell, just a formatter.\r\n\r\nUnderstood. I was talking about the formatters only. What you're proposing here is not a tool to generate formating file, but new views.\r\n\r\n> Additionally, I'm not suggesting taking exactly this formatter.\r\n\r\nRight, that's exactly why having it done as a separate module would be benificial -- ideas and designs can be experimented/validated way faster than having it done in PowerShell itself.\r\n\r\n> If this is the intent, it seems that this issue should remain open long enough to collect feedback from others.\r\n\r\nI'm totally fine keeping this issue open.
