And invoking the literal text is bad/unsafe. \r\n\r\nEven limited invoke-expression where only $ expressions in the string are evaluated still gives a file a chance to contain  `\"$(Invoke-Evil)\"`  so the hygiene rule says the code reading the string must specify what goes into placeholders.    \r\n\r\nAnd so one comes back round to saying today   `'{0} likes the colour {1}'` is using array indices and later  `$str -f '@(Molly','red')`  doesn't link nicely.    If also gets nasty when the code evolves. `'{0} {2} likes the colour {1}'`  / `$str -f '@(Molly','red','really')` feels wrong. But if we don't want switch parameters round everywhere we can't change the meaning. \r\nA hash table would be nicer. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

With that said, it probably introduces an opportunity for us to break something or otherwise clobber an underlying .NET functionality, which I think PowerShell has done somewhat badly in the past.\r\n\r\n> `{placeholder}` already comes unstuck if you are trying to insert things into, say, JSON text\r\n\r\nYeah, any templating scheme is going to have some kind of input that collides with its syntax, which is why it must have an escaping mechanism. The nice thing about the existing `-f` positional template syntax is that it already covers both the template syntax and how to escape it, so it's only one extra step to introduce naming, rather than teaching people a new operator and possibly a new syntax/mini-language underneath it.",

The more I turn this over the more I think I was wrong - off the top of my head I can't think of two operators which do the same operation but on different types which is what this would be (`string -f array` . `string -g hashtable` ) . It would be better done in .NET and then the question doesn't arise. \r\n\r\nis the doubling of {} documented ? For more than a decade I've written those as \"[[ should be braced ]]\" and then replaced [[ and ]] with { and  } afterwards.

Note that @BrucePay even favors the name `Expand-Template` over `Expand-String`.\r\n\r\nHowever, as my previous comment hopefully made clear: _both_ approaches are valuable and worth implementing.\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks, @jhoneill - that is indeed why `Expand-String` would be useful: it works when you're _given_ a string (template) _from the outside_ - such as having read it from a file - which is therefore impossible to express as an expandable string _literal_ - I've clarified the OP of #11693 accordingly.\r\n\r\n@SeeminglyScience:\r\n\r\n> It's unlikely that multiple proposals for string templating will be accepted and imo that's a good thing\r\n\r\nBy that logic you should oppose that PowerShell supports both expandable strings and the `-f` operator - two features that ultimately do the same thing. The two approaches we're discussing here are _natural extensions_ to both.\r\n\r\n> Anything security sensitive like arbitrary code execution would likely take same time to verify that it's secure\r\n\r\nI don't think so:\r\nIf the processing is AST-based, it should be easy to rule out non-variables or to limit command use to a predefined safe subset, as @rkeithhill [suggests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11693#issuecomment-616214594).\r\n\r\nFor someone who wants to roll their own, variables-only stopgap version (just to show a simplistic, but effective approach to ruling out commands):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Expand-String {\r\n  param(\r\n    [Parameter(Mandatory, ValueFromPipeline)] [string] $Template\r\n  )\r\n  process {\r\n    $sanitized = $Template -replace '\\$\\(', \"`0\"\r\n    $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.ExpandString($sanitized) -replace \"`0\", '$$('\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n'$HOME is where the heart is. $(Write-Host \"Oh noes!\")' | Expand-String\r\n# -> '/Users/jdoe is where the heart is. $(Write-Host \"Oh noes!\")'\r\n```\r\n\r\n> arbitrary bits of state like variables as template parameters isn't good UX.\r\n\r\nWith _both_ approaches there's a tight coupling between the template placeholder and the calling code that instantiates it, and it's actually tighter in the `-f` case - and whether that's preferable depends on the use case.\r\n\r\nIt's a tradeoff between being the convenience between direct use of elements of the caller's state you can rely on - e.g., automatic variables such as `$HOME` in an `Expand-String` call - and having to always explicitly pass _all_ replacement values in an `-f` expression.\r\n\r\nWith _both_ approaches you can make the operation fail if a bit of caller state is missing / if a replacement value isn't passed (analogous to ` '{0}{1}' -f 'one'` failing).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Text is easier than numbers for both parties. \r\n\r\nWhen you see this away from the template, you need to go somewhere else to see what it means.      \r\n`$template -f  $datarow.colx ,  $datarow.coly ,  $datarow.colz` \r\n \r\nbut this tells you where each is going into the template   \r\n `$template -f  @{to=$datarow.colx ; place=  $datarow.coly ; discount= $datarow.colz` \r\n\r\nAs a general principle supporting parameters-by-name is good, and only allowing parameters-by-position not-so good from a UX point of view.   \r\n",
