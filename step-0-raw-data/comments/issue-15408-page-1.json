Since 5.1 will still be used quite a bit for a long time, AND we expect users of 5.1 have already worked out workarounds needed that they would expect to continue to work in 7.2, reverting to legacy when using `Windows` and the allow list (cmd, js, etc...) would be the most compatible.\r\n\r\nNote that because the modes are an enum, we could potentially have a `Custom` mode in the future where some configuration defines how to escape \"non-standard\" Windows executables so that the user doesn't have to know about them, but would probably break in other scenarios if too much \"magic\" happens.",

(Believe me, this isn't about promoting _my_ module's function; it just so happens to be the least painful solution that I know of; in an ideal world there would never have been a need for such a function.)\r\n\r\nLet's be clear that the proposed `Windows` mode will still break a good deal of existing code based on legacy workarounds, namely all calls to executables / interpreters _not_ in the table of exceptions, such as Node.js, for instance.\r\n\r\nIn `Windows` mode, having to reason with respect to a given call whether the legacy or the new behavior applies only complicates matters - the example I've given before is the `az` CLI, which just so happens to be implemented as `az.cmd`, i.e. as  a _batch file_. But that is an _implementation detail_ that no user should have to pay attention to or should even need to be aware of.\r\n",

    "body": "To flesh out my previous concern:\r\n\r\nMy _guess_ is that many existing workarounds on Windows  do _not_ relate to the executables in the fallback-to-legacy tables, and such workarounds will simply break with `Windows` in effect; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# *Workaround* that works up to v7.1, but breaks with a `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` value\r\n#  other than 'Legacy'.\r\ncurl.exe https://httpbin.org/post -d '{ \\\"foo\\\": \\\"bar\\\" }' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'\r\n\r\n# Ditto.\r\nnode -e 'console.log(\\\"hi\\\")'\r\n``` \r\n\r\nAnd, of course, with `Standard` as the default on Unix, _all_ existing workarounds will break there - but the real concern is the confusing blending of correct and broken legacy behavior on Windows in the form of the ill-begotten `Windows` mode, depending on how the target executable happens to be implemented.\r\n\r\nAnd even if you _do_ know what behavior applies on Windows in a given call, that you selectively have to revert to workarounds for _broken_ behavior - even though PowerShell _could_ implement the correct behavior - sounds like a cruel joke.\r\n\r\nAgain: for someone who needs to continue to author code for both editions, sticking with `Legacy` and the known workarounds _consistently_ is by far the simpler solution.\r\n\r\nSomeone who needs to selectively run old code can activate `Legacy` selectively (or reverse the logic: activate `Standard` selectively).\r\n\r\nThat PowerShell lacks lexical scoping for preferences and, conversely, a cross-module mechanism for setting preferences, and therefore makes their selective application challenging is unfortunate, but not specific to the problem at hand.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I think, the only headache-free way out of this mess is via a _distinct call operator or function_ that selects either the legacy or the (consistently) correct behavior: then each call's behavior can easily reasoned about _by itself_, and doesn't depend on possibly hidden state through dynamically scoped preferences.\r\n\r\nOf course, the challenges are (a) what operator sigil or function name to come up with, and (b) the separate operator/function serving as a perennial reminder that the original implementation was broken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
