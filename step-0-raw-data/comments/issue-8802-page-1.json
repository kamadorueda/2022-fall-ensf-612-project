    "body": "@grandmasterv Our goal is to port ALL the cmdlets. \r\nCurrently this is not possible for two reasons. Firstly, not all API are ported in .Net Core. With each subsequent .Net Core release, ported APIs become more and after .Net Core 3 we will get a lot of new ported APIs. This open ways to port other cmdlets. Secondly, some API are missing in Unix systems. Certainly .Net Core team will look for solutions. \r\nThis also explains why PowerShell Core on Windows has fewer cmdlets than Windows PowerShell.\r\nAs for your proposal, it has already been discussed. This will not give benefits to Unix users since these cmdlets do not exist, but it will complicate the lives of Windows users.\r\n\r\nRight solution is to contribute (feel free!) to .Net Core and PowerShell Core to get its full featured. \r\n ",

    "body": "Hello Illya,\r\n\r\nThanks for shining some light on the reason behind the cmdlets existing on one platform and not another. It seems this problem started in .net core. I feel that .net core should also not make an API function available unless it can be used on all supported platforms as it’s touted as a cross-platform library.  Powershell should not be replicating their problem. What I’m getting at is the overall design decision to release for one platform only instead of waiting till all the parts are available to support a release on ALL platforms.  Your correct in that removing the ones that exist now in windows that don’t exist in other platforms would complicate things and the best way to address that gap is to contribute (still a newb here but I’ll work towards it) but no new cmdlets should be released that are single platform only.",
