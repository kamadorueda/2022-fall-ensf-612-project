    "body": "> Currently PowerShell crashes because it tries to invoke the Delegate without a runspace.\r\n\r\nSo the behavior is a little bit more complicated than that, which makes a solution here sort of difficult. Here is the flow:\r\n\r\n1. ScriptBlock is created on Runspace A running on Thread A\r\n2. It's converted to a delegate and passed to `BeginGetContext`\r\n3. The delegate is invoked on Thread B\r\n4. The thread local field `Runspace.DefaultRunspace` is checked to see if Thread B has a runspace associated with it\r\n\ta. If null, throw\r\n\tb. If not null, but not Runspace A, attempt to marshal the invocation *back to Thread A*\r\n\r\n4b makes a fix really difficult here because even if you do spin up a runspace on Thread B, it's still going to try to marshal it back.  That's going to either result in a deadlock or state corruption (#4003). As the user you could strip runspace affinity with `{}.Ast.GetScriptBlock()` and that may be fine, but it may be better to throw then expect folks to know they need to do that.",
