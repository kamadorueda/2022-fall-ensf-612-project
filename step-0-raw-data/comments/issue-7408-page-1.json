I saw only 5 method calls that used new .Net Core 2.1 APIs that are not available in `net472` and for some of them I created adapters using extension methods, the rest (like e.g. Spans) could all be brought back to full .Net via NuGet packages. Not setting the `CORECLR` constant for compilation against full .net requires to either remove some fullclr code or to bring back some fullclr code that is just not compiled at the moment or in the source-depot branch. Compiling with the `CORECLR` could be possible as well as far as I have seen.\r\nI do not expect full support from MSFT for an SMA package compiled against net472, but having it in the mainstream branch and it being published by MSFT would be helpful.\r\nSince compilation against netstandard is not trivial and and `netstandard2.1` is not even out yet, I'd agree with @SteveL-MSFT that multi-targeting for `net472` (with the coreclr or fullclr option?) is the easiest option where I can issue a PR *now*\r\nSeparating out the Parser seemed to me to be quite difficult.\r\nCan MSFT please state if it is OK to multi-target SMA for `net472` for the moment and if the `CORECLR` compile constant should be set in this case.\r\ncc @TravisEz13  @SteveL-MSFT ",

I already did a prototype a few months ago and there are actually not too many adaptions that are needed since most of the new features can brought to `net472` via NuGet packages (e.g. Spans), in total there are only around 10 cases where a slightly different API call is needed or an extension method needs to be created to adapt for `net472`. Would you accept such a PR where I just multitarget SMA for `net472` as well but use the PowerShell Core code (i.e. the `CORECLR` will be defined)? Alternatively, separating out the parser into its own project as discussed by @rjmholt  [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1806#issuecomment-439268046) would be a viable alternative (the use case for me would be to be able to get rid of a dependency on WIndows PowerShell in a Desktop WPF app that will never be able to go to .Net Core due to a dependency on Workflow foundation)",

Just moving the [engine/parser](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser) and [engine/lang](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/lang) folders from SMA into a new project that references the same projects/packages as SMA results in more than 200 compilation errors due to missing types in SMA, some of them like `LightCompiler` or `Interpreter` should maybe (?) not be in there and other types in the [engine](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine) folder and it seems quite a bit of refactoring is required...",
