    "body": "Just to spell it out, because the fact that your sample code actually _does_ work confused me:\r\n\r\nThe commands _accumulate_ in the `pwsh.Commands` collection, and subsequent `.Invoke()` calls try to execute them _all_, in addition to accumulating stream output in `pwsh.Streams` across calls, as @SeeminglyScience  points out.\r\n\r\nYour second `.Invoke()` call is therefore roughly equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[powershell]::Create().AddCommand(\"Get-Date\").AddCommand(\"Get-Date\").AddArgument('1970-01-01').Invoke()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich in turn is equivalent to:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Date | Get-Date\r\n```\r\n\r\nand the latter just _happens_ to work, because `Get-Date` also accepts a `[datetime]` instance via the pipeline, so this pipeline is in effect the same as just calling `Get-Date` alone.\r\nAdding a `-Date` argument to the 2nd `GetDate` call would surface the problem, however, because something like `Get-Date | Get-Date 1970-01-01` indeed fails.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for the API surface and your extension method:\r\n\r\nIf the intent is to also clear the _streams_, you cannot include `.Streams.ClearStreams()` in the `.InvokeAndClear()` method, as you would instantly wipe out the `.Invoke()` call's non-success stream output.\r\n\r\nSo I wonder if something along the following lines is called for instead:\r\n\r\nA fluent `.Reset()` method that calls `.Commands.Clear()` and `.Streams.ClearStreams()` and returns the PowerShell instance itself, as the existing methods do.\r\n\r\nThis means that resetting can then either be performed stand-alone:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npwsh.Reset();  // same as: .Commands.Clear(); .Streams.ClearStreams(); return this;\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr, fluently, as part of recurring invocations on a reusable `PowerShell` instance:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npwsh.Reset().AddCommand(\"Get-Date\").Invoke<DateTime?>().FirstOrDefault();\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
