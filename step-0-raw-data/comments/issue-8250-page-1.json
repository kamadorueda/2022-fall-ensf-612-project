    "body": "I'd like to do this for a first contribution. \r\n\r\nMy initial thought is that I'd expect `-Persist` to work on Nano Server and IoT Core. Therefore, throwing on `Persist && !Platform.IsWindows` would be the right condition. I'll try to verify that, just in case `Platform.IsWindowsDesktop` is actually the better choice. \r\n\r\n`NewPSDriveCommand.ProcessRecord` throws if `Persist` is used with a provider other than `FileSystem`. This seems like the perfect location to also check that `Persist` is not used outside of Windows.  ",
