    "body": "Well there's always the possibility of starting PowerShell with an invalid config file. So we have to handle it and the question becomes how. I see a couple of possibilities:\r\n1. Crash PowerShell with a stack trace like now\r\n1. Shut PowerShell down immediately and display an error message that the config file is invalid\r\n1. Attempt to partially load the config file, skirting around the invalid part\r\n1. Start PowerShell as if no config file were provided\r\n\r\nIn (1) and (2), the problem is that if PowerShell is the only shell you can use, you've now locked yourself out -- there's nothing you can do, because PowerShell can't be started. It's likely you have another shell or a way to delete the file on the machine, or if you're lucky someone else administers your box. But we have to support all scenarios, and having to fall back to another shell in any case doesn't seem like what we want to tell users.\r\n\r\nThat leaves (3) and (4), and to me (3) would be like finding a parse error in a PowerShell script and executing until that point anyway -- rather than what we actually do, which is execute nothing and tell the user that there's a problem.\r\n\r\nSo I think the solution is (4). PowerShell starts as if there were no config file and displays an error message with a full explanation, including:\r\n- The config file is invalid\r\n- Why it's invalid\r\n- *Where* it's invalid\r\n- The fact that PowerShell started ignoring it and it needs to be fixed to be loaded",

I agree that the config file should not be used to configure security, and in fact we should ensure that the config file cannot affect session security.  For example PowerShell provides security guarantees in two ways:\r\n\r\n   a. When working with system wide application control such as WDAC (formerly DeviceGuard), e.g., ConstrainedfLanguage mode.\r\n   b. Remote end point sessions, e.g., LanguageMode, command, provider accessibility.\r\n\r\nWe need to make sure the config file cannot affect security stance in these cases, such as changing LanguageMode, or changing visibility of functions, cmdlets, providers, etc.",
