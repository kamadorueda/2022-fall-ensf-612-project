For some reason I think it is less of an issue with `more` than with `less`.  We integrated `less` into PSCX a long time ago and we definitely did get issues/complaints from folks who couldn't figure out how to exit `less`.  Oh yeah, forgot to mention that you can run `less` on Windows.  That's what I do.  Just set `$env:PAGER = 'less'`.  Since that env can supply args now I think you could set it to `$env:PAGER = 'less \"-PPowerShell help line %lt (press h for help or q to quit)\"'`. Of course, you need to grab `less` and stick in your path somewhere.",

    "body": "Indeed, handy stuff.\r\n\r\nmacOS, FreeBSD, and Linux distros (all? verified on Ubuntu) all seem to have the very same GNU implementation of `less`, so my guess is that it works on all supported Unix-like platforms.\r\n\r\nThis despite the fact that `less` is not a POSIX-mandated utility, only [`more`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/more.html) is (which doesn't support prompt customization).\r\n\r\nSmall caveat: on macOS, `more` is `less` in disguise, so the `man` utility effectively uses `less` there, which means that customization of `less` via `$env:LESS` also affects `man` paging.  \r\nEven though on Ubuntu uses `less` by default too, it applies its own prompt-string customization, which overrides `$env:LESS`.\r\n\r\nSmall syntax correction: **it should be `-Ps\"..\"`**, because the first char. after `P` indicates which prompt string is being customized (`s` for short (default), `m` for medium (with the `-m` option), `M` for long (with the `-M` option)).  \r\n\r\nAlso, if multiple options must be preset in `$env:LESS`, the end of the prompt string must be marked with `$`.\r\n\r\n**Updated examples**, which additionally show an example of a _conditional_ token and the need to escape literal `.` as `\\.` (alongside `? % \\ :`):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Note the 's' after '-P' and the need to \\-escape .\r\n# ?B of %D:. is a conditional that shows \"of page <page-count>\", if known, and nothing otherwise.\r\ngps | less '-PsPage %db?B of %D:.\\. Press h for help or q to quit\\.'\r\n\r\n# Note the $ as the string terminator.\r\n$env:LESS = '-PsPage %db?B of %D:.\\. Press h for help or q to quit\\.$'\r\ngps | less\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more on prompt-string syntax, see https://man.cx/less#heading10\r\n\r\n\r\n",
