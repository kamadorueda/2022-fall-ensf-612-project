    "body": "The Last time I tried `VS Code`,  was like half a year ago.\r\nAnd the `language server` was constantly crashing when you\r\nopen 5-10 tabs with custom `PS 5` classes and enums referencing one another, so `IntelliSense` stopped working, and the `IDE` was behaving kind of weird.  I wanted to port, `PowerShellEditorServices` To `IDEA`, but it seemed too much work for one person, so I stuck with `PS Studio`. But as I'm viewing the `PowerShellEditorServices` [changelog](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#090) now, it certainly seems that lot's of the bugs were resolved, and `VS Cod`e become more mature and stable, so I'll give it another shot. And Thank you guys for the product, you are doing a great job, advocating PowerShell! 👍 :1st_place_medal: ",

(In my mind, even if they're caused by the underlying console hosts, we have so little control over the underlying hosts across platforms that progress functionality is what needs to be refactored or even limited). Also, added #2822. 👍 \r\n\r\nI agree with you on code analysis. Maybe @JamesWTruher or @SteveL-MSFT could spin up an Issue for me to add here? \r\n\r\nI hear you on WSL support, but I think we're prioritizing Linux distros and macOS right now because of the lack of compelling scenarios for using PowerShell from WSL. Furthermore, I think they *eventually* (this is only from public knowledge with *zero* internal knowledge of timelines or how the functionality might work) plan on interoperating with Windows processes, in which case you wouldn't need to run \"PowerShell on Linux\" from within WSL but just \"PowerShell Core 6.0 on Windows\". \r\n\r\nIf you disagree with my statement on \"compelling scenarios\", please let me know. I love to be proven wrong on these sorts of things :) \r\n\r\n@ChristophB125: could you elaborate more on what you mean by \"support Docker\"? We currently have Docker listed as a platform, and we publish a [ton of images to the Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell/) (including [nightlies](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell-nightly), though it looks like we forgot to publish alpha.15, I'm following up). \r\n\r\nIf you mean, do we have a PowerShell module for managing Docker, the Hyper-V team [has already done exactly that](https://github.com/microsoft/docker-powershell). It already supports Windows PowerShell 5.x as well as PowerShell Core 6.0 on Windows, Nano, macOS, and Linux. \r\n\r\nOut of curiosity, who is \"we\"? Would love to talk more about how you're using PowerShell 6.0 :) \r\n\r\n",

I love to be proven wrong on these sorts of things :)\r\n\r\nI agree but there are still \"compelling scenarios\".\r\nMicrosoft announce WSL as \"kill\" [developer feature](https://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2016/07/22/fun-with-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/#42OMwW0pm5sTxUSu.97):\r\n> The WSL was designed and built by the Windows Kernel Team and delivered in partnership with Canonical, to help Windows 10 developers use the rich Linux developer ecosystem and tools alongside the great tools they are already using in Windows, without having to boot into another operating system or VM. This is definitely a “by developers, for developers” Windows 10 feature, specifically designed to remove a bit of friction from developers’ daily workflow.\r\n\r\nAs a Windows user I tried to use the Powershell Core under WSL and failed 😕 \r\nI want:\r\n1. Develop and test powershell scripts\r\n2. Develop and test binary powershell modules\r\n3. Build Powershell Core from sources\r\n4. Develop and debug features of Powershell Core\r\n\r\nI believe that this is fully in line with the Microsoft WSL announcement.\r\nIt would be great to ask Kernel team to help us to get it working.",

    "body": "@joeyaiello Thank you for the answer. Yes, the PowerShell docker images is what I was looking for. This would be great because then PowerShell can get shipped as part of the deployment (we have the fear that our clients are anxious about Microsoft's IP being on their Linux machines therefore docker can help us hide that at least at install time). By the way,, 'we' is just loosely referring to the team in my company that I work for, which I cannot disclose here. Although we are a Microsoft Gold partner the information from the dev team directly is very valuable to us. As GitHub does not allow private messaging any more, I sent you a LinkedIn request instead if you want to find out a bit more about how we use PowerShell.\r\n\r\n@HemantMahawar Thanks for the effort. I am looking forward to join the next call!",

I'm not sure that it goes through any kind of NTLM layer (as I'm not sure SSH support NTLM), but I don't think it should matter from a functional perspective. \r\n\r\nEDIT: Maybe @manojampalam can comment here.

    "body": "I understand a *little* better why this diagram is drawn the way it is when I looked at [the blog for it](https://artofpwn.com/offensive-and-defensive-powershell-i.html), but it's a little misleading. Basic way to think about it is that WSMan is the protocol/standard (short for WS-Management) and WinRM is the implementation of that protocol as a service in Windows. \r\n\r\n@VGerris as @SteveL-MSFT said, what you're talking about *can* technically work, but it's extremely difficult to configure and it requires that your Linux machine is AD domain-joined (which is also difficult to pull off). For those reasons, we don't currently formally support that scenario. \r\n\r\nHowever, WSMan based remoting is not agentless. You still have to run the WinRM service on your Windows machine: that's an agent. In the next release of Windows 10 and Windows Server, OpenSSH itself will be available as a supported feature-on-demand, so you'll have first-party, inbox support for SSH-based remoting as a peer to WSMan-based remoting.
