    "body": "I do not think there are any risksâ€”but I think that the change you request is inconsistent with the concept.  The command operates in several modes and one mode is the default, so the switch to that mode is optional.  However, the decision *which mode is the default* is arbitrary, and while it would be an unwanted breaking change to change it, it is only caused by the inertia of the code base and not by any inherent special property of the default mode that makes it the default.  After this change, any attempt to change the default mode (e.g. in a fork) would involve tweaking the mandatory statuses.  I can see no value in doing this.\r\n* What is wrong with writing that all parameters are optional?  \r\n\r\nI think that the general rule that parameter set leaders should be mandatory is misleading to the users.  Since I, as a user, have a free choice of which parameter set to use, I perceive the corresponding leading switch as **optional**.  The fact that it is **necessary** for the parameter set to be used does not make it **mandatory**.\r\nCompare the usual privacy statement: you are not *compelled* to give us your data, but *unless* you do, you *will not be able* to use our services.

For example, in Pester, it would be fully reasonable if `Should -ErrorId:â€¦` implied `-Throw`.  That would make both parameters `Throw` and `ErrorId` optional, so your solution to this problem is not only logically incorrect but also partial in practice.  It would be better to explicitly mark parameter set triggers rather than make them all mandatory, which, as I have said, you cannot always do.\r\n\r\nIMVHO.\r\n",
