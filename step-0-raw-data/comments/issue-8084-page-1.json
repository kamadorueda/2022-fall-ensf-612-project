    "body": "Hi Andrew,\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nI have replaced the photo, which make the scaling better.\r\nIt’s currently 1920x1080, which is more “square”. And by using the Preview function, I can see it fits the window.\r\nAlso, I went through the ‘using-vscode.md’, and I can confirm that it is still updated and relevant.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nLasse Hastrup\r\n\r\nFra: Andrew <notifications@github.com>\r\nSendt: Monday, October 22, 2018 10:37 PM\r\nTil: PowerShell/PowerShell <PowerShell@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: Lasse Hastrup <l@hastrup.me>; Author <author@noreply.github.com>\r\nEmne: Re: [PowerShell/PowerShell] Added updated photo of VScode due to new version of VScode (#8084)\r\n\r\n\r\n@anmenaga requested changes on this pull request.\r\n\r\nNew photo was taken on a high-res screen, so when auto-scaled to the low-width boundaries of 'using-vscode.md' tutorial it will be unreadable.\r\nFor taking the screenshot please: 1) temporary drop the resolution of the screen 2) make sure that VS code window is relatively square (currently proposed image is twice as wide as it is tall).\r\n\r\nPS. While you are at it, it would be great if you could double-check 'Editing with Visual Studio Code' instructions on 'using-vscode.md'. Are they still accurate on the latest VS Code version? Thanks.\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you authored the thread.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/8084#pullrequestreview-167097643>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/Ap--SN1OLxmrzrw12w85wBSWlME3wRU9ks5uniyIgaJpZM4XwOwb>.\r\n",
