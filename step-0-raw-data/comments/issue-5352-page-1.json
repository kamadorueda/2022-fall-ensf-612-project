    "body": ".NET Core does not support `System.Web.dll` and there are apparently no plans to port it from .NET Framework to .NET Core as it is tightly dependent on IIS and .NET Core's aim is to be cross-platform compatible. Since PowerShell Core is built on .NET Core it wont be possible to use classes from `System.Web.dll` in PowerShell Core. You can search for comparable APIs using the [.NET API browser](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.web?view=netcore-2.0). Many of the API's have been moved to [ASP.NET Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/?view=aspnetcore-2.0). \r\n\r\nit *may* be possible to directly reference the full path of `System.Web.dll` instead of the partial name. But I don't believe `System.Web.dll` is compatible with .NET Core and I haven't tried myself. You can experiment with that, but I believe the better course would be to try and find comparable API's in .NET Core and move your code to them.",

    "body": "Hi guys, I've made the module Powershell Core compatible (since I needed it in Powershell Core myself) and renamed it TUN.CredentialManager.\r\n\r\nI've reimplemented the GeneratePassword method from Microsoft as suggested by @ArmaanMcleod (thanks a lot, that helped!) and I've also experienced the problem that it didn't find the cmdlets if they weren't explicitly exported in the module manifest, which I've done now.\r\n\r\nThe module has a new name ( TUN.CredentialManager ) and new GUID since I cannot upload new versions to Dave's module in the Powershell Gallery. The new version should be backwards compatible to the old Powershell versions as well as compatible to the new Powershell Core. Since it uses the same cmdlet names you'd need to uninstall the old CredentialManager module first and then install the new TUN.CredentialManager module for everything to work properly. But nothing changed for the cmdlet calls, so this new TUN.CredentialManager module is backwards compatible to the old CredentialManager module by Dave, all you may need to change is the name of the module you import (if it wasn't installed). The versioning starts with 2.1 since the old CredentialManager stopped at 2.0. The copyright message was extended with my name and the new year, the license is unchanged (MIT).\r\n\r\nThe new TUN.CredentialManager module can be found here:\r\nhttps://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/TUN.CredentialManager\r\nhttps://github.com/echalone/PowerShell_Credential_Manager\r\n\r\nAnd can simply be installed via...\r\nInstall-Module -Name TUN.CredentialManager\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://powershellgallery.com/Content/Images/Branding/PackageDefaultIcon.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://powershellgallery.com/packages/TUN.CredentialManager/\">TUN.CredentialManager 2.1</a></strong></div><div>Provides access to credentials in the Windows Credential Manager (continuation of CredentialManager by Dave Garnar)</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/badd1a35e58a3d3e8bddf34698b8c9a3fcf2390f6b5c5490f3f6480b184337ee/echalone/PowerShell_Credential_Manager\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/echalone/PowerShell_Credential_Manager\">GitHub - echalone/PowerShell_Credential_Manager: PowerShell Module to Read and Write Credentials from the Windows Credential Manager</a></strong></div><div>PowerShell Module to Read and Write Credentials from the Windows Credential Manager - GitHub - echalone/PowerShell_Credential_Manager: PowerShell Module to Read and Write Credentials from the Windo...</div></blockquote>",
