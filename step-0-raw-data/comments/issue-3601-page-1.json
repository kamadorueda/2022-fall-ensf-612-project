    "body": "Based on the repro, I would say this issue has nothing to do with PowerShell.\r\n\r\nI'm not installing the font, but I have another font (Fira Code) that renders those characters correctly, and I can't repro.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the problem is either the font or conhost. You should try to narrow down where the problem is, e.g. try to repro in cmd (maybe write a C# program to print those characters).\r\n\r\nAlso try changing the font after the characters are on the screen, if selection works as expected with one font, but not your version of Consolas, I might suspect the font.\r\n\r\nIf you narrow it down to conhost, you can report it [here](https://github.com/microsoft/bashonwindows).",
