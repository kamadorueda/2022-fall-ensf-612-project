I should mention that admin installs with Powershell Core doesn't really fix the issue, so this is not relevant. `C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell` is not in the PSModulePath either, but that's where an `AllUsers` scoped install of a module ends up.\n\n> Yeah but logically that is how it should work with the change to the User path in PSModulePath\n\nI'm not sure what this means. Are you saying this change is already checked in somewhere or that you agree it should behave as I mentioned earlier (i.e. either keep ~/Documents/WindowsPowershell in PSModulePath or make PowershellGet install to ~/Documents/Powershell on Powershell Core)?\n\n> especially with the move to SemanticVersioning which has broken a number of things.\n\nThe SemanticVersioning issues have been resolved in the nightlies.\n\nI am aware you can manually import powershell modules from wherever they may exist on disk, but I don't see how this is relevant to fixing the `install-module foo; ipmo foo;` workflow we had in Powershell 5.\n",
