    "body": "I really like the idea of the change, but I believe it will break *a lot* of existing scripts.  Take this function for example.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-Function {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    begin {\r\n        # Arbitrary intialization code\r\n        if (-not (Get-Module ModuleThatMightChangeCodePath)) {\r\n            Write-Warning 'Recommended module was not found'\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    end {\r\n        if ($false) {\r\n            # Conditional error hit, caller can use `ErrorAction` to determine how this is handled.\r\n            Write-Error 'Possible problem!'\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        # Do real work. This won't be hit if Get-Module writes a non-terminating error and\r\n        # ErrorAction is stop\r\n        return $true\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Returns $true if condition is not hit.\r\nTest-Function -ErrorAction Stop\r\n\r\nfunction Get-Module {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param([string] $Name)\r\n    end {\r\n        Write-Error 'Not found'\r\n    }\r\n} \r\n\r\n# Always fails during initialization\r\nTest-Function -ErrorAction Stop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is something I do pretty frequently.  Use a command like `Get-Module` while doing some validation and then continue on with the rest of the command.  Now since the error `Get-Module` would throw is non terminating, alone it doesn't really affect anything.  But if I use this function in a script, and I expect to be able to force that *expected* error to be terminating, that function breaks unexpectedly.\r\n\r\nI suspect this is a pretty common pattern, and the discussed change would significantly hurt script portability if it was made across the board.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "In the community call, it was mentioned that there really should be `Test-Module` function to do it. The problem is the breaking change.\r\n\r\nI think we should take a step back from these types of changes and focus on a deprecation process to manage breaking changes. Upgrading versions should require minimal changes to existing code to make it easy to update to incremental releases and have warnings and error messages to help a scripter update their code. \r\n\r\nFor example, this fix could have a warning to migrate to a new `Test-Module` cmdlet if trying to test for a condition.

Agree that this is a bucket 3 risk and don't expect users to leverage this cmdlet in automation, so we are ok with accepting this change.",
