    "body": "@mattleibow nope. Let me go back a little ways in my commit history for the file I was using here...\r\n\r\n[This](https://github.com/Jaykul/PortableNativeBinariesTest/blob/master/PortableModule.psm1) was the original from @jaykul (linked by @SeeminglyScience above). Ah! Patrick, I was using that script under the assumption that Skia's own DLLImport methods most likely would handle the native import, especially since placing the native runtime files in the same folder as the SkiaSharp.dll allowed it to load flawlessly.\r\n\r\nI noted that the error message on Mac systems (@TylerLeonhardt _may_ still have a copy of the exact error or can get it for us; he was helping me test it on Mac) seems to point to a different library path than Joel had noted in his script, and so I ended up with this script where I added the paths to _both_ variables:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vexx32/PSWordCloud/blob/d01d38c7b837639c5070edee07a44b3d92e10571/Cmdlet/PSWordCloud.psm1\r\n\r\nSetting the library paths didn't work at all, although moving the .dylib file to the same folder as SkiaSharp.dll _did_. The library paths don't seem to be respected in all cases, despite being directly referenced in the error messages. I haven't yet attempted changing the recorded environment variables outside the PowerShell process to accomplish this, but it may be necessary to have that work, I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nCurrently I'm working around this as you can see [here](https://github.com/vexx32/PSWordCloud/blob/Cmdlet/Module/PSWordCloud.psm1) (module file) and [here](https://github.com/vexx32/PSWordCloud/blob/Cmdlet/build.ps1) build file. Basically I execute the build script to compile the DLLs and copy them from the output folder into a subtree that ends up looking like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPSWordCloud/\r\n  |- win-x64/\r\n    |- SkiaSharp.dll\r\n    |- libSkiaSharp.dll\r\n  |- win-x86/\r\n    |- SkiaSharp.dll\r\n    |- libSkiaSharp.dll\r\n  |- linux-x64/\r\n    |- SkiaSharp.dll\r\n    |- libSkiaSharp.so\r\n  |- osx/\r\n    |- SkiaSharp.dll\r\n    |- libSkiaSharp.dylib\r\n  |- PSWordCloudCmdlet.dll\r\n  |- PSWordCloud.psd1\r\n  |- PSWordCloud.psm1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there will be a good bit of duplicating the main SkiaSharp.dll, but this way I can selectively pick which folder to `Add-Type` the file from when importing the PowerShell module on a given platform.\r\n\r\nThe duplication is necessary, since I am unable to `Add-Type` the `libSkiaSharp.*` files directly; on Windows they give me `Bad IL format` errors, and I imagine a similar error on other OSes as well, though I haven't had a chance to try that and don't really consider it necessary.\r\n\r\nThus far I have tested Mac and Windows, and the library paths have only been respected on Windows (probably because they're literally just pulled from `%PATH%` and used as-is).",

But, you don't have to worry about it as the managed SkiaSharp.dll will load it automatically via P/Invoke.\r\n\r\nThe real issue here is that you are publishing a .NET Core app, and everything is in the right place. The native files are supposed to be under the runtimes folder. PowerShell is just not respecting those rules. If you were to compile and publish a .NET Core console or web app, the .NET Core runtime would know to look in those folders.\r\n\r\nThat is why I would rather fix this on the PowerShell side as they need to correctly look at the runtimes folder.\r\n\r\nIf you have a look at this file: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/building/internals.md#native-components you can see PowerShell itself uses this folder structure, it just appears to no understand it with modules.",

    "body": "People *keep* asking for PowerShell to do this: #3091 #6642 #6724\r\n\r\nWe can't keep pushing this stuff off on module authors -- not only is it painful, it also produces a lot of copies of everything. We also can't put it purely on PowerShellGet, unless we _really_ think the right solution is to build NPM-like warrens of dependencies inside every module folder.\r\n\r\nHowever, if we do think that's the right solution, we should at least do it the way NPM does: the package manager needs to support _assemblies_ as dependencies -- not require us to re-package them in modules.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think the NPM way is wrong, and the `dotnet` build way is a better model: a single copy of the assemblies which your session can go fetch from a central location when it's needed.\r\n\r\nThis means **PowerShell** needs to do the heavy lifting #7259\r\n\r\nWe would add nuget package references to `RequiredAssemblies`, and \r\n\r\n1. PowerShellGet would download those dependencies \r\n2. PowerShell would go find them and load the right one",
