    "body": "> provided by another team, has a hard coded path to load the libraries from.\r\n\r\nThat's not true, the \"universal\" Linux build they have provided you are linked to the following OpenSSL libs\r\n\r\n* `libssl.so.1.0.0`\r\n* `libcrypto.so.1.0.0`\r\n\r\nThese are not absolute paths but library names that the loader checks in the various library paths on the host. You can see that in the following snippet, note I don't have OpenSSL 1.0.x installed and deleted the symlinks to show you what actual linked name so `not found` is expected.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@713b4cbcd41d /]# ldd /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/libmi.so\r\nldd: warning: you do not have execution permission for `/opt/microsoft/powershell/7/libmi.so'\r\n        linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffeb393a000)\r\n        libpthread.so.0 => /lib64/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007fb157362000)\r\n        libdl.so.2 => /lib64/libdl.so.2 (0x00007fb15715e000)\r\n        libpam.so.0 => /lib64/libpam.so.0 (0x00007fb156f4e000)\r\n        libssl.so.1.0.0 => not found\r\n        libcrypto.so.1.0.0 => not found\r\n        libc.so.6 => /lib64/libc.so.6 (0x00007fb156b8b000)\r\n        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007fb157582000)\r\n        libaudit.so.1 => /lib64/libaudit.so.1 (0x00007fb156961000)\r\n        libcap-ng.so.0 => /lib64/libcap-ng.so.0 (0x00007fb15675b000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTypically these libraries are just picked up in the normal load path like `/usr/lib`, or the one specified by `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. The `libmi.so` binary also has an RPATH set to `$ORIGIN` which allows it to also check the origin path (same dir it is placed in) which is what allows you to use the symlinks\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@2cd102a3a066 /]# objdump -x /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/libmi.so | grep RPATH\r\n  RPATH                $ORIGIN\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut with the exception of EL7, which I go into below, you don't need the symlinks at all as `lib[crypto|ssl].so.1.0.0` is in the normal system paths for distributions that ship with OpenSSL 1.0.x. On Ubuntu 16.04 I deleted the symlinks and you can see that it picked up the system locations just fine.\r\n\r\n```\r\nroot@9d42597878f5:/# ldd /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/libmi.so\r\n        linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffc80db9000)\r\n        libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f0741cf0000)\r\n        libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f0741aec000)\r\n        libpam.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpam.so.0 (0x00007f07418de000)\r\n        libssl.so.1.0.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f0741676000)\r\n        libcrypto.so.1.0.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0 (0x00007f0741231000)\r\n        libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f0740e67000)\r\n        /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f0741f0d000)\r\n        libaudit.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libaudit.so.1 (0x00007f0740c40000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a normal situation you should just be picking up these libraries as they are installed, this actually works just fine if you have OpenSSL 1.0.x installed with only 2 caveats\r\n\r\n* Enterprise Linux 7 (CentOS 7, RHEL 7, etc) uses `.10` as the suffix for the OpenSSL libs in `/usr/lib64` so they won't be picked up\r\n  * This is one case where you probably need the symlinks or to patch the ELF headers to point to the distro specific path for that distribution only\r\n  * Other distributions that still package OpenSSL 1.0.x use the `lib[ssl|crypto].so.1.0.0` file so they just work\r\n* macOS does have a hardcoded path to `/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/lib[ssl|crypto].1.0.0.dylib`\r\n  * This is a different distribution package and IIRC it doesn't contain symlinks so I consider it a separate problem\r\n\r\nThe other issue is that the PowerShell package for newer distributions have a symlink to point `lib[ssl|crypto].1.0.0` to the OpenSSL 1.1.x paths which is completely wrong. This causes a seg fault in the process when `libmi` tries to use any OpenSSL APIs.\r\n\r\nSo ultimately what I think should happen is\r\n\r\n* Patch the `libmi.so` library to change the suffix of libssl and libcrypto to `.10` for the RPM/Enterprise Linux package\r\n* Do nothing, no symlinks on the other Linux distributions\r\n\r\nI also think you should be consuming the newer releases from the [omi repo](https://github.com/microsoft/omi/releases) where that team has actually provided an official \"universal\" OpenSSL 1.1.x build which you can use on newer distributions that don't ship OpenSSL 1.0.x (read mostly all of them). It also means that patched `libmi.so` library is only shipped on EL7, everything else shouldn't require symlinks.\r\n\r\nmacOS is another problem and there's not much you can do there without recompling your own version of `omi` on OpenSSL 1.1.x which is understandable why you don't want to do.",

The package has symlinks which is not needed all the time (only EL7). The package symlinks point to OpenSSL 1.1.x which causes seg faults in PowerShell whenever you try to use any of the TLS components in libmi. How is that not related to the packaging components and thus this PR.\r\n\r\nthere are comments asking why things are done the way they are, I’m explaining the problem and why the existing packaging setup is wrong and giving possible fixes for it. I can’t really raise the PR myself because there are a lot of internal moving parts in the packaging process so my comments are a way of trying to stress what is wrong and hopefully illustrate what could be done to solve it.",
