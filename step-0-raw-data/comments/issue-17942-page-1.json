What I don't think works is that it loads \r\n\r\nHaving just tested this  in 7.2.6 with a Test Module requiring PowerShell 8.0 as a minimum in the System path and one in the user path that doesn't specify a version, with user path first the working module will load, however if you switch the ordering and puth user path at the end of PSModulePath and run `Get-Command TestMod -Refresh -All -ListAvailable` to rebuild the Module Analysis Cache, then Get-Command will show the following and any attempt to load doesn't load the module or the one that should work that is in the user path\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6355225/188202241-6d130153-f069-4f93-b9f0-c0353faa73d0.png)\r\n\r\nAlso in testing this on 7.3.0-preview7 when both versions are in the User module path it won't auto load the version that will work if there is a version that won't in the same path\r\nI also get the same behaviour in v5.1 too on Windows 11t\r\n\r\nSo whilst it definitely would be nice for the next version possible to load, i.e. the one that is actually compatible with the current PowerShell environment, whether that be version or required dependencies etc, I 'd like it if there was also a switch that can be used to opt out of next version loading if the most recent version is not loadable. \r\nI think the issue really becomes `How do we ensure we are loading the right module if not in the same path?` as shown in the above screen shot that it doesn't work in the same path right now, and does in different ones either, though that's manageable if we also compare a set of properties in the module manifest which isn't always properly populated so may not be fully reliable but would be a viable way to do this.",
