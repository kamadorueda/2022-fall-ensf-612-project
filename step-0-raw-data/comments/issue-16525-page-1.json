    "body": "It might be good to share your `csproj` file to see how you are referencing the PowerShell library in your dotnet application. What it looks like is you might be including the pwsh library but none of the extras that `pwsh` actually ships with which includes the assembly where the CIM cmdlets are implemented. In this case `pwsh` will automatically import the CIM cmdlets from the Windows PowerShell install through a PSRemoting setup on localhost which is why each individual command creates a deserialized instance.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly used as a backwards compatibility implementation for older cmdlets that haven't been updated to support .NET Core 3+ but in your case I think it's pulling in the older version that is included with Windows PowerShell rather than the ones shipped by PowerShell 7. To test this theory out I would run the following and provide back what it outputs:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module CimCmdlets -PassThru | Select-Object Name, ModuleType, Path\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a working case you should see the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nName       ModuleType Path\r\n----       ---------- ----\r\nCimCmdlets     Binary C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimCmdlets.dll\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn a broken case either the `Path` or `ModuleType` might be different meaning it's not picking up the actual `pwsh` shipped binary.",

So when testing the output of `dotnet publish` vs the `dotnet publish` with the extra arguments I found that the dll no longer exists in the expected directory\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/143946472-06f037e1-94e5-4672-b3ef-4d6ffbf3f8b6.png)\r\n\r\nThe left is just `dotnet publish` whereas the right is the publish step with your extra arguments. You can see that it no longer contains `Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimCmdlets.dll` and thus it will fallback to `CimCmdlets` through Windows PowerShell through the implicit remoting session. This is why the CimSession options you get back is a serialized object and thus won't work with `New-CimSession`. Just to 100% verify this I can see the following when adding the following to the script being run\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[Console]::WriteLine((Get-Module -Name CimCmdlets | Select Name, ModuleType, Path | Out-String))\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n# With your extra publish arguments\r\n# Notice how this is a Script and is a \"proxy\" module\r\nName       ModuleType Path\r\n----       ---------- ----\r\nCimCmdlets     Script C:\\Users\\vagrant-domain\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\2\\remoteIpMoProxy_CimCmdlets_1.0.0.0_localhost_b61e21e.\r\n\r\n# Just dotnet publish by itself\r\n# This is a binary module pointing towards the dll as expected\r\nName       ModuleType Path\r\n----       ---------- ----\r\nCimCmdlets     Binary C:\\temp\\test\\bin\\Debug\\net5.0\\runtimes\\win\\lib\\net5.0\\Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimCmdl.\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately at this point it's a bit beyond my understanding of how all this is meant to be done with `dotnet publish` but there certainly is a problem with your built artifact not containing the required assemblies. It might just need some extra tweaks to the `.csproj` but someone more knowledgeable in these matters would have to help with that.",

A few PowerShell built-in modules are shipped with the `Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK` nuget package, and when running `dotnet build` or `dotnet publish`, the modules will be deployed to `bin\\...\\runtimes\\win\\lib\\net5.0`, next to the `System.Management.Automation.dll`, whose location is `$PSHOME` for the powershell hosted by the application.\r\n\r\nHowever, when build with `dotnet publish -r <RID>`, all powershell assemblies are deployed in a flat list under `<RID>\\publish` folder, but the modules are still at `<RID>publish\\runtimes\\win\\lib\\net5.0`. So `$PSHOME` becomes `<RID>\\publish` and the `Modules` folder is missing from there.\r\n\r\nThis is a known issue, and it was done so because\r\n1. There was no way (at least at the time when doing this) for a nuget package to choose where to deploy some content files depending on whether or not `-runtime` is specified.\r\n2. Most applications that need to host PowerShell care more about `dotnet publish` scenario due to cross-platform portability.\r\n\r\nSo, the decision was made to accommodate `dotnet build` and `dotnet publish`, and leave `dotnet publish -r <RID>` broken.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is simple, just have a post-build script that copy the `Modules` folder from `<RID>publish\\runtimes\\win\\lib\\net5.0` to `<RID>publish`.",
