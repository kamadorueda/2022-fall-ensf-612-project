    "body": "The `\"English-US is available\"` is a stupid hardcoded message that always appears, it's the next thing I want to fix in `Update-Help` after #17696 and #18037 .\r\n\r\nPlease change the issue title to be more specific, e.g. \"Update-Help fails with 404 error running as admin\", otherwise it's impossible to sort the issues.\r\n\r\nYou specifically mention that you're running it as admin, does running as regular user work? I see all failing modules to be non-builtins, can you check `Update-Help -Module 'Microsoft.Powershell.Core' -Force` to see if the PowerShell's own help servers work? Are you connecting via VPN or have other proxy settings that may cause Internet connection issues. ",
