MshExpression (now PSPropertyExpression) takes a ScriptBlock in its constructor which it will invoke.  But as long as the passed in ScriptBlock is created in a constrained environment it will be marked accordingly and the script block will be invoked with CL mode constraints.  \r\n\r\nA constructor also takes a string \"expression\", but as near as I can tell it is never evaluated as script and is used to look up properties.  Is this correct?\r\n\r\nHowever, we should include a CL mode test to ensure the expression scriptblock is run in CL mode.",
