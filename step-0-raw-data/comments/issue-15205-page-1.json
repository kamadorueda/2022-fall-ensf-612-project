I'm not part of the team so I could be wrong but historically a lot of the security based changes are very conservative and follow the status quo. It's a massive risk security wise to implement their own service for this purpose and fundamentally goes against the standard Windows model where UAC is used.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head one of the security benefits you loose from going this approach is the fact that the UAC consent box is prompted on the secure desktop to try and avoid nefarious software from interacting with it/reading the input. Having it interactive on an existing command line window breaks this feature.\r\n\r\nPut simply I personally doubt PowerShell will implement this at all and think this kind of request is meant to be made against the Windows team which is unrelated to PowerShell. As you said there are 3rd party implementations like gsudo, if you want this functionality then it seems like the common consensus is to just use those.",
