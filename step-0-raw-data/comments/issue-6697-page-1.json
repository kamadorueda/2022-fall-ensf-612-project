In that context I totally _would_ consider aliases, with the mid-term goal of having them as part of one of those modules (Whether they are created right away or introduced as part of that implementation). Given the design goal of convenience, I believe aliases are certainly a justified part of the discussion/deliberations ( _especially_ in cases where the functionality directly maps a string operator).",

I don't see convert(to) being the right verb since it's usually convertto a format and joining a string isn't a format per se. Finally aliases are an important part of the shell experience so simply getting rid of them seems undesirable.\r\n\r\n@FriedrichWeinmann I really **like** this proposal. I've always thought that we missed the boat by not providing core data manipulation commands. I started similar commands back in v1 but they didn't make it into the product. Over the years, we've periodically revisited them (see [Join-Object](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2012/07/13/join-object/)) but again, they didn't get into the product. It would be nice to actually do it this time :-) \r\n\r\n@powercode Would you be willing to contribute your Join-Item (though perhaps renamed `Join-Object`) ? I've seen a number of requests for this type of functionality on StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nOther notes:\r\n\r\n`Split-String` should probably have a `-Count` parameter like the `-Split` operator.\r\nWhat about addressing `.Substring()` scenarios? Maybe have `-start` and `-count` parameters on `split-string`?\r\n\r\n",

From what I can tell, it's one of the reasons many find the language so approachable.  I'll throw my vote in for independent functions/cmdlets any day.\r\n\r\nAlso - @FriedrichWeinmann awesome idea.
