We're unsure whether it makes a lot of sense to have Ignore behave any differently to SilentlyContinue in this instance -- if this combination works it's essentially the same as simply not specifying a -WarningVariable at all.\r\n\r\nCan you share more of your use case here? Why would you use this combination if the expectation is for it to do nothing?\r\n\r\nWe'll mark this as up for grabs for the time being; if anyone has the time to fix it, you're more than welcome to file a PR. ðŸ™‚ ",
