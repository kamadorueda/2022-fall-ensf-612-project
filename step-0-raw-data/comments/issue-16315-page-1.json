    "body": "@jdhitsolutions, your proposition is what I desire. I explain subsequently what my rationale is.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov, I am glad that support for URIs has been previously demonstrated, because such support provides notification of the importance of what I propose:\r\n\r\nConsistent interaction with local and external filesystems is important, not least because my primary utilisation of PowerShell is interaction with identical storage that is formatted as exFAT that is mounted by Windows, macOS, and Linux-based operating-systems. Consequently, consider this:\r\n\r\nLinux – '/media/$USER/56309a5f-0f79-43af-b055-9d657d4cf784/PLACEHOLDER'\r\nWindows – '%systemdrive%\\PLACEHOLDER'\r\nmacOS – '/Volumes/DEC8759E-F77D-3EAE-B3EB-B6438F1AA428/PLACEHOLDER'\r\nAndroid – '/mnt/media_rw/0000-0000/PLACEHOLDER'\r\n\r\n...versus:\r\n\r\nLinux – 'file://localhost//media/$USER/56309a5f-0f79-43af-b055-9d657d4cf784/PLACEHOLDER'\r\nWindows – 'file://localhost/%SYSTEMDRIVE%/PLACEHOLDER'\r\nmacOS – 'file://localhost//Volumes/DEC8759E-F77D-3EAE-B3EB-B6438F1AA428/PLACEHOLDER'\r\nAndroid – 'file://localhost//mnt/media_rw/0000-0000/PLACEHOLDER'\r\n\r\n...whereby \"PLACEHOLDER\" represents the root directory of the drive.\r\n\r\nNot merely is ascertainment of where the storage-device is significantly more consistent, compression is able to be superior because the construction of the URI is more consistent than the construction of the current different paths. Consequently, my opinion is that the constructor that is '-Path' is obsolete because the URI that is 'file://' is entirely superior, and that consequently, files should be interacted with as I describe. The least that I desire is addition of the constructor.",
