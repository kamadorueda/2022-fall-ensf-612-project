The behavior is that a folder's contents are not enumerated for tab-completion until the folder is \"completed\" by appending a slash.\n\nOn Windows, the behavior is a little smarter. If there is only one completion, it is made, and if there are multiple completions, they are listed.\n\nBut this becomes moot if we ship with PSReadline by default, e.g. #833.\n",
