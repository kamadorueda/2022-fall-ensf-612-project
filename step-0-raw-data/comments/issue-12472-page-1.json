    "body": "Being provocative for a moment, if you can get the people who want PowerShell to be as easy as possible for C#-programmers on your side, then you'll have a chance of getting this through.\r\n\r\nGeneral comments without actually saying I'm for/against it (because I do still trip over it, and never use `>` as file redirect anyway); if PowerShell had these operators then they would still not behave exactly like they do in other languages - these use cases might be surprising to people who expect that they will be identical:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"TEST\" == \"test\"    #returns True because -eq is case insensitive.\r\n\r\n1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 <= 5   # returns 1,2,3,4,5  because operators act as filters.\r\n\r\n1,2,3,4,5 == 5   # returns 5, not False.\r\n```\r\n\r\n> It is unconventional with no obvious benefit\r\n\r\nOne benefit is consistency; the same syntax can extend from `-ne` meaning not-equal to `-cne` and `-ine` as case-sensitive and case-insensitive, variants. There is no easy way to write case sensitive and insensitive variants of `>=` which still look like `>=`. The `-ne` style allows for operators like `-match` and `-notcontains` which have no equivalent in other languages.\r\n\r\nThis extends further in the way that `-gt` looks like a cmdlet parameter, and all the operators exist in overloads of the `Where-Object` parameter sets so you can write the following:\r\n\r\n    Get-ChildItem | Where-Object Length -gt 10Kb\r\n\r\nThat `-gt` is not an operator, it's a parameter for Where-Object which looks like an operator; if PowerShell had `>` to mean `-gt` then you might expect to be able to write this:\r\n\r\n    Get-ChildItem | Where-Object Length > 10Kb\r\n\r\nbut that would not work as all parameters must begin with `-`. That would either be an surprising error, or be an unusual special-case for `where-object` which then wouldn't work elsewhere, or it would have large knock-on changes elsewhere in the language to make it work generally.\r\n\r\nAnother point is that `-` in the right place indicates the start of an operator, and tools can use this to offer auto-suggest / intellisense, e.g. if you write `5 -`  in a console window and press Ctrl+Space then you get a list of available operators with help text indicating what they do. If you are not a programmer from another language and don't know that `>=` exists, you might have a harder time finding it from scratch.\r\n\r\nAnd if you are a programmer from another language and want to use `==`, you will still have to be able to read `-eq` in all the scripts which already exist, so you don't save as much as you would if you could ignore the `-eq` style completely.\r\n\r\nIt's worth pointing out that re: \"standard operators\", PowerShell's influence here is Unix shells which use `-eq`: https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/comparison-ops.html so people coming from other shell scripts would be less surprised by `-eq` than people coming from Python/C#/Java are. Maybe there's room for doing something like Bash does for indicating a place where `>` means `greater than` instead of `redirect output to file`?\r\n\r\n    is less than (within double parentheses)\r\n\r\n    ((\"$a\" < \"$b\"))\r\n\r\nyou still wouldn't be able to use that in the same way as in other languages without learning the (Power)Shell specific variant though.\n\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/comparison-ops.html\">Other Comparison Operators</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
