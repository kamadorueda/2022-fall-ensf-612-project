    "body": "So `AutoHotkey` isn't a console application, so typically PowerShell doesn't wait for it's completion before returning.  I think stdin is still being shared though, so `AutoHotkey` thinks it's still waiting for more script.\r\n\r\nAs a workaround, if you pipe the output of `AutoHotkey` to something it'll force it to wait until completion and properly close stdin.  e.g.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n'WinMaximize, ahk_class ENMainFrame' | D:\\path\\to\\AutoHotkey\\AutoHotkey.exe * | Write-Output\r\n```",

Do you think this is a AutoHotkey bug instead (maybe it's not acknowledging the EOF or something)? Should I submit a bug report to AHK? Or do you think pwsh is failing to close stdin properly in this case?",
