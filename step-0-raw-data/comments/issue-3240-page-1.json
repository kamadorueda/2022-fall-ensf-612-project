There are some neat tricks possible in PS that are great in a pinch or if you need a one-time shorthand.\r\n\r\nFor maintainable code, ideally we should have explicit null-coalescing operators like C#. The main trouble there for me is -- what do we use for those? `?` is already aliased to `Where-Object` (much as I'd love for that to be erased, it's in *very* common use). Mind you, `%` is aliased to `ForEach-Object` but that doesn't hinder modulus operations, so in theory at least having `?` be a null-coalescing operator as well would potentially be fine; it would only be interpreted as such in expressions, where `Where-Object` isn't really valid anyway.",

    "body": "> the benefit of member existence checking by default\r\n\r\nPS contains code which does member checking, and returns $null when they don't exist. That's a benefit by default, which you can also avoid by writing your own member existence test with `$x.psobject.properties...` if you choose to. StrictMode takes away that benefit and leaves the *hinderence* of having to write existence tests. Then instead of giving a nice way to write exactly a member existence test, `?.` would give you a concise workaround to get what `.` always did. And if it matters that the member exists, you still have to code that separately.\r\n\r\nBut this does make me ask what about method calls:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$x.pretend     -> $null\r\n$x.pretend()   -> Exception MethodNotFound\r\n$x?.pretend  -> $null\r\n$x?.pretend()   -> ____ what goes here? $null?\r\n\r\nset-strictmode -version 2\r\n$x.pretend -> Exception PropertyNotFoundStrict\r\n$x.pretend()  -> Exception MethodNotFound\r\n$x?.pretend  -> $null\r\n$x?.pretend()   -> ____  ?\r\n```\r\n\r\ni.e `?.` would behave the same as `.` for property lookups in non-strictmode, but would behave differently to `.` for method calls in non-strictmode, making it nuanced and not a drop-in replacement. Does that mean that when using `?.` you would have no way at all to tell whether a method was invoked, or nothing at all happened? Properties can be backed by getter methods, but I think it's convention in DotNet for getters not to mutate internal state, but normal for method calls to mutate state. With `?.` you would have no idea if you mutated an object's state?\r\n\r\nI wonder if you can get the desired benefits, and better, by making `??` able to handle PropertyNotFoundException and MethodNotFound Exceptions directly from the expression on the left (but not other Exceptions raised inside methods), as well as handling $nulls, and not have `?.` at all. e.g.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$varThatMayBeNull ?? $fallbackValue # null-coalescing\r\n#\r\n$varThatMayBeNull.Name ?? $fallbackvalue    # catching PropertyNotFoundStrict exception\r\n$varThatMayBeNull.Name ??  # default fallback is $null\r\n$varThatMayBeNull.Method() ??  # catching MethodNotFound Exception\r\n\r\n# and potentially addressing the index case too\r\n$varThatMayBeNull.first.second[3].Method() ??  # catching MethodNotFound Exception, or index not found Exception\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then, instead of `?.` calling a member or accessing a property, it could be a concise way of asking if a member exists, returning a [bool]. \r\n\r\nWith the same syntax addition of `??` and `?.` you could handle more situations, with less confusing overlap.\r\n",

    "body": "As for _method calls_, which the OP doesn't cover:\r\n\r\n_Method calls_ (e.g., `$varThatMayBeNull.Method()`) and _indexing_ (e.g., `$varThatMayBeNull[$index]`) are two cases where even strict mode being off or at version 1 could benefit, given that both cases currently _invariably_ cause an error if the value being accessed is `$null`.\r\n\r\nThe syntax would be same as for properties for methods - `$varThatMayBeNull?.Method()` - and analogous for indexing - `$varThatMayBeNull?[$index]` - as in C#.\r\n\r\n_Update_: There is a second aspect to indexing, namely if the variable is non-null, but the element at the given index doesn't exist (e.g., `$arr = 0,1; $arr[2]`). With strict mode version 2 or below, this evaluates to `$null`, but in version 3 or higher it causes an error, and it would be nice to be able to opt out of this error as well. However, the syntax for this case presents a challenge - see the updated OP, which currently proposes the perhaps awkward `[...?]`.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, I would make such access default to `$null` as well, even for methods - again, you're _explicitly_ signaling that it's fine to do nothing if the object being accessed is `$null` or if no such array element exists.\r\n\r\nNote that C# has no null-conditional indexing in the second sense.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

With `?.` it would be so convenient to use it instead of `.` and make code also work in strictmode that I may as well use it everywhere habitually; I lose nothing and gain compatibility. I fear all PowerShell code will uglify in that way because it \"works\" in more cases.\r\n\r\nBut it isn't a drop-in replacement, because it silences failed method call lookup in non-strictmode, and silences failed property lookups in strictmode - it adds a fiddly nuance to member lookup, an incredibly common operation. It doesn't help anyone who wants to benefit from strictmode checks by making that boilerplate easier. It doesn't help enough people in enough situations, for the complexity it adds. And it's too convenient to make code more compatible, I don't think \"ignore it if you don't want it\" is strong enough to hold it at bay.\r\n\r\nPowerShell can do things C# doesn't, like setting automatic variables, or having a precedent for having exceptions be thrown and silenced behind the scenes. *There's got to be a better approach* which doesn't complexify member lookup at all, but simplifies strictmode safety check boilerplate so that people who do want to use the checks have easier lives and people who were annoyed by the checks have easier lives as well. \r\n\r\n",

With `?.` as discussed, `$null?.x` is silent, `$null?.x()` is silent. \r\n\r\nSo you'd have a `.` which works like C#'s `?.`, except in strict-mode where it throws exceptions. Then you'd have a `?.` which works in strict mode like C#'s `?.` and like PowerShell's `.` works in in non-strict mode, but which works differently to PowerShell's `.` in non-strict mode for method calls. What a horrible combination, (and a combination where `?.` is clearly better and more useful in more of those scenarios).\r\n\r\n> You would have to write a load of exception handling and null checks previously, instead: `$prop = $item?.Method().PropIwant ?? 'PropActionFailed'`\r\n\r\nYour method call might throw, or return $null and PropIWant might be missing, you'd still have to write:\r\n\r\n    $prop = try {\r\n        $item?.Method()?.PropIwant ?? 'PropActionFailed'  \r\n    } catch [someMethodException] {\r\n        'PropActionFailed'\r\n    }\r\n\r\nvs with my proposed `??` (if it was possible to build), and no need for `?.`, and it covers possible cases of Method exceptions in case all you care about is \"success or not\" and no detailed error handling.\r\n\r\n    $prop = $item.Method().PropIWant ?? 'AnythingFailed'\r\n\r\n>  If you want more adopters, you need to make it easier to read code, which I feel this suggestion does.\r\n\r\nHow often do you type `.` in PowerShell? How often do you want to explain to new users what the difference is between `.` and `?.` and tell them they have to consider the difference *every time they type a `.` forever*?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how did that come about?\" \"Well in C# `.` threw an exception for missing members, so they invented `?.` which didn't. That was great, so they did that in PowerShell by default, the `.` doesn't throw. Then they invented strict-mode which makes `.` behave like C# and throw but only in that context, But the way to manually check members was really wordy and bothersome and nobody wanted to type it; instead of addressing that problem head-on and making that more convenient to benefit from the strictmode, they dodged that and aped C#'s `?.` instead to gain a sneaky way out of the strictness that you asked for, which is mildly convenient for you, but sucks for everyone else. And you still have no member existence test, and benefiting from strictmode is still wordy and bothersome, but at least you don't have to suffer that because 'strictmode' has a 'normalmode' escape hatch now\". Ick.\r\n\r\n> If I wrote strict code that fails when you use it, then one of us made a mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\n> although I don't see why you think a simple null check on member lookups would be a bad thing, the actual member lookup is way more expensive than if (result is null)\r\n\r\nI don't think that would be bad, PS non-strictmode already does that, and I think that would be a desirable alternative to the proposed `?.` - very different, useful in more situations.\r\n\r\nBut note that in PS you can do something C# cannot:\r\n\r\n    (1..3)[1kb..100kb]\r\n\r\nand no exceptions in non-strictmode. Change the numbers and see how long it takes; judging by the performance and how I think it must work behind the scenes to index into arbitrary objects, it seems there *actually are* ~100,000 exceptions being raised and silenced, for our convenience. PS doesn't always make the \"must be as fast as possible, push the inconvenience on the user\" choice, and I like that about it.\r\n",

    "body": "> @KirkMunro having \"prioritized parsing\" sounds like an open door for bugs.\r\n\r\n@TheIncorrigible1: Any code can open the door for bugs if it's not implemented properly. I'm just talking about a simple single-character lookahead to identify if PowerShell runs into a ternary or null-* operator when it parses a variable name that is not enclosed in variable bounds and encounters a `?` character. That's not complicated, and doesn't open the door for more bugs than any other code change does.\r\n\r\n> People on PowerShell 7 are likely already enthusiasts and will be aware of the breaking changes. People who are not, are still using <=v5.1 and will continue to for a long time; likely until msft removes it from Windows 10 (never).\r\n\r\n@TheIncorrigible1: What basis/evidence do you have of that statement? PowerShell 7 is in preview, so today it's only used by enthusiasts. That's a given. But beyond preview, if PowerShell 7 or later offer compelling features that companies need, while supporting the functionality they need, they'll use those versions. That is especially true if PowerShell 7 gets installed with the OS. The only point that enthusiasts comes into play is in organizations that don't have a business need for what PowerShell 7 brings to the table.\r\n\r\n> That already is going to be a breaking change, and I'd think it best to at least be consistent about it and go all the way rather than introduce another level of ambiguity. 🙂\r\n\r\n@vexx32 That's stretching it. It would be a breaking change if you had `??` in a variable name, but the likelihood of that is much more remote than having a variable whose name ends in a single `?`. Other than that, how would the introduction of null-* operators while still supporting `?` as a standard permissible variable character break scripts today?\r\n\r\nIn my experience breaking changes for nice-to-haves (which is what this seems to be) are by far more often than not rejected, and the discussion/arguments around them only serve to slow down the process of getting things done dramatically, to the point where things just stall or miss getting into a release, etc. The slow down is often necessary, because if you're proposing a breaking change evidence is needed to be able to assess the impact and justify such a change. It's hard to gather that evidence today. I'm just saying this because I'll choose getting features done now over arguing about a nice-to-have breaking change any day.\r\n\r\nI never use `?` in variable names, nor would I. I expect some folks do, though, because it can read very well in a script, and putting up unnecessary barriers to entry for PowerShell 7 just slows down adoption, especially when many people working with PowerShell aren't developers who are more accustomed to working through breaking changes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it is not my intent to slow down this process -- rather the opposite. But I've shared my thoughts and experience, so I won't comment further on whether or not we should push for a breaking change here.",

    "body": "> @KirkMunro if PowerShell 7 or later offer compelling features that companies need, while supporting the functionality they need, they'll use those versions. That is especially true if PowerShell 7 gets installed with the OS.\r\n\r\nHaving worked in a few Fortune 50s with some employee bases being in the hundreds of thousands, even getting away from what was default on the OS was a challenge (i.e., moving to v5.x).  I have yet to see any place adopt *Core*; they'd rather just move to Python for cross-compatibility.  Enabling Windows optional features was also a pretty seldom task.\r\n\r\nI think companies work with what they have and the knowledge base of their employees over seeking out new technology or language versions to solve their problems.  Some would be perfectly content staying on v2 forever and never touching the Win10/Server16 cmdlets that make life dramatically easier.\r\n\r\nMy point with all of this, is that these features are not in a vacuum.  If you make a language more ergonomic, it will see greater adoption by people being interested in the tool to solve the problems they have faster.  (See: C# and the growth in popularity with more/better language features)",

    "body": "Are options 1 and 2 not the same? Or would variables still be permitted to use `?` in the case that there is no null-coalescing or ternary operator following them?\r\n\r\nIf so, I think we may have a lot of trouble handling the tokenizing / parsing logic without a lot of backtracking. This might lead to performance degradations when variables end with `?`.\r\n\r\nGiven that from what I can see, option 2 seems to be the general preference, I'm not really sure I understand the reluctance to make the breaking change here. Doing it that way will actively discourage use of `?` in variable names anyway, simply by introducing scenarios that they aren't usable without enclosing the variable name. \r\n\r\nI think this is a fairly minor change as breaking changes go, and having a break in the consistency of what can and can't be used in a variable name is probably the worse option, in my opinion. \r\n\r\nThese things should have clear rules that apply in pretty much all situations. Currently, this is the case. We're proposing to muddy the waters here and make the behaviour _less_ clear. I can't see anything good coming from it, except perhaps that variable names containing `?` become less used simply because they're harder to use in some scenarios -- which (effectively) brings us right back to option 1 by default, almost... so I don't see any particular reason not to take the break now and just avoid the ambiguous behaviour.",

On the other hand, anyone using the functionality described here will be able to understand a slightly more complicated syntax (like `${foo}?.bar`). Therefore, we prefer [option 3](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3240#issuecomment-524431897) because it avoids breaking changes on these less experienced users. (But again, we will validate it per the first bullet.)\r\n* @daxian-dbw raised a good point about making it harder to find all variable references when scripters are mixing usage of `$foo` and `${foo}`. However, we agreed that this can be fixed in tooling (like the VS Code PowerShell extension), and users like @JamesWTruher who use editors like Vim can easily match on both with their search syntax.

    "body": "@rjmholt, quoting you  from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10967#issuecomment-561843650:\r\n\r\n> not breaking the way we parse existing valid syntax was the right way to go. Again, a change there isn't just a case of us making a decision to support a small number of wild programs out there — we've made numerous breaking changes in cases where we thought the pros outweighed the cons (not that I personally agree with all of them, or that those do or don't justify others). The issue is that changing some aspect of the tokenizer or parser means that two PowerShell versions will no longer generate the same AST for some scripts, so two PowerShells will \"see\" the same script differently. That means we can't even read the syntax the same way, so there's no PSScriptAnalyzer rule you can write to pick up possible issues around it; PSScriptAnalyzer will see a different syntax from one PowerShell version to the next.\r\n\r\n> Unlike C#, PowerShell can't pre-compile a different syntax to a compatible format for later execution, meaning that a syntactic change is tethered to the runtime. Once PowerShell makes a syntactic break, we reduce the number of scripts that can work against different versions, meaning users are forced to write two scripts, which is a serious issue for a shell and a scripting language. PowerShell is supposed to be dynamic enough to bend past all the differences with logic inside one script, but the syntax is the one non-negotiably static thing we have. And making a syntax change where both before and after are valid is especially pernicious, since there's no simple way to detect it, there's no warning for it and even after executing it in both environments, users might not know that a different behaviour occurred.\r\n\r\nIn general, I can appreciate that such changes can be very problematic and should only be made if the pros outweigh the cons, an important factor of which is how much existing code breaks.\r\n\r\n> we reduce the number of scripts that can work against different versions\r\n> meaning users are forced to write two scripts\r\n\r\nWe're talking about a _new_ syntactic feature here (`?.`), so by definition scripts that use it _cannot_ (meaningfully) run on older versions - unless you specifically add conditionals that provide legacy-version-compatible code paths, but that seems hardly worth it - you would then just stick with the legacy features.\r\n\r\nYes, the interpretation of `$var?.foo` in old scripts that used `$var?` as  a variable name would break, but:\r\n\r\n* `?` should never have been allowed as part of an identifier _without enclosing it in `{...}`_.\r\n\r\n* Since being able to do so is unexpected and probably even _unknown_ to many, such variable names are exceedingly rare in the wild, speaking from personal experience, but [@mburszley's analysis provides more tangible evidence](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3240#issuecomment-526179551).\r\n\r\n   * Even Ruby only allows `?` (and `!`) at the _end_ of identifiers, and there only of _method_ identifiers, and I suspect that most Ruby users are aware that they should _not_ assume that other languages support the same thing.\r\n\r\nSo, pragmatically speaking:\r\n\r\n* The vast majority of existing code will not be affected - a token such as `$var?.foo` will simply not be encountered.\r\n\r\n* If you write `$var?.foo` with the new semantics, then yes, running that on older versions could result in different behavior (rather than breaking in an obvious manner), depending on what strict mode is in effect - but _you should always enforce the minimum version required to run your code as intended anyway_ (`#requires -Version`, module-manifest keys).\r\n\r\nAll in all, to me this a clear case of a bucket 3 change: a technically breaking change that breaks very little existing code while offering real benefits (or, conversely, avoiding perennial headaches due to unexpected behavior).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
