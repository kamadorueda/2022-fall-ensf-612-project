    "body": "@msftrncs The improvement has only gone into v7. The improvement means that for patch (and I also think minor or major) upgrades of the MSI, the shortcut will be preserved. In any situation where the default installation path changes like e.g. from v6 to v7, I'd expect to change the GUID by design because the shortcut will point to the old, wrong location anyway. In a nutshell: The first upgrade from v6 to v7 will require a re-pin but any further minor or patch updates to v7 will not suffer from this problem.\r\nAlso please remember: You might see the icon disappear after a reboot but the pinned link on the taskbar still works. The icon issue seems to be a difficult Windows issue that would need to be worked around, which seems to be very hard when using WiX, I've asked in the WiX mailing list and got no answer.",
