That's a handy mnemonic to understand why files always have default (unnamed) data streams, and why directories can never have default data streams.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I can't figure out the path by which the property is set, so I can't figure out if I have enough information available anywhere to communicate to that location that even though the filesystem entry is a directory it's actually a stream on a directory.\r\n\r\nIf you have any suggestions to figuring out how it works, I am attentive.

You apparently can't use `Get-Item drive:\\directory:*` as a synonym for `Get-Item drive:\\directory -Stream *`, which means that when it passes through `private static FileSystemInfo GetFileSystemInfo(string path, out bool isContainer)` it doesn't get a stream name.  So, even though that seems to be where `isContainer` is set, it apparently doesn't get enough information for Get-Item to be able to say it's not a container.\r\n\r\nI can't figure out where \"Stream\" is added as a dynamic parameter, so I can't really do anything there either.  Ideally, if PSChildName contains a `':'`, `isContainer` should be reset to `false` before it's returned.",
