    "body": "The underlying problem is the links for libcrypto.so.1.0.0 and libssl.so.1.0.0 were not created by package.psm1.  This occurs when building directly on redhat; something we typically do not do; we build on Centos and use it on redhat.  See the logic for setting `IsRedHatFamily` in [Get-EnvironmentInformation](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/791159d615adf6cdeb67940413d2e96ea0c61274/build.psm1#L100)\r\nA possible fix is to add  an explicit IsRedHat variable and detection then update `IsRedHatFamily` to include it in the decision.",
