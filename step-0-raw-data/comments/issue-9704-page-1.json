These are used for scope modifiers, and while there are cases where it _appears_ that a given variable might have that as part of its name, almost all usable cases result in that portion of the name being taken as a scope modifier or PSDrive accessor, as intended. What _should not_ be possible is the creation of a variable **in the variable: drive** where the actual variable name contains a `:` character.\r\n\r\nThere isn't really a good reason to allow this, in my opinion, and it makes more sense to expressly forbid it due to the unavoidable issues it causes thanks to its use as a drive or scope qualifier.",

    "body": "Lets not forget, that using the `${ }` notation, ALL characters are valid, including control characters!  Also the same applies to the variable -name argument of the variable CMDLETs, all characters are valid (though wildcards may need to be escaped).  The only places there are restrictions are with the `$` sigil.\r\n\r\nLets explain, to the best of my knowledge, what is going on in the tokenizer:\r\n- Meets a `$`, possibly variable or substatement\r\n- Valid second characters are `$`, `^`, `{`, `:`, `?` or \\w (all the letter characters in Unicode, which includes `_` and numeric digits)\r\n- `$` and `^` end the variable name immediately\r\n- `{` begins a expanded character set name, escaping is required for some characters, but any character is otherwise valid, the name ends with an un-escaped `}`\r\n- otherwise the name is any `:` (as long as the next character is also not `:`), `?` or \\w, until a non allowed character is met.\r\n- If none of the above matches, then an alternate second character is `(`, which then tokenizes a substatement.\r\n- not a substatement, then the `$` is included in any already ongoing token, and that ongoing token continues.\r\n\r\nOnly after the name is tokenized does drive and scope get decoded, using the first `:` regardless of the method used to tokenize.  A blank drive or scope is allowed, but the first `:` is then removed with the process, making it not part of the variable name.\r\n\r\nSo it this point it would complicate tokenizing to change the current behavior.  The `:` becomes an allowed character in the variable name because it must be accepted by the tokenizer in the basic name category in order to capture the drive or scope.\r\n\r\nThe variable CMDLETs need to be fixed.  They neither seem to actually allow a scope to be specified in the -name parameter (which I don't think they should), nor do they work if you do try to, which indicates they are broken, even though they work for all other variable names that include `:`, plus `get-variable` / `set-variable` work correctly.  Then the issue would only be a small issue of confusion by new users as to how to specify the scope part to the variable CMDLETs.   Do note that the variable CMDLET's accept all characters for variable names, since the variable name is an argument.\r\n\r\nI do think its weird that in some places the `variable:` drive accepts scopes and in some places it doesn't.  In the variable namespace notation, it doesn't, but in certain CMDLETs it does, such as 'remove-item' and 'get-content'\r\n\r\nEDIT: I previously was in error regarding `\\p{L}`.  The actual regex construct equivalent would have been `\\w`.",
