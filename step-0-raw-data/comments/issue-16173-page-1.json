    "body": "@TobiasPSP  I saw this in the working group, but it's probably better to put my input here. \r\n\r\nTo me the **main** use case for dynamic parameters has always been the parameter which only appears if some condition is satisfied.  It is a pain to have to refer to these through $psboundParameters because dynamic parameters aren't automatically accessible as `$ParamName`. I would see just fixing that as a win. \r\n\r\nWe already have a `DontShow` member for parameters which we want to be _accepted_ by not _suggested_ to the user;  a  \"Don't show _and_ error if it is given\" option which is evaluated at run time would address the need for dynamically appearing / disappearing parameters. Something like ` [ArgumentCompleter( )]`  which takes either a type or a ScriptBlock , strikes me as ideal - especially if it took the same arguments. \r\n\r\nThere are many cases where we want to say \"If switch A is specified hide B and C\"  and we send people to parameter sets for that - which is OK if there is already only one parameter set - we put A in one set and B&C in another.  \r\nBut if we already have multiple parameter sets  like \"By-ID\" and \"By-Name\" we need to make   \"By-ID-withA\" \"By-ID-withoutA\" and \"By-Name-withA\" \"By-Name-withoutA\", and put everything in the correct pair of sets.   If we also want to hide Y and Z when X is shown, and we have By-Address as well name and ID we end up with 4 combinations of with/without A and X multiplied by 3 selections, and making sure everything has the right 3 or 4 from 12 becomes a nightmare.  **This suggestion could simplify parameter sets**  which would also be a win.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest case where I have seen aspects of the parameter were built dynamically was the VSTeam (Azure DevOps) module - where validation sets were built on the fly with information fetched from the server. \r\nEnumerating commands can cause their dynamic parameters to be generated and IIRC there were well over 100 of these parameters which meant `Get- [tab]`  caused the machine to stop while dozens of API calls were made and the results processed.  So the Dynamic parameters became static parameters with classes doing the work. \r\n\r\nWithout this case and the hide/show usage, the other build-at-run-time parameters I've met don't many common requirements and often need a lot of code which best kept out of the `param()` block.  I can imagine cases were we want other properties of the parameter to change dynamically for example `-P`  becomes mandatory only if  `-Q`  has a negative value.  But is any a sufficient pain point to justify a change.   \r\n\r\nI think \" there/not there \" is the case with real benefit, and it might be better to have name for this that is distinct from \"dynamic\"  It's something in the same family as completers, transformers, and validators \r\n",

    "body": "That probably **is** better use of limited resources, but still a pity. \r\nThis remains a good idea - dynamic parameters are not commonly used AND using them is so painful as things stand.  I originally wrote BECAUSE instead of \"AND\" - I think there is a causal link, but I can't prove it. \r\n \r\nI'm cross that I missed the discussion. I would like to know if there's a feeling that the _need_ is small - that may be true, but  **I think** there are people who are neither using parameter sets (because putting each of 10 parameters in the right combination of 10 sets is for Masochists only)  nor using dynamic parameters (for similar reasons) and writing something inside a function to trap impossible combinations.  If that is so then the low use of dynamic parameters is proof that this **is** needed, not that it isn't :-) \r\n",
