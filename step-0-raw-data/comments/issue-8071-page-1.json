    "body": "Sorry for the delay on reviewing this PR. `EngineIntrinsics` exposes methods for invoking script/scriptblock, however, the invocation happens in the default Runspace of the current invoking thread, so unless you are calling `$rs.EngineIntrinsics.InvokeCommand.InvokeScript` from script that is running within `$rs`, it will be using a different Runspace -- the default Runspace associated with the current thread, which is often `null` in a C# application that hosts powershell.\r\n\r\nHere is an example to demonstrate this:\r\n```\r\n$rs = [runspacefactory]::CreateRunspace()\r\n$rs.Open()\r\n$ps = [powershell]::Create()\r\n$ps.Runspace = $rs\r\n\r\n## Host name of the default powershell console host\r\n$host.Name\r\n> ConsoleHost\r\n\r\n## Host name of the Runspace host\r\n$ps.AddScript('$host.Name').Invoke()\r\n> Default Host\r\n\r\n## Run start-sleep to block $rs\r\n$ps.Commands.Clear()\r\n$ps.AddScript(\"Sleep -s 100\") > $null\r\n$cb = $ps.BeginInvoke()\r\n\r\n## Invoke a script using $rs.EngineIntrinsics returns 'ConsoleHost'\r\n## because it run the script using the default Runspace of the current thread\r\n$rs.EngineIntrinsics.InvokeCommand.InvokeScript('$host.Name')\r\n> ConsoleHost\r\n```\r\n`$ExecutionContext` works fine in a PowerShell session because the current running thread (pipeline thread) always has the right default Runspace where `InvokeCommand.InvokeScript` should execute the script in. But in a C# application, there is no such guarantee, and because of this confusing semantics, I don't think we should introduce this public API.",

I have code today where I use reflection to pull out this property, but I shouldn't have to use reflection to get it. This is in use in HistoryPx, FormatPx, SnippetPx, and other modules that have been in use for a while. I understand your concerns, but reflection shouldn't be necessary here, and I still think it's worth making this public so that .NET developers can access it directly when they need to. Maybe there's a better way to expose it though, so that the semantics always make sense. What if it was exposed off of PSCmdlet instead, so that it can be used in cmdlets, which should always have the right context? Or other ideas?",

If the semantics are confusing, documentation should help.\r\n\r\nHere is where I have this in use in modules today:\r\n\r\n### HistoryPx\r\n\r\n* In the OnImport method of a class derived from IModuleAssemblyInitializer, I use EngineIntrinsics to get the SessionState so that I can get the value of a variable from the PSVariable collection.\r\n* In the OnRemove method of a class derived from IModuleAssemblyCleanup, I use EngineIntrinsics to get the SessionState to remove a variable from the PSVariable collection.\r\n\r\n### FormatPx\r\n\r\n* I retrieve EngineIntrinsics from the default runspace in a helper class to try to retrieve the buffersize from Host.UI.RawUI.\r\n\r\n### SnippetPx\r\n\r\n* I retrieve EngineIntrinsics from the default runspace to then call InvokeCommand.GetCommand on it to see if I am able to find a command within a file.\r\n\r\nThose are examples in use today where I have used reflection to get at what I need within binary modules. It would be better if reflection was not needed in those scenarios, which is where this PR came from.",

    "body": "> ### HistoryPx\r\n>\r\n> * In the OnImport method of a class derived from IModuleAssemblyInitializer, I use EngineIntrinsics to get the SessionState so that I can get the value of a variable from the PSVariable collection.\r\n> * In the OnRemove method of a class derived from IModuleAssemblyCleanup, I use EngineIntrinsics to get the SessionState to remove a variable from the PSVariable collection.\r\n\r\nYou can create a PowerShell instance via `PowerShell.Create(RunspaceMode.CurrentRunspace)` and then query for the variable using the PowerShell instance.\r\n\r\n> ### FormatPx\r\n> \r\n> * I retrieve EngineIntrinsics from the default runspace in a helper class to try to retrieve the buffersize from Host.UI.RawUI.\r\n\r\nIf possible, the buffersize can be passed in to the helper class from a cmdlet, which can easily get the buffer size info from `this.Host`.\r\nIf that's not possible, then again, you can use `PowerShell.Create(RunspaceMode.CurrentRunspace)` and query for the host using it.\r\n\r\n> ### SnippetPx\r\n>\r\n> * I retrieve EngineIntrinsics from the default runspace to then call InvokeCommand.GetCommand on it to see if I am able to find a command within a file.\r\n\r\nSame here, `PowerShell.Create(RunspaceMode.CurrentRunspace)` can be used reliably for this purpose.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn fact, all APIs other than `Host` that are exposed by `$ExecutionContext` are already available from `Runspace`:\r\n```\r\nPS:48> [runspace]::DefaultRunspace.SessionStateProxy\r\n\r\nApplications   :\r\nScripts        :\r\nDrive          :\r\nLanguageMode   : FullLanguage\r\nModule         :\r\nPath           :\r\nProvider       :\r\nPSVariable     :\r\nInvokeCommand  :\r\nInvokeProvider :\r\n```\r\nHowever,\r\n1. their values are set to `null` when the `Runspace` is busy (running). The reason I guess is to prevent two threads acting on the same Runspace, but the implementation didn't take into account that this may happen in the same thread too -- query for information while running in pipeline.\r\n2. not sure about others, but `InvokeCommand` is somewhat broken in two folds\r\n    - The methods `GetCmdlet`, `GetCommand` might trigger module auto-loading for command discovery, while module auto-loading depends on `PowerShell.Create(RunspaceMode.CurrentRunspace)`. So in case auto-loading is needed, those API will either fail because there is no default `Runspace` associate with the current thread (think about calling in C#), or will load the module in the default `Runspace` and return a `CommandInfo` object associated with the wrong `ExecutionContext`.\r\n    - The method `InvokeScript` broken in the same way as I described above in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/8071#issuecomment-439192986\r\n",
