    "body": "@pcgeek86 My impression was that with the general usage of ```-Verbose``` is that one either gets no verbose output or everything. For example consider when calling function A that calls function B internally, the ```VerbosePreference``` propagates from A to B by default without doing anything. That's why I thought that this would be the more common and intuitive default and in the special case if one really wanted the Verbose output from ```Invoke-Command``` only but not the ```ScriptBlock``` one could still pass the desired ```VerbosePreference``` to the ```ScriptBlock``` as ```Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {[CmdletBinding()]Param($VerbosePreference) Write-Verbose \"Hello World\"} -Verbose -ArgumentList ('SilentlyContinue')```\r\nThis is certainly a more philosophical discussion but to me it would make the behaviour more consistent and intuitive. Should the outcome of this discussion be a change, then one would most certainly also need to include other preferences such as ```InformationPreference``` (and maybe even the ```WhatIfPreference```).",

It is confusing and adds extra work.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, the expectation with `Invoke-Command` is to execute all statements within the script block remotely. Output is already routing back to the local terminal session to be displayed. So when you see `Write-Verbose` statements, and `-Verbose` set on the Cmdlet, you expect it to show up. \r\n\r\nAs for the conflict with `Invoke-Command` having it's own Verbose statements, as far as I can tell, there are none. If there were, it wouldn't be an issue with `-Debug` or `-Verbose` showing the connection activities mixed in with my Verbose. It could actually help if something were broken in remoting.",
