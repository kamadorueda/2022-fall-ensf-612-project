There is a difference between those APIs / native binaries which makes us use runtime folders for each supported OS https://github.com/PowerShell/MMI/issues/45#issuecomment-651241560\r\n- mi.dll is written using managed-c which is not supported by NET 5+\r\n- in order to fix this it would require rewriting mi.dll into c# but there are no plans for it: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4562#issuecomment-398881699\r\n\r\nSo you need to provide non-portable RIDs if you want a self-contained app.",

    "body": "Thank you @ALIENQuake, that makes a lot of sense. If nothing else, this issue could probably be solved by adding a note to the SDK documentation (unless there's a way to generate a self-contained portable target compile-time warning which would be even better). More than the limitation itself, the problem is that there doesn't appear to be a way to discover it until it crops up at runtime in application testing.",
