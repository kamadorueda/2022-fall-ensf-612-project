    "body": "The fundamental problem is that we have to parse a command in the module to work out what it exports. This is not practicable in general:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$body = (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://mywebsite.com/api/pwsh-export').Body\r\n\r\nExport-ModuleMember -Function ($body.Functions)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere's no way to determine what that actually exports without running the code and sending a network request.\r\n\r\nIt's a contrived example perhaps, but it's (1) quite possible and (2) representative of things like string templating, variable mangling and cmdlet use (`Join-Path` for example) that might be used.\r\n\r\nSo we can never actually always determine the exports, it's just not possible. I personally dislike that we try, since it means exports like this are only reliable if you provide concrete values to `Export-ModuleMember` -- so when you get more clever and it stops working, it's hard to explain why.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov I understand the principle, although I'm not entirely sure it's intentional. There's code that seems to do it here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/50efc4192d99bbbe20c34e03ab04aa2f7d7d82b1/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/ScriptAnalysis.cs#L20-L91\r\n\r\nHowever, I haven't been able to catch it in the debugger at all.",
