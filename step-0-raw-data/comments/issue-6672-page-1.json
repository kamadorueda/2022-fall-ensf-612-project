So consider a set of modules all annotated to compile but only a subset are actually called. You end up taking the time/space hit from compiling unnecessarily. As was the case with the `register` keyword in C, the compiler can figure out low-level resource allocation better than the script author so I don't think this is a desirable thing long-term. Improving hotspot detection seems like a better place to invest resources.",
