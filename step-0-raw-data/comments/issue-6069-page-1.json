DNS and the IPv6 vs IPv4 certainly plays a key role... but the fact that ,NET Core is orders of magnitude slower than .NET Framework at dealing with the exact same name resolution dilemma.. I'd say that is a .NET Core problem.... pretty much al HTTP APIs are wrapping the same low level API as HttpClient and some of the others (such as WebRequest) are wrapping HttpClient... anyway semantics aside...\r\n\r\nAre there other tests outside of the Web Cmdlets that are accessing something on localhost? If they are and they are using any of the HTTP APIs then they could be converted to 127.0.0.1 for some performance gain. I wasn't aware of any such tests.\r\n\r\nIt's really important for the Web Client tests because we are breaking 5 seconds for redirect tests and the sheer volume of calls made to localhost really add up the test time.
