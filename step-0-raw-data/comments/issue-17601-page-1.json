    "body": "Re backward-compatibility: there might be PowerShell code that lazily initializes an IntPtr, and has a variable whose value is one of:\r\n\r\n- $Null if the IntPtr has not been needed yet, and initialization has not been attempted\r\n- [IntPtr]::Zero if the initialization failed and should not be attempted again\r\n- nonzero IntPtr if the initialization succeeded\r\n\r\nIf code like that uses a conversion to bool (rather than a comparison to $Null), and PowerShell starts treating [IntPtr]::Zero as false, then it can cause the code to retry the initialization more times than the developer intended, and perhaps hurt performance. I imagine code like that would be rare in PowerShell but anyway the risk exists.\r\n\r\nThere is a plan to make C# treat IntPtr as an integer type (<https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/6065>). If that is implemented and libraries start returning numbers (rather than only handles and pointers) as IntPtr, then it becomes more important to treat IntPtr consistently with other integer types in PowerShell too. That would preferably include making `([IntPtr]1 + [IntPtr]1)` evaluate to to [IntPtr]2 rather than [Int32]2. IntPtr arithmetic in PowerShell doesn't have to be done at the same time as this [bool][IntPtr]::Zero change, though.",

Especially pre-open-source, PowerShell users were successfully trained to resign themselves to what they were given and to live with workarounds.)\r\n\r\nFor that reason, (not-too-breaking) wart removals are compelling _in general_, except perhaps if the implementation effort is too great, which I don't think is the case here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
