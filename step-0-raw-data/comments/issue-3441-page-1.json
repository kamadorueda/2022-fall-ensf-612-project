    "body": "@iSazonov The goal of the original code was to ensure that the cmdlet did not attempt to copy a file onto itself, and it did so by doing a case-insensitive compare of the two normalized paths. That worked fine on FAT volumes, on NTFS volumes under Windows in its default mode, and on HFS+ volumes on OS X. In your example, it would consider `/etc/sysctl.conf` and `/etc/sysctl.CONF` to be the same file and would not allow the copy. On a case-sensitive file system such as ext under Linux, or NTFS under either Linux or OS X, those two paths are generally *not* the same file, so the copy should be allowed to continue, which is the complaint in issue #1930. I'm fairly confident that if you ran `copy-item /etc/sysctl.conf /etc/sysctl.CONF` under WSL it would fail with an error saying it cannot copy the file onto itself.\r\n\r\nThen consider links. If file A is a file on a volume, and file B is a hard or symbolic link to file A, copying A to B would actually be copying A onto itself, which the cmdlet does not allow but cannot be detected by merely comparing two path strings.\r\n\r\nThe new code determines whether two paths refer to the same file (the goal of the original code) regardless of what the paths appear to be. It works on HFS+, ext, FAT, and NTFS file systems. For NTFS file systems, it does the right thing under Windows, where the volume is case-*in*sensitive, and on Mac/Linux where the volume is case-sensitive. And it works for hard and symbolic links on those file systems that support them.",

    "body": "@iSazonov  I don't think we can \"fix\" `Target`, at least for Unix. Short of walking the file system, like the UNIX `find` command does, I don't believe there is a way to discover all the hard links to a given inode. An inode has a _count_ of links that refer to it, but not a list of the actual links.\r\n\r\nMy low-level code does not attempt to find all paths to an inode, just whether two paths point to the same inode. There is an open request issue in corefx (dotnet/corefx#10120) to implement this in corefx.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 5.1 on my Windows 10 box, the `Target` property contains a collection of other hard links to the same file. On PowerShell for CoreCLR, `Target` is empty. The code for discovering the links on Windows is `#if`-ed out, with a comment saying the Windows API functions `FindFirstFileName` and `FindNextFileName` are not supported in CoreCLR. Is that no longer the case? I re-enabled that code, using the appropriate DLL name from [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/mt588480%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?#api-ms-win-core-file-l1-2-2.dll), and I'm able to populate `Target` on CoreCLR. That code, though, does have another instance of case-insensitive path comparison, which is what started this PR in the first place.\r\n\r\nI have come across a few other issues that are related to links, one in New-Item and two that directly affect #621 (the latter two are, I believe, corefx issues: see dotnet/corefx#17843 and dotnet/corefx#17844). Do we want to create a single issue as a catch-all for link-related items?",

    "body": "@iSazonov In response to your review:\r\n\r\n- `RequireAdminOnWindows`: I knew about this, but decided against it in this case.\r\n  - Whether a test requires elevation on Windows is not about the test itself, but about the _precondition_ for the test---the _test_ can run without elevation, but it requires elevation (on Windows) to create the symbolic links the test works with.\r\n  - Using this tag would mean that we would need a separate `Describe` for almost every test, in some cases with the tests duplicated only because we couldn't do part of the setup without elevation. If I understand this tag correctly, this would also require creating identical tests that do no have this tag so they can be run on Unix, and possibly coming up with a mechanism for ensuring that only one of those tests is run. This seems to me to be a lot of extra code for little gain. Since all these tests are validating the same basic thing, I thought they should be contained in a single `Describe.`\r\n- Using `It \"\" -TestCase $testCases`: If we end up having multiple `Describe` blocks as discussed above, using the `$testCases` might not be practical since we'd probably end up with the logic contained within the `It` block in each `Describe` block.\r\n- `Remove-Item` after the `ShouldBe`: You're right about that, of course. However, we can't move the `Remove-Item $destination` into the `AfterAll` block because most of the time the source and the destination object are the same object and removing it would likely cause the next test to fail because its source object no longer exists. I can, though, do something like this:\r\n```\r\n$pathExists = Test-Path $testCase.Destaination\r\nRemove-Item -Path $testCase.Destination -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\r\n$pathExists | Should Be $true\r\n```\r\n- Native code: For consistency I modeled the coding style of the existing `isdirectory.h` and `isdirectory.cpp` files. I'm happy to make your suggested changes if you prefer.",
