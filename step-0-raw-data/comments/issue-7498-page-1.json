What matters is whether the `-Name` argument is designed to uniquely identify an existing entity using a literal (non-wildcard) name.\r\n\r\nAs such, @SteveL-MSFT, you're right that the case of `Get-Module` is _ambiguous_:\r\n\r\n* (a) On the one hand, you could argue that its `-Name` argument  identifies _multiple entities_, if you conceive of the _versions_ of a given module as _distinct entities in their own right_.\r\n\r\n* (b) On the other hand, you can conceive of a module with a given name to be an _abstract, yet distinct_ entity, and conceive of its _versions_ as its _specific incarnations_.\r\n\r\n* (c) As an aside: Even the unambiguous case of asking for an _exact module version_ via the `RequiredVersion` key of a hashtable representing a fully qualified module module  passed `-FullyQualifiedModuleName` currently quietly returns nothing if the specific version is not found - something that should also be fixed.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe (a) interpretation is at odds with the parameter name: if the argument is really a _filter_, it shouldn't be named `-Name`, since in most cmdlets `-Name` unambiguously identifies a specific, existing entity.\r\n\r\nViewed through the lens of (b), `-Name`  can still be thought of unambiguously identifying the module _in the abstract_, irrespective of which and how many of its versions are loaded.  \r\n\r\nPerhaps needless to say, (b) makes more sense to me in the grand scheme of things (leaving backward compatibility aside).\r\n\r\nOverall, separating the aspects of _retrieving_  items from [_testing their existence_](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/7434#issuecomment-413637383) is indeed the way to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

It is a combination function: we use it to test, and we use it to get -- but most people use it to test. \r\n\r\nA decade worth of code has been written based on this _expected_ behavior. In fact, he _get_ functionality isn't what people usually care about. [Search _just on GitHub_ for `if(Get-Module` and you'll find over 148,000 results](https://github.com/search?l=PowerShell&q=if+Get-Module&type=Code). Compare that to a [search for just `Get-Module`](https://github.com/search?l=PowerShell&q=Get-Module&type=Code) and there's only about 2,000 more. \r\n\r\nAs a result, any attempt to \"correct\" this will be annoying to **all** current users, in addition to being a breaking change for compatibility with Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nIf we start producing errors from core commands where there have been none before, the experience for users is going to be a lot like a disaster: broken scripts and modules everywhere -- things that used to work, but don't work anymore (and nobody understands why, because they didn't write this).\r\n\r\nWriting `Test` commands doesn't solve the problem of breaking the existing command -- changing the command requires rewriting hundreds of thousands of lines of code, and the `Test` command simply won't be available on Windows PowerShell.",

If we assume that 10% of the people writing PowerShell scripts and modules are using Github (a very high %, I'd be surprised if the number using any source control at all is around that % nevermind using github) then that's at 1.48 million scripts that will break with this change. Or to put it another way, that's 1.48 million scripts that need to be rewritten before they can be used on PS v6+.\r\n\r\nThis change may only produce a non-terminating error but how many script writers know that there are even non-terminating errors? How many people using scripts written by others are likely to know? I'd imagine most of them will see red text and assume a big problem has occurred, because for the vast majority of users there is no difference between the error types. \r\n\r\nPersonally I don't want to have to rewrite all of my scripts to have `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` on every non-wildcard `Get-Module` call (or wrap them in try/catch with `-ea stop` to make sure it's just a module not found exception). I've only got a few hundred scripts that I'd need to change but that's still a good week of effort to rewrite them and at least that much time again to test them all (a lot written before I started using Pester).\r\n\r\nI'd also definitely argue against it being a Bucket 3 change, this is at least a Bucket 2 change or higher. This has been documented by a variety of blog posts and a lot of code samples all over the internet, including \"official\" Microsoft sources like Hey Scripting Guy linked above, it just might not be officially documented and that's a very easy fix to make.

If this pattern is adopted en mass, users will be forced to redo large sections of code to accommodate where `Get-` commands currently return nothing when nothing is found but do produce errors whenever other conditions occur (such as the queried service being unavailable). Where before the presence of an error indicated a failure and no results indicated not found, now the user must do error inspection. This pattern will result in error message scraping because many authors don't make error generation easy to consume.. because error generation in PowerShell is neither intuitive nor easy.\r\n\r\nDoes adding a ton of `test-` commands fix that? well, somewhat. But now I need more code to do the same thing I have been doing for yeas and I need to make massive adjustments to my existing Windows PowerShell code to make it work with core. If I'm a small shop, this would just add another reason to not move to core and stay on Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nWas the original design wrong? Maybe. But it has resulted in a unique-to-PowerShell shortcut that has been widely used as a best practice recommendation. The current behavior doesn't break anything. It doesn't stand in the way of progress. The new behavior, if adopted from the start, would have built a body of work and recommendations that would have maintained it. However, now a decade of examples, text books, blog posts, help documents, course materials, etc are all seeds of confusion and frustration for new users who come in to this after the behavior is changed.\r\n\r\nWhat does changing this behavior solve and at what cost?",

The behavior (for example) of `Get-Module -Name $ModuleName` should not change based which characters are present in the value of $ModuleName. And the appropriate behavior in the case of a null result is to return a null result.\r\n3. While there may be exceptions, this is the preferred behavior for almost all future Get commands, as well. What makes PowerShell great to work with is how simple it is to do simple things. Dynamic type conversion makes working with nulls trivial. Forcing us to add unnecessary complexity to our code in order to handle unnecessary errors with no value added is unnecessary and serves no purpose.",

    "body": "I can only fully speak for myself, but AFAIK, no one on the @PowerShell/powershell-committee was ever proposing that we change `Get-Module`. We were just using it as a foil to `Get-FormatData`/`Get-TestData` to create a more thougtful rationale around the issue of returning (or not returning) a non-terminating error in the `Get-SpecificThing foo` case. \r\n\r\nSo yes, to be very explicit: I am not in favor of changing `Get-Module`. \r\n\r\nThat being said, my rationale is slightly different than most of what I'm seeing in this thread.\r\n\r\nSometimes, Really Important Things™ get to break consistency with all the other stuff in a language. This might be because it's hard to maintain consistency all the way to your basest of cases, but often it's because these Really Important Things have to be built (and left untouched) very early on in the development of a language, before standard patterns and practices are well defined. Very rarely does it make sense to change Really Important Things, even if you have new standards of consistency going forward.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of breaking changes decisions we've made thus far, there are two competing forces at play:\r\n  - The benefit that a breaking change would bring to the ecosystem\r\n  - The negative impact of making that change, including the *scope* or *volume* of scripts/users impacted, and the *amount of work* required by users to address that impact\r\n\r\nOne example of a Very Important Thing is our `return` semantics. For better or for worse (and let's please not have this conversation here, it's just an example 😊), PowerShell returns everything written to the pipeline. We could never change this. The benefit is, I'll say, debatable at best, and the negative impact would be *huge* and difficult to correct. *But*, we didn't carry that baggage forward into PowerShell classes. And given that more dev-y users are likely to be the ones utilizing PowerShell classes, there was benefit to breaking consistency with the old thing and having more traditional return semantics. \r\n\r\nWhat we *did* say on the call is that we want to revert the original `Get-FormatData` change in 6.1 so that we can fully enumerate other cmdlets that we *might* want to change (e.g. `Get-TypeData`) all at once in 6.2. \r\n\r\nBut we're still going to do an assessment of which ones we should change, and `Get-Module` doesn't pass muster for me. (`Get-TypeData` probably *does* given it's lower usage, though...)",
