    "body": "Hi @jporkka - thanks for reporting this.  The reason this occurs is because the web service hosting the help content is case sensitive.  While PowerShell and the cmdlets are case insensitive, outside services (such as the hosting system for help) may have different criteria. The module name that you type is built as part of the url that the web service uses to locate the help content. If the module name is not typed in the proper case, then failures may occur.   \r\n\r\nThis is documented here for additional reference in the last two paragraphs.\r\n* https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_case-sensitivity?view=powershell-7.3\r\n* \n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo-powershell-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_case-sensitivity\">about Case-Sensitivity - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>This article explains how PowerShell handles case-sensitivity.</div></blockquote>",
