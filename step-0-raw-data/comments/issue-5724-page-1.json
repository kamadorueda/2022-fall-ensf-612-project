    "body": "Just noting, the reasoning for this seems that because ':' is not allowed in the name part of the label, using it on the 'break' or 'continue' statement is in affect not giving the statement any argument at all, and thus describes the behavior that is witnessed.   An error is what should be returned, because there was a token, but it was not valid in construct, but an error is not returned because the colon and the term behind it are immediately treated as a label for a further appearing loop, but cannot actually be accessed because its behind the 'break'/'continue' statement, so its just ignored.",
