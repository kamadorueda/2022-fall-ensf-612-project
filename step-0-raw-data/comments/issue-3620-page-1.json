I did the following test with the semaphore file present and then not present:\r\n`measure-command { 1..60 | %{ ./powershell.exe -c \"exit\" }`\r\nthe average difference was about +2ms per invocation when the semaphore file was present. I'm happy to use other methodologies, just let me know what you would like to see.",
