    "body": "When you hand a scriptblock to be converted to a delegate/callback for a .NET API, PowerShell has zero control of exactly how that scriptblock/callback gets invoked. \r\n\r\nSo, if the .NET API invokes it on a different thread, one without a default runspace, it will fail. There's really not much PowerShell can do about that without re-designing significant portions of the PS engine. \r\n\r\n/cc @SeeminglyScience @daxian-dbw did something in this .NET API change for .NET Core and made its use in PowerShell less stable, perhaps? It did seem to work fairly well for PowerShell 5.1. ðŸ¤” ",
