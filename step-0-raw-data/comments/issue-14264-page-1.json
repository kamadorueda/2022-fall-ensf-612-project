I think if you had an int64 or int32 in PS5 and sent them to json and got them back they became int32 and a  `1` is an int32 by default and \"a\" is a string by default. \r\n\r\nNow they come back as int64 - I suspect to avoid a test to say \"Does this need to be an int64 ?\"   This may be something inherited from .net but _anything_ which assumes `1` read from a json file being the same kind of `1` as the `1` in `$x = 1`  - which tbh is a pretty easy assumption to make - is going to hit trouble. \r\nBy the same logic we don't want a json converter seeing \"y\" and converting it to a char instead of a string,.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

For a typed property the deserializer knows to convert the Int64 to a Int32 but because your property is untyped you are getting an Int64.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
