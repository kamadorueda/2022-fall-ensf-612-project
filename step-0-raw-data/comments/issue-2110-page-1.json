That module adds some extra functionality to `Get-Credential`.\n\n``` powershell\nGet-Credential UserName -Store\n```\n\n> If you haven't stored the password for \"UserName\", you'll be prompted with the regular PowerShell credential prompt, otherwise it will read the stored password.\n> In either case, it will store (update) the credentials in the Vault \n\nPerhaps that type of behavior should be added to the native `Get-Credential` cmdlet.\n",
