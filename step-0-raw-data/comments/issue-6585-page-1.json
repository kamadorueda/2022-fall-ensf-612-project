    "body": "@ffeldhaus  Can you provide some concrete examples of how you think this should look?  Also some things to think through...\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between inheriting from a class and inheriting from a command: type inheritance is done statically at compile time (even with PowerShell classes). Command inheritance would have to be done dynamically (i.e. at run time) so that implies dynamic parameters. In fact, using the existing dynamic parameter mechanism, you can (somewhat awkwardly) do this today. Take a look at this comment from @jleechpe  on a semi-related question from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49657984/how-to-call-a-powershell-function-from-a-variable/49658577?noredirect=1#comment86334665_49658577) . The question is about mocking specifically but the code takes a function to mock and generates dynamic parameters based on the mocked function's parameters. This mechanism could be built into the runtime itself fairly easily. Note that this approach has two caveats: it will be slow relative to a straight function dispatch and it may be nondeterministic - the command you think you're inheriting from might not be the one the runtime finds. \r\n\r\nAn alternate approach that could resolve everything at compile time would be to have the command \"inherit\" from a class. What do you think about this approach?\r\n\r\nFinally, what happens when there are the `begin`, `process` and `end` blocks in the base function. How do you see these being handled? Are they automatically called then the derived functions equivalent is called. Consider the case where the `begin` in the base function does some complex initialization with the parameters.",

    "body": "I think @ffeldhaus wants it in the case where you’re building a set of functions to access API calls. Since the parameters would mostly be the same being able to inherit would save code duplication (especially if changes needed to be made). I don’t think it’s a matter of calling the inherited function, just having it’s parameters made available (or at least I would have a use for it that way).\r\n\r\nIn my case it was for reports where I needed a set of criteria filters (first for an sql query and later for lists of machines) where the parameters were for different groups of devices or time spans.  I ended up needing the filter functions for multiple reports and was building out the functions for users who needed the actual call to be as simple as possible.\r\n\r\nI had to recreate the parameters in each report (and then update them every time the sets of criteria were changed because of additional use cases), so I ended up using the dynamic parameters so I didn’t need to remember to update the 5+ primary functions (type of report + criteria) every time the business wanted a new criteria option.  Having a way to have a function inherit parameters and parameter sets natively would simplify the process.\r\n\r\nThe actual calls to the filter functions were as pipelines in the management function so the `begin` and `end` blocks processed fine.",

Well, could something like this be workable in terms of syntax?\r\n```\r\nparam(\r\n    [Parameter(ParentFunction = \"Get-ChildItem\")]\r\n    $Path\r\n)\r\n```\r\nOne way or another, you'd still have to specify the parameter name, but this would allow you to 'borrow' the validation checks and any other attributes the parameter has in that function. I have very little idea of how parameter attributes actually work behind the scenes, but essentially PS should look at that attribute, go \"OK, let's check `Get-ChildItem` for this parameter\", take all its metadata from that function and apply it to the parameter here.\r\n\r\nOne concern I have with this type of 'inheritance' is that by design it can potentially obscure what the requirements of the parameter are. A potential method of mitigating that confusion is that the help for that parameter cannot be specified by the function; it is referenced and pulled from the parent function instead.",

    "body": "Just to add to the mix here, there's also the pain point when you derive from a cmdlet base class that has parameters with parametersets defined. Sometimes you want to add new parameters to the base sets in the derived class (or include base parameters in the derived sets), and you can't do this without overriding/shadowing the `[Parameter]` decorated properties and redefining a new parameterattribute. It would be nice to be able to do this more succinctly.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// override base parameter LiteralPath to use position 1 and include in this parameter set\r\n[Parameter(Include=nameof(base.LiteralPath), Position=1, ParameterSetName='NewParamSet')]\r\n[Parameter(Position=0, Mandatory=true, ParameterSetName='NewParamSet')]\r\npublic string NewParam1 { get; set; }\r\n```\r\nThis could be implemented without having to rewire the entire engine by creating a `CustomReflectionContext` to surface an additional synthetic `ParameterAttribute` to the base property when the engine is discovering parameters. Worst case you'd have to scan the assembly once for this new `[Parameter(Include=...)]` directive, then create the context and scan again.\r\n\r\nThoughts, @lzybkr  ?",
