It isn't about telling you what you can/cannot use for variable/function/alias names. It is about ensuring there is some expectation of order though, so that you don't run into obscure bugs or unexpected behavior that show up when you use names that are not expected. Such \"restrictions\" would help the scripter, not just in their use of PowerShell, but in being a scripter/developer in general.\r\n\r\nOn the flip side, if we don't do this, do we have tests in place for such things (variable/function/alias names that are whitespace only or that start and/or end with whitespace), so that the scripter can reasonably expect them to work just fine? I'd wager that we don't, and I think it would be better to guide PowerShell scripter here in the right direction than to spend time testing/fixing the engine so that it properly supports such things throughout the language.\r\n\r\nA few well-intentioned limits here would be a good thing in my book.",

    "body": "Here's another example that came up in an email list today, where appropriate boundaries are not in place and what may appear as strange bugs show up as a result:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# You can define a function with a parameter name that is numeric.\r\n# This should not be allowed.\r\nfunction Test-ParameterName {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param([Switch]$7)\r\n    # The body doesn't matter\r\n}\r\n\r\n# You can define a function with a parameter alias that is numeric.\r\nfunction Test-ParameterAlias {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param([Alias('7')][Switch]$NumericAliasTest)\r\n    # The body doesn't matter\r\n}\r\n\r\n# You can't invoke either of these function with a parameter name or\r\n# alias that is numeric.\r\n# Strange bugs show up when you don't put appropriate boundaries\r\n# in place around command/variable/etc. names\r\nTest-ParameterName -7 # Returns an error\r\nTest-ParameterAlias -7 # Returns an error\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, we should have rules for parameter names and parameter aliases. For example, if they start with a number, they must contain at least one alphabetic character. But even then, there are other considerations that need to be taken into account, like this one:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-ParameterName {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param([Switch]$10mb)\r\n    # The body doesn't matter\r\n}\r\n\r\n# You can't invoke this with the parameter either because the name is\r\n# still numeric, even though it contains alphabetic characters.\r\nTest-ParameterName -10mb # Returns an error\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think we should support parameter names that are numeric, so that a command could have a parameter name such as `-32bit`, for example, but more consideration should be given to the many different types of numeric constants that can be used that contain alphabetic characters (e.g. `-1gb`, `-1d`, `-1e10`, `-0xabcd`, etc). In the case where a parameter name or a parameter alias starts with one or more numbers, maybe the parser should prevent any scenarios that represent static numbers. They aren't likely to come up as desirable parameter names anyway, perhaps with the exception of `-0xbadf00d`...😛\r\n",
