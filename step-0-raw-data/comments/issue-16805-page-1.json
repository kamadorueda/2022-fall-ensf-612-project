    "body": "Pasting a secret from the clipboard is a requirement in many places, API keys are often impractical to type because it is assumed they will be pasted - they are also too long and random for most people to commit to memory. Azure Devops creates  API keys of >50 characters and typically they need to be copied from a web page, pasted, and saved in some secure-at-rest form (secure string fills this role nicely).  \r\nThe advice that secrets should not be in memory as clear text is all very fine and good but if something is capable of being copied to the clipboard, having the user read it in one window and type it and type it another still has a clear version in memory but adds exposure to key loggers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
