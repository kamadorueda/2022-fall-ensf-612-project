    "body": "The administrator restriction is on the remoting (WinRM) endpoint for security and is set by default.  It is possible to remove the admin constraint from the endpoint but not advisable.  It is interesting that the credentials used to log onto the remote machines work, but fail for the local machine case.  `Start-Job` does not connect to a WinRM endpoint like `Invoke-Command`, and instead connects to a local child process with the same user account as the parent process, so there are no security concerns as with WinRM endpoints which can accept off-box connections.\r\n\r\nI am not sure it is worth adding the ability to create a local job to `Invoke-Command -AsJob`.  It seems better to create a helper function that makes the decision to start an off-box WinRM job connection or a local job connection.",
