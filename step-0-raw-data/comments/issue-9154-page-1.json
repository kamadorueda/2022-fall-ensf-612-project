    "body": "Why does specifying a trailing `.0` force a number which can be represented as a [decimal] to be represented as a much less capable [double]?   The trailing zero has no value in the representation of the number, either in resolution or scale, only certainty, and neither double nor decimal have provision for certainty (at least not of the decimal portion).  In other words, the error is wrong, the value is not too large for a [decimal].  However, after its converted to [double], the loss of precision results in a rounding up, so later when it tries to implicitly convert it to a higher precision type ([decimal]) the number is just now too big).\r\n\r\nI think conversions are always towards the type that has the highest precision (which is almost always the type that takes more space), not the type that is either left or right.",
