    "body": "> tcsh\r\n\r\nThat's not a POSIX-compliant shell. We should be able to execute POSIX shell script from any POSIX-compliant shell; that's the definition of POSIX-compliant. The scripts and paths should be written for any /bin/sh to execute them, and our choice of implementation doesn't matter.\r\n\r\nThe issue is that dash is the default /bin/sh on some platforms and doesn't like the way paths are passed, while bash and zsh have no problem with it.\r\n\r\n`zsh` is guaranteed on supported macOS versions, so that's ok. But on Linux we just don't know. However, `bash` is so very common that (1) it's what people actually write their scripts for when they mean to target /bin/sh and (2) it's probably worth looking for.\r\n\r\nI agree that I don't like looking for another file at startup, but (1) it's only on Linux when `-Login` is used and (2) it's probably not actually that expensive. It's also very simple.\r\n\r\n> catch error and call bash as last resort - I think it is best way.\r\n\r\nWhat do we catch though? We're p/Invoking into a syscall, so there's no exception. Theoretically it returns an error code, except it's `exec` so when you call it your whole process gets paved over. We successfully start the new program, but it's taken over our process, so when it fails later it's not the `exec` call that fails, it's our initial `pwsh` process.\r\n\r\nThe only solution to that is making the `/bin/sh` login/exec script failsafe, but then we need to pass the failure information into pwsh in the exec call and use it to tell ourselves to start bash. That's now a third CLR startup, which involves plenty of file reads as assemblies are loaded into memory... So I think testing for bash is going to be faster.",
