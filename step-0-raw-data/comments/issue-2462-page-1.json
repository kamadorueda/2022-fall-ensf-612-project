    "body": "@iSazonov Ok, you're right, there are some sorts that can't be done without a -Bottom parameter, and for those cases with my proposal you would have to use Select-Object to get those results.\n\nThe question I need to ask before I would add -Bottom to this enhancement as well is: does it matter?\n\nI don't think it does, which I think is why I felt -Top N covered all of the use cases. In Select-Object, -First and -Last are both needed and there are use cases for both parameters (e.g. $path -split '\\' | select -last 2). In sorted data, there isn't really such a need. I believe that's why in modern SQL servers, they don't have a bottom N command. Instead they suggest using a top N -Descending sort (e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1876606/how-to-select-bottom-most-rows).\n\nFurther, adding -Bottom would require an additional parameter set in Sort-Object, which is trivial to implement but adds complexity that should be avoided unless it's really necessary. I don't believe it should be added just for completeness if the recommendation for people looking for bottom N would most likely be to use -Top N -Descending instead. If someone can demonstrate a real-world use case where -Bottom N would be useful in PowerShell, then I'll happily include it here. I don't think there is such a use case, but feel free to prove me wrong.\n",

    "body": "I see pros and cons in both approaches\n\n### Why `-Bottom`\n- Symmetry as @iSazonov pointed out. I like it too.\n- In my opinion, the main use-case for `-Top` is not to avoid one extra `| Select-Object -First`, but to avoid the performance cost that is associated with piping a big amount of objects. Hence introducing more piping in the `-Bottom` case compare to `-Top` case is undesirable and `-Bottom` should be it's own parameter\n- `Sort -Top 10 -Descending | Sort` (or equivalent) is kind of ugly and hard to read. Maybe if we introduce a `Reverse-Object` at the same time as one of the core cmdlets, it would be fine.\n\n### Why not `-Bottom`\n- These parameters are mutually exclusive and adding both of them multiplies the parameter sets count by 2. In this case, I think it's acceptable. There is only 1 parameter set currently.\n- Introducing `-Bottom` will make parameter sets asymmetrical: there should be an optional named parameter `Top` and mandatory named parameter `Bottom` in non-default parameter set. Asymmetry!\n\n### Summary\n\nI'm almost ambivalent with a slight preference toward including `-Bottom` or not adding it, but adding `Reverse-Object` at the same time.\n",
