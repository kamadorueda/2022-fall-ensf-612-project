    "body": "@PowerShell/powershell-committee had a long discussion on this: a couple of us are ambivalent, and a couple feel like \"canonicalizing\" these aliases might encourage their usage in scripts (prompting the need to write a PSSA rule that no one wants to write).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, no one expects any new keys to be added to this syntax in the future. (Though, personally, I might feel differently if you were planning on adding a host of new keys soon.)\r\n\r\nAnother possible option would be to add support for tab completion inside of the expression syntax, and everyone agrees that this would solve the meta problem of wanting to be relatively pithy on the command line, even if single-letter collisions occur after the addition of new keys.",

    "body": "Thanks for the feedback, @joeyaiello.\r\n\r\n> a couple feel like \"canonicalizing\" these aliases might encourage their usage in scripts\r\n\r\nWell, **\"canonicalizing\" these aliases was the primary motivation for this PR**: the intent was to _future-proof_ the existing practice of using just `n` / `l` and `e` in scripts, based on a preponderance of such usage online.\r\n\r\nDoing so **follows the existing practice of providing parameter aliases** such as `-h` for `-Hidden` in `Get-ChildItem` and the recently introduced (disclaimer: suggested by yours truly) `-lp` for `-LiteralPath`; similarly, the CLI offers [`-c` as an alias for `-command`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/52546f57f2da1fa12d348746a107328d8edd671c/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/CommandLineParameterParser.cs#L776), ... \r\n\r\nAs an aside: Regrettably, these aliases are _undocumented_.\r\n\r\nOn a related note: it's worth entertaining a simpler syntax for calculated properties - see #8107\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLeaving the alias aspect aside, **this PR offered a worthwhile consolidation of all calculated-property keys in a single place, across all cmdlets**.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
