I was just hoping that it would be easier (and therefore much more likely to get done) if Microsoft could issue a Windows PowerShell 5.1 **patch** to add this stuff.  I figured if Microsoft had to recompile and issue a new WMF 5.2, that would take a long time to happen.  :-)",

Anyway, the above scenario works without having to run `Add-Type -Path <path>\\netstandard.dll`.  \r\n\r\nI'll be submitting a PR tonight for a doc page on a command-line version of creating a simple, portable binary module.  Of course, the proviso is that you have to have .NET 4.7.1 installed or be on Windows 10 FCU or higher.  I think this can live side-by-side with the PR for a version that uses Visual Studio. Certainly folks that are on Linux, won't be able to use Visual Studio.  Later we can put up a page that shows how to do this with Visual Studio Code on Linux/macOS.",
