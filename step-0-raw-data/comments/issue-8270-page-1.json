Think about matching either an opening or closing XML tag, those lines should be added either to current or new batch. For most control, you could return an enum with values like:\r\n\r\n* `'Continue'` - add item to current batch\r\n* `'Skip'` - discard item, start new batch\r\n* `'First'` - start new batch, then add item to it\r\n* `'Last'` - add item to current batch, then start new one\r\n\r\nwith true/false translating to some of them, first two sound reasonable to replicate behavior of splitting string.

If it's an array, then you can't really implement what you suggest without breaking cmdlets that yield arrays, as it is not possible to distinguish them from chunks/batches. While things like arrays of arrays might be confusing to some, I think it's the only consistent way to do things without adding sharp corner cases, similar to existing cmdlets like `Get-ChildItem` unwrapping single results.\r\n\r\nI also think that \"arrays of arrays\" being confusing is caused by how PowerShell displays objects by default, hiding the containers, so that you can't e.g. distinguish a dict from a `PSCustomObject` from an array of key-value pairs. That's why we often use `ConvertTo/From-Json` when discussing containers, to show them exactly. I wonder if adding `Format-Debug` similar to Python's `repr` would help. ",

For `Set-Content` it offers a performance gain  so something like \r\n`Get-User | Select-object -Property Name -ReadCount 100 | Set-Content -File names`    \r\nWould mask a failing in `Set-Content`. But the real answer is to fix that (or for _any_ logic to include batching where that makes sense.).\r\nTBH \"Get-user\" is going to take most of the time that example takes to run, so even if we reduce the `Set-Content` time to zero we won't see orders of magnitude improvement    \r\nFor few users (e.g. if the command is really \"Get-LocalUser\") it doesn't matter.    \r\nFor many users, I can see the decision going from \"Can I send as one batch to help perf that I can see is/will be poor?\"  to a long process of what the size should be - if the command is really \"Get-AdUser\" and the directory is 128K users, do I divide into 2  64K chunks? or 64 2K chunks? Or 2K chunks of 64 each ?   And when the next person looks at the code they need to find out why chunks of 512 were chosen. Extra time writing and maintaining the code cancels out the saved run time  :-(    \r\n(see https://jhoneill.github.io/powershell/2019/11/10/Arrays-DontSweatSmallStuff.html) \r\n\r\n  \r\n@iRon7  it may be best to make this available as a community command.  (I'm on the cmdlet working group, and I can't speak for everyone else, but I'd predict this would get a response of \"Good idea, better done by the community\").  Despite the limits of where it is useful, where it does have value it probably has _a lot_ of value. \r\nNote that in V2 you've broken this form `Create-Batch -Size 10  (1..60)`   - you can also have \"a -NoUnroll\" option to batch to arrays of arrays. \r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"/assets/james.jpg\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://jhoneill.github.io/powershell/2019/11/10/Arrays-DontSweatSmallStuff.html\">PowerShell Arrays, performance and [not] sweating the small stuff.</a></strong></div><div>PowerShell (or PWSH if you prefer).
