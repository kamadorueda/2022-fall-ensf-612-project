    "body": "Good questions. No, I'm not sure but it's my suspicion. I also don't have a $PROFILE.\r\n\r\nI just tried this on two other servers (let's call them B & C) without an Internet connection but their behavior is inline with what we would expect. Before setting the opt-out variables, they both contacted aka.ms upon launching. After I added in the opt-out variables, they don't.\r\n\r\nNote this attempt to connect \"aka.ms\" on servers B & C is different from server A which is trying to connect to \"ctldl.windowsupdate.com\" and that may be the source of the problem.\r\n\r\nI don't know how or why they're different â€“ except I created B & C from scratch whereas A was created by another SA. I wonder if they're setting up Windows Update differently and maybe that bypasses the PWSH update check?",
