There's also an MSIX package for installing through the Windows Store (and the [appx module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/appx/?view=win10-ps))\r\n\r\n>  Uninstall-Application should remove them, much like Settings > Apps & features does.\r\n\r\nThis (something to manage applications registered in the Apps & Features panel) seems like a reasonable idea for a module as well.

(.exe, .msi, etc.)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if you're actually talking about package management here (if you were, you can ignore this).\r\n\r\nTaking this at face value to mean you're asking for a cmdlet that you can point to a setup executable and have it figure out how to silently install it. That is unfortunately not feasible.  There are *many* different setup creation suites that all act pretty differently from each other.  Even if you can figure out which framework was used, there's still a few issues:\r\n\r\n1. If the framework includes global silent parameters, the setup creator can simply ignore them\r\n1. The setup could require additional product specific parameters that are often impossible to detect reliably\r\n1. If the setup creator added extra GUI steps to the install wizard, they often appear event with silent install parameters specified\r\n\r\nThat even applies to MSI installers.  I've had MSI's with `CustomAction`'s that show an unskippable GUI, or that require a public property to be set.\r\n\r\nOn top of that there are plenty of setup executables that are entirely custom, some that just don't have silent install parameters, and some that purposefully make it difficult to deploy.\r\n\r\nYou may think \"well yeah it won't work with badly made installers\" but it's a much bigger percentage than you'd think.  Plus even just the \"simple\" version of figuring out which framework was used and what it's silent install parameters are would be a monumental undertaking.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, *someone* has to figure out how to make the thing install, usually through either reading documentation or trial and error (and why package management is more or less the answer).",
