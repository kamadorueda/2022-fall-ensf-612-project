    "body": "There are two options here:\n1. Self-host the PowerShell runtime by bundling System.Management.Automation and its dependencies with the PowerShell Editor Services host application.\n2. Don't self-host the PowerShell runtime but build against the reference assemblies.  Require that the PowerShell Core be installed somewhere on the user's machine and dynamically load up the assemblies at runtime.\n\nOption 1 definitely requires NuGet packages.  Option 2 requires that I'm able to dynamically load up SMA.dll which seems possible with the AssemblyLoadContext (am I right about that?).  It seems we're moving toward a common installation path for PowerShell on all platforms, so I suppose this might work.\n\nWhat do you think?  Is option 2 viable?  I could try it against a recent drop of PowerShell if you think it could work.\n",
