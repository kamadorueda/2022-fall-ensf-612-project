    "body": "So, at least on Ubuntu 16.04, here are the listed depends that are categorized as \"required\":\n- libc6\n- libgcc1\n- libtinfo5\n- libuuid1\n- zlib1g\n\nOn the one hand, these are required in the sense that .NET Core listed them as dependencies, and Ubuntu also requires them for a base system, so there is no harm in specifying them (they're already going to be installed, and PowerShell wouldn't work without them); but it's also redundant.\n\nMy _personal opinion right now_ is to keep them as dependencies. I see no reason not to except to clean things up slightly (but that clean up would be technically incorrect).\n\nSimilarly, the packages\n- libcurl3\n- libssl1.0.0\n\nare not _required_ in the sense that PowerShell would crash without them. They are necessary for practically anything use the web cmdlets (and we have issues filed due to libcurl not being installed). Perhaps these belong in recommends or suggests instead of depends, I'm not sure. I don't see major harm in depending on them (someone, somewhere, might complain we installed something unnecessarily for their use case, maybe).\n",
