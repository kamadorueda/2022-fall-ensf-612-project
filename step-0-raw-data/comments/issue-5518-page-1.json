The class can access its own members regardless of what file they are in.  Private and internal would affect how the rest of the assembly accesses the class. I can look into it after the next set of cleanup PRs, but I don't think there will be any changes.",

We need at least two review to eliminate the risk of typos. We don't cover all the options with tests to fully trust them.\r\n\r\nI think your plan is good, if we're going to remove by one class. \r\n\r\nAnd yes - we're very slow. This is not only a problem of this open project. I guess it's a headache for the team. I don't know how to solve it, but we definitely have to do it if we want to use the resources of Komuniti to grow fast. /cc @joeyaiello @SteveL-MSFT ",

    "body": "If I'm doing a lift and shift, is there a need to look for typos? Especially if there is a cleanup action to follow? \r\n\r\nI understand some of the slowness and I'm aware of how rough this is for both us and the PS Team. I don't work in development or even close to it, so much of the entire process is new to me anyway. I'm not too concerned about that.  My concern is how to use my time. The reason I mentioned this one being slow is because it is somewhat blocking to other things I could be doing. But if this will block for too long, I can just do those things now since I have time and save this for when I need a breather or don't have time. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure of your situation, but for mine my work doesn't exactly me provide me time to spend on this project. I fit PowerShell work in the tiny gaps I have at work and then use much of my own time outside of work. \r\n\r\nThe minor improvement would be at least some communication on when certain PRs will take longer. That is some of my own inexperience in not knowing what is easier or harder to review and lack of familiarity with development processes. But that is also a problem when I have PRs that are sitting with passing tests and all comments addressed for long periods of time with no clue why. I don't want to bug or rush anyone, but I also don't want my PRs to fall through the cracks and be forgotten. Some back and forth communication in that regard would go a long way.\r\n\r\nI will close this PR and break up the work. ",
