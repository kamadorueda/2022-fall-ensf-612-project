In my case, I found that invoking synchronized profile from `$PROFILE` works better, so that I can still have machine-specific code, e.g. setting up proxy on my work machine. Symlinking also can have surprising behavior when using relative paths - if you invoke a script via symlink, is `$PSScriptRoot` the folder of the link, or its target? What if you symlink entire folder?\r\n\r\nBut yeah, symlinks are a decent general solution as they can be used for entire directories regardless of contents, like ssh config, or config of whatever terminal you use.",
