To at least, in the MSI installation, make the new framework the links available. This way, people may want to install additional components. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I think this will help minimize the impact to our customers when installing PowerShell and using our products.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n",

But it doesn't host PowerShell, but instead parasitises it; loads itself into the PowerShell on the machine and takes over. So basically PSES lets users/PowerShell do the heavy lifting for the platform and is modular to that. You might expect there to be some issues from older PowerShell versions with outdated runtimes, but as @TylerLeonhardt says, I don't recall seeing anything like that.",
