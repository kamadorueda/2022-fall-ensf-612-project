    "body": "There was indeed a change in behavior between Windows PowerShell and PowerShell (Core), in support of cross-platform consistency, so I don't think it's a regression (though I cannot speak to what extent there was awareness that the behaviors diverged as a result).\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell (Core)-internal change between 7.0.5 and 7.1 is owed to a change in .NET itself outside PowerShell's control (presumably, just moving to a new .NET version did it - I have no information on what prompted the change in .NET).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Reports \"! . _\" in 7.0.5 vs. \"_ ! .\" in 7.1 and later on a US-English machine.\r\n[string[]] $a = '!', '_', '.'; [Array]::Sort($a, [StringComparer]::CurrentCultureIgnoreCase); $a -join ' '\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, even 7.05 didn't sort the same as `cmd.exe` with respect to non-ASCII characters:\r\n\r\nIt is also important to note that there is _no_ consistent behavior across the other shells and GUI file managers such as File Explorer.\r\n\r\nThe summary is:\r\n\r\n* Each platform individually exhibits different behaviors in the (native-shell) terminal vs. in the GUI file manager (notably, natural sorting of trailing numbers).\r\n\r\n* Different Unix-like platforms behave differently (macOS vs. Linux).\r\n\r\n* Windows PowerShell exhibits different behavior with `Get-ChildItem` (ordinal sorting (by code-point value), as reported by the .NET file-enumeration APIs) vs. with tab-completion (lexical) - an unfortunate inconsistency.\r\n\r\n* PowerShell (Core) now uses lexical sorting consistently, on all platforms, which means case-insensitive, current-culture-sensitive sorting; on Unix-like platforms it _must_ do its own sorting, because the underlying system APIs enumerate files unsorted.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI see the following options:\r\n\r\n* (a) Leave everything as is, which has two benefits:\r\n  * Simple implementation.\r\n  * Consistent behavior across all platforms - even if it doesn't match any platform's native sorting.\r\n\r\n* (b) Try to emulate the native shells _platform-specifically_, which would mean: \r\n  * Increased implementation complexity.\r\n  * Ordinal sorting on Windows and macOS.\r\n  * _Modified_ lexical sorting on Linux (emulating the specifics may be tricky, unless it is provided by a system call)\r\n\r\n* (c) Stick with consistent cross-platform behavior, but switch to the \"majority\" sorting, which would be ordinal, because 2 out of 3 platforms - Windows and macOS - use it, but in terms of actual PowerShell usage Linux is probably the more important platform.\r\n\r\nFrom a PowerShell (Core) perspective (alone), (b) and (c) would be breaking changes, given that a change wouldn't just affect the interactive experience (tab-completion) but also the order in which files are listed with `Get-Item` / `Get-ChildItem`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFor anyone who wants to experiment with the sort orders, here's test code:\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n```powershell\r\n& {\r\n  Push-Location ($td = New-Item -Force -ItemType Directory (Join-Path ([io.path]::GetTempPath()) $PID))\r\n\r\n  $names = 'foo', 'foo_bar.cmd', 'foo_bar_cmd', 'foo_bar!cmd', 'f√∂o', 'foo10', 'foo2'\r\n\r\n  $null = New-Item -Force $names\r\n\r\n  '-- Ordinal sort'\r\n  [Array]::Sort($names, [StringComparer]::OrdinalIgnoreCase); $names\r\n\r\n  '-- Lexical sort (current culture)'\r\n  [Array]::Sort($names, [StringComparer]::CurrentCultureIgnoreCase); $names\r\n\r\n  '-- Tab-completion'\r\n  (TabExpansion2 -inputScript 'Get-Item ' -cursorColumn 9).CompletionMatches.CompletionText\r\n\r\n  '-- Get-ChildItem' # also applies to -Path and -Filter wildcards\r\n  (Get-ChildItem).Name\r\n\r\n  if ($env:OS -eq 'Windows_NT') {\r\n    \"-- cmd /c dir (Windows)\"\r\n    cmd /c dir /b\r\n\r\n  } else {\r\n    \"-- ls ($(uname))\"\r\n    ls -1\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  Invoke-Item . # Show the folder in the platform's GUI file manager.\r\n\r\n  Read-Host '-- GUI File Manager launched; press Enter to clean up and exit; to test tab-completion in the native shell, press Ctrl-C now, and enter a native shell; rerun the script without aborting later to clean up'\r\n\r\n  Pop-Location; Remove-Item $td -Recurse\r\n}\r\n```\r\n</details>\r\n",
