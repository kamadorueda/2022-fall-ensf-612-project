    "body": "I've always thought that's how it should be: Verbose and Debug would behave the way they do in other developer logging tools like Log4net, as just different levels of logging.\r\n\r\nOn the downside (and why I've not filed this myself):\r\n1. If Verbose and Debug are **just** different logging levels, why bother with a breaking change (albeit one that surely doesn't break anything in automation). I mean, they're different \"streams\" but in practical usage, all that means is I can redirect them to separate files and/or turn one on without the other (i.e. **unlike** other logging tools, \"Debug\" wouldn't _imply_ \"Verbose\").\r\n2. We have the Information stream which we can use for even more interesting output filtering ...\r\n\r\nHaving said that, I basically agree that -Debug isn't useful and virtually nobody uses Write-Debug (I mean, anecdotally: I sometimes use it, and set `$DebugPreference = \"Continue\"`, but that never seems to swamp me with output the way you doing the same thing with Verbose does).",
