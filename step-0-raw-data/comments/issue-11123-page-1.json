If so, to satisfy my own curiosity, can you give me an example command that provokes such an error?\r\n\r\n- Exceptions thrown during prompt level pipeline creation, such as entering `[type]::psobject` directly into an interactive prompt.\r\n- Any other API that throws an `IContainsErrorRecord` exception in a circumstance where the engine the engine will not catch it (or will not specifically check for `IContainsErrorRecord`) and reform the record correctly\r\n\r\n`ParentContainsErrorRecordException` is the exception you're supposed to use when creating the error record stored by `IContainsErrorRecord.ErrorRecord`.\r\n\r\nHere's a basic example:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Management.Automation;\r\n\r\npublic class MyRuntimeException : Exception, IContainsErrorRecord\r\n{\r\n    private ErrorRecord _errorRecord;\r\n\r\n    public MyRuntimeException(string message) : base(message)\r\n    {\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ErrorRecord ErrorRecord => _errorRecord ??= new ErrorRecord(\r\n        new ParentContainsErrorRecordException(Message),\r\n        \"MySpecialErrorId\",\r\n        ErrorCategory.LimitsExceeded,\r\n        targetObject: null);\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Cmdlet(VerbsDiagnostic.Test, \"Exception\")]\r\npublic class TestExceptionCommand : PSCmdlet\r\n{\r\n    protected override void BeginProcessing()\r\n    {\r\n        throw new MyRuntimeException(\"My message!\");\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public static void ThrowMyException() => throw new MyRuntimeException(\"My message!\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you call `Test-Exception`, the error record will be correct.  If you call `ThrowMyException`, it'll instead be wrapped in a `MethodInvocationException`.  In the case of the latter, the details of the inner `ErrorRecord` are not duplicated.",

If it ever does I guess I'll have to find another example 😉\r\n\r\nIf you're curious, it fails because member binding expects that members with a reserved member name always exist, but it doesn't check if it's a static invocation.  So it sees `PSObject` and says \"oh I know that member, that's literally always there\" and then it tries to use it.\r\n\r\nOr... at least that's my guess. I can't remember if I actually looked at the code to see if I was right...\r\n \r\n> Using the intentional ordering of the properties will help, but I'm still concerned about the volume and structural complexity of the output.\r\n> \r\n> Do you see a way to algorithmically simplify the output in a manner that is more helpful to end users (hides implementation details) while avoiding omission of important information?\r\n\r\nMaybe you could keep a hash set of `ErrorId`'s and avoid recursing when there's a match?

Limiting MaxDepth to 1 would just be dumping $Error[0] to Format-List.  A MaxDepth of 2 or 3 is going to be most cases anyways as I haven't encountered any Exceptions/ErrorRecords that are more than 4 deep anyways.  The 10 was just a protective measure against infinite recursion.",
