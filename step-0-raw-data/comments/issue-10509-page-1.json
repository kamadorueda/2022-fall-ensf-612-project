    "body": "> Best practice is to avoid using literal paths and use path cmdlets.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov Yes and no.\r\n\r\nSure, if you are combining path segments, you can use path cmdlets. But if you are writing a script that references a relative path with multiple segments, and if you intend for your script to work cross platform, you're not going to do that.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 7 preview 3 on Windows, tab completion completes paths using a backslash. That is the one place where I think we're doing it wrong now that PowerShell is cross platform. There should at least be an option to select the directory separator character you want used on Windows as part of tab completion: either `[System.IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar` or `[System.IO.Path]::AltDirectorySeparatorChar`. Given where we are today, I suspect most folks who do any cross platform work would want tab completion of paths to use `AltDirectorySeparatorChar` on Windows by default, but as far as I know there is no way to make it do that.\r\n\r\n@chriskuech: Aside from tab completion of paths, are there other places where you feel `AltDirectorySeparatorChar` isn't being used where you would like to have an option for it to be used instead of `DirectorySeparatorChar`? I can't think of any.",

The use cases I was having an issue with were automatic variables and `*-Path` commands. \r\n\r\n@iSazonov, the proposed solution would not have worked for my scenario because I generated a list of paths on Windows, generated a list of paths on Linux, then attempted to compare them, which failed due to the separators. \r\n\r\nThe automatic variables consistently lack a trailing directory separator, so PowerShell beautifully allows creating paths with literals.  Ex:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$RepoRoot = \"$PSScriptRoot/../..\"\r\n$SourceRoot = \"$RepoRoot/src\"\r\n$BuildRoot = \"$RepoRoot/.build\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this is much more clear than\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$RepoRoot = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot \"../..\"\r\n$SourceRoot = Join-Path $RepoRoot \"src\"\r\n$BuildRoot = Join-Path $RepoRoot \".build\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nso I hope it can work in the future, even if not by default.",

It wasn't meant as a discussion thread, rather a feature request.\r\n\r\nThe root issue at hand: \r\n* Should a cross-platform tool have non-cross-platform behavior by default?\r\n* If so, should there be a way to globally run PowerShell in a \"cross-platform\" mode?\r\n\r\nI think forcing devs to manually normalize strings with cmdlets is a definite wrong move.  I don't see any scenarios where using `/` by default would cause issues on Windows because PowerShell, as previously mentioned, is very good about handling both kinds of slashes.  Unless anyone can provide compelling situations where this would cause error, why not just use `/` by default?  Perhaps this issue needs to move to an RFC.\r\n\r\nAs more people migrate to the cloud, more and more people develop PowerShell code on Windows and run it on Linux.  There will certainly be a point in the future (if not already passed) where the number of users preferring true cross-platform behavior exceeds any who feel strongly about keeping `\\` on Windows.",

But 90% or more of my time in issues is in open issues, as it should be.

That is a broken, flawed issue management strategy.\r\n\r\n> As for the issue, it turns into infinite - initial request was \"use forward slash on Windows\", then \"compare paths\". What is next?

It has remained focused on that topic. You're trying to make it sound like it isn't focused at all.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov, I agree that there are too many open issues; however, the fact that there are too many open issues does not mean we should be dismissive and shut conversation down prematurely on new issues. We must continue to encourage feedback and be open to discussion about PowerShell in open issues, and only close them once they are truly resolved.

Adding entries to the zip file with this API:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n    [System.IO.Compression.ZipFileExtensions]::CreateEntryFromFile(\r\n        $zip, $file, $entry,\r\n        [System.IO.Compression.CompressionLevel]::Optimal\r\n    ) > $null\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, $entry is a path within the zip archive. If I simply pass the windows path as returned by various path cmdlets, every zip utility on the planet will spew warnings about my zip file having the wrong slashes.\r\n\r\nAlso as a long time linux user and developer, I love powershell and I've been having lots of fun learning it. I've been having fun playing with my new windows server core over ssh into powershell 7 too, and I have published scripts that work perfectly with powershell on linux. I was surprised how well that works. In fact, powershell is going to be my first choice for some programs/scripts that I want to be cross-platform.\r\n\r\nBut it still makes me sad seeing all my tab completions be rewritten with backslashes.\r\n\r\nI use paths like /users/foo/somefile on windows all the time and that is what I want to use.\r\n\r\nMost of the windows APIs support forward slashes just fine. I realize there are a few exceptions, with utilities and maybe APIs, namely some cmd.exe invocations, but I just want to set something in my $profile so that by default all my paths have forward slashes, unless I am using backslashes explicitly.\r\n\r\nThis would be inoffensive to windows users and developers used to the backslashes because they would simply not use this setting, and it would default to off. Of course, they may decide to use it too if for example they decide to write cross-platform scripts and modules more.\r\n\r\nI want this setting for my scripts and modules too, so that I don't have unexpected problems like the one I showed above.",

    "body": "> But is this a PowerShell bug? \r\n\r\nWhile you could argue that on _Windows_ it is a WinAPI bug, given that `\\` and `/` are usually supported interchangeably, it is definitely a bug on Unix-like platforms if you do the reverse and pass a `\\` based path as the `-Target` path - on such platforms, only `/` is natively supported (it is only PowerShell that allows you to use `\\` as an alternative, which comes with its own problems - see #9244), and it is PowerShell's responsibility to translate something like `.\\TestScript.ps1` to `./TestScript.ps1` when creating the symlink.\r\n\r\nFixing this - by making PowerShell normalize the path to use the (primary) _platform-native_ separator - will also fix the issue on Windows.\r\n",

    "body": "I don't understand this whole thread -- but recent comments are particularly frustrating. When someone complains that an issue has been closed improperly, you can't then use the fact that it's been closed as an argument that the issue is wrong.\r\n\r\nLet's go back to basics, instead.\r\n\r\nI think what you really want is just to change Tab Complection. In that case, you should edit TabExpansion2. Perhaps you could accomplish what you want by iterating the return from `CompletInput` checking the `CompletionMatches` for `ResultType -in \"ProviderContainer\", \"ProviderItem\"` and then replacing the character in the `CompletionText` (and `ListItemText`, if you like). **THAT** would be safe, because it would only affect authoring, and not the execution of existing scripts.  If that's enough, we should have a conversation about changing _just_ TabExpansion2 _by default_. I think shipping a forward-slash version in a module would be enough, but I wouldn't fight too hard against changing it.\r\n\r\nBut some explanation for why I think the broader default is a bad idea: the **default** path separator is **not** just used in Tab Completion, nor is it strictly a PowerShell choice in the Provider system.\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell implementation _switches_ from `\\` to `/` **because** `System.IO.Path.DirectorySeparatorChar` switches. You can see that in the `readonly` values of [SessionStateStrings](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/SessionStateStrings.cs#L19-L37), which are what's used in the [`NormalizePath`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/NavigationProviderBase.cs#L868) method in the provider base class. Everything in PowerShell is based on the underlying .NET implementations, and there's simply no chance the .NET framework will change that, since it is in fact, correct: Windows uses backslashes. Trying to go against that .NET default value in a more general case than just TabExpansion would be _really hard work_.\r\n\r\nThe providers affect all of the Path cmdlets.  Changing that default would affect Convert-Path and Resolve-Path and through them, millions of lines of existing PowerShell code -- including code that is calling `Convert-Path` and passing the result into `cmd` and some old Windows APIs. Changing _that_ default value would be a **breaking change**. I don't think anyone has suggested any benefits from this change would justify breaking things, right?\r\n\r\nHaving said all of that, one final note: if you want to try it, it's possible that asking those constants settable would be a trivial way to get what you originally asked for -- even if it's a little unsafe. Someone should just try [switching it](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/SessionStateStrings.cs#L19-L37) to see what happens. **If that is enough**, we could talk about making it settable...",

    "body": "Here's a proposal that doesn't break backward compatibility, but offers only limited functionality - pragmatically speaking, it may be enough, however.\r\n\r\nIf there's interest and once there is sufficient agreement on the specifics, I suggest we eventually open a new, focused issue. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIntroduce a new Boolean preference variable (meaningful on Windows only), say `$PSUseSlash`, which, when set to `$true` (default is `$false`) controls the following behaviors (only):\r\n\r\n* It makes tab-completion use `/` \r\n\r\n  * Separately, and independently of the preference variable, @lzybkr's suggestion to infer from the user _having typed_ a `/` as part of their path _before completion_ that `/` should be used is worth implementing.\r\n\r\n* It makes (only) those cmdlets that output paths _as strings_ use `/` by default:\r\n  * `Convert-Path`, `Join-Path`, `Split-Path`\r\n  * To support ad-hoc use of `/` too, these cmdlets will get a `-UseSlash` (`-sl`) switch.\r\n  * To convert output from other cmdlets, such as `Get-ChildItem`, to `/`-based paths, it can simply be piped to `Convert-Path [-sl]`\r\n \r\nThe general idea is to focus on the _interactive_ experience: tab-completion and interactively obtaining paths to be copied elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNote that so as not to affect scripts and functions that may not expect `/`-based paths on Windows, it is best to define the preference variable as `$private:PSUseSlash = $true`\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nHere's a proof-of-concept, which can be pasted into or dot-sourced from a `$PROFILE` file as-is:\r\n\r\nThe only limitation is that when you tab-complete a _directory_ path, PowerShell invariably  _appends_ `\\` - something that cannot be prevented via the `TabExpansion2` function.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n<summary><b>Source code:</b></summary>\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n###\r\n# WINDOWS ONLY: Support for using \"/\" as the path separator in tab completion and with Convert-Path, Join-Path.\r\n# See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10509\r\n###\r\nif ($env:OS -eq 'Windows_NT') {\r\n  #

Here's what makes sense to me.\r\n\r\n* `$PSPathSeparator` should default to the platform-native separator, and should only be defined in the _global_ scope (an `AllScope` variable with the value set to `/` on Windows could break existing code).\r\n* The only values you should be able to assign `$PSPathSeparator` are `\\` or `/`\r\n   * `[ValidateSet('\\', '/')] $PSPathSeparator = '@' # boom`\r\n      * As an aside: this constraint should apply to local copies of the variable in _any_ scope, something we currently have a problem with: #3483\r\n   * On Unix, it is debatable whether we should allow setting `\\`; if we disallow it, we would in effect make the variable a constant there.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, from the bike-shedding department: Unfortunately, .NET has introduced terminology confusion with its `[io.path]::PathSeparator` and `[io.path]::DirectorySeparatorChar` properties: leaving the inconsistency with respect to including the word \"Char\" aside, the former - confusingly - refers to the separator used for the entries in the `PATH` _environment variable_ and it is the latter that is more commonly referred to as the path separator.\r\n\r\nIf we follow the logic of these terms, we should choose `$PSItemSeparator`, \"Item\" being the generalization of \"Directory\".\r\n\r\nI do not feel strongly either way.\r\n\r\n(If changing the .NET properties were an option, I'd choose `[io.path]::PathVariableSeparator` and `[io.path]::PathSeparator`)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I think it would be better to use a terse variable name for ease of use in scripts.\r\n\r\nDo we really need two variables for this? I've read the reasoning you have provided, but pairing up variables for this single purpose seems unnecessary to me. My preference would be to have `$OPS` (output path separator, named appropriately to match the output field separator variable), and define it such that assigning any value other than `\\` or `/` results in it being reset to the default value for that OS. You can still use the `private:` scope qualifier to assign a value that is only in a specific scope, and you can use the variable easily in scripts (e.g. `-join $OPS`).\r\n\r\nI haven't put a ton of thought into this, but up front I feel going with a terse name and avoiding having to work with multiple variables is better for scripters in this case.",

Of course, if you _do_ want all child scopes to use `/`, you're free to use `$PSUseSlash = $true` in any scope.\r\n\r\nAgain, the all-scopes `$OPS` automatic variable would then either respect a `$PSUseSlash` variable visible to the current scope, and report `[System.IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar` otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
