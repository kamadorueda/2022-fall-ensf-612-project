    "body": "> It would be a breaking change now, but we probably should have not have the implicit using namespace System if you have any using namespace statements.\r\n\r\nI believe in general this is a good idea, since it would make it equivalent to C# functionality.\r\nHowever it will likely not receive this issue, since System namespace is very likely used in almost any .NET code. I am note a professional developer so I can not really estimate it, but maybe it might make sense that compiler can dynamically recognize the correct class by called method / property name? ...however would probably not really work if accidentally both classes have a property or method with same name.\r\nSo I think it should be made as the classical concept of namespace aliases to resolve name conflicts.\r\n\r\n> We don't have support for type aliases yet, but the intent was to support using type TimeZone = Java.Util.TimeZone - in fact the parser supports this today, but the semantic aspect was never implemented.\r\n\r\nBut sounds quite neat at all. Thumbs up for this. Is PowerShell actually under active development? I can't find information about a planned release, for instance 5.2. I believe that Microsoft released PowerShell core to OpenSource community, but I am not sure.\r\nDoes something like a roadmap for PowerShell exist? :)",
