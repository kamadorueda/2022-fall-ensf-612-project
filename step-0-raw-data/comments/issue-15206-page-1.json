    "body": "As @mklement0 [mentions in his thought](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14732#issuecomment-817366599) and my own feature request for \"[Calculated Objects](https://github.com/iRon7/Join-Object/issues/20)\" related to the propose [Add a Join-Object cmdlet to the standard PowerShell equipment `#14994`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14994), the suggested \"**deferred pipeline *object***\" doesn't differ much from an `[ScriptBlock]`. The difference is in how it is invoked. Meaning that rather than returning all the output items in once, I would like to retrieve just *a single **next*** item and literally ***stall***¹ the (deferred) pipeline. Also knowing that it might be confusing if a variable changes just on the fly when it has been access, it would probably make more sense to implement a distinct syntax (e.g. by using a `%` rather than a `$` for the concerned expression variable) at the invocation side.\r\n\r\n<sub>**1.** as apposed to \"**choke**\", where the items are continued to be enumerated in memory</sub>\r\n\r\nThis:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n%Count\r\n```\r\nCauses currently an error:\r\n> %Count: The term '%Count' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.\r\n> Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n\r\nWishful thinking:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$Count = { 1..3 } # Initialize the deferred pipeline object\r\n%Count\r\n1\r\n%Count\r\n2\r\n%Count\r\n3\r\n%Count # Nothing (`AutomationNull`) returns\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore specific:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$a = { Get-Connect .\\MyHughFile.txt } # or any other long stream\r\n$b = { 1..1e9 } # In the idea, the range shouldn't affect the memory used for $b \r\n$c = { Import-Csv .\\Large.csv }\r\n%a | ForEach-Object { # Not sure about this but could simply be: `Get-Connect .\\MyHughFile.txt |ForEach-Object ...`\r\n    Write-Host '$a item:' $_ \r\n    Write-Host '$b item:' %b # Every time the %b is used, it processes the next item in the deferred $b expression\r\n    Write-Host '$c item:' %c # Ditto for $c\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "I like the idea, although I'm not sure this is that useful, to be honest. It reminds me a lot of `-PipelineVariable`, and I don't see a lot of folks really using that, either. It's a fairly complex thing to reason through and understand, iterating multiple pipelines at once.\r\n\r\nEssentially what this would end up doing is conceptually and functionally similar to this (though, if it could be done as you describe, we'd want there to be less overhead involved).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction next($enumerator) {\r\n    if ($enumerator.MoveNext()) {\r\n        $enumerator.Current\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n$a = (1..1e9).GetEnumerator()\r\n\r\n1..100 | ForEach-Object {\r\n    Write-Host \"Pipeline: $_\"\r\n    Write-Host \"`$a item: $(next $a)\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm also not really sure that deferring the processing is going to be that valuable. For example, in your last example with $b, it's not possible to really defer the creation of the whole array without completely re-architecting how the `..` operator itself works. As soon as that script gets processed for the first time, the array has to be created in full, and then the enumerator captured so the later parts of the script can enumerate it.\r\n\r\nOverall it's an interesting idea, but I'm concerned that it would be overly complex both to actually make use of as well as just to implement it. I think PowerShell's array creation and general pipeline semantics would need a bit of a rethink to make this a worthwhile thing to implement.",

As the  `-PipelineVariable` assigns \"*current*\" items  (`$PSItem`) to different variables in the ***same*** pipeline and the proposal concerns ***separated*** pipelines (and assignments). Although, I do agree that the propose probably adds quite some complexity.\r\n\r\n> it's not possible to really defer the creation of the whole array without completely re-architecting how the `..` operator  itself works.\r\n\r\nI agree: it probably doesn't give any advantage for this specific statement (other than a possible syntactical advantage). Nevertheless, I wonder whether it could improve memory usage and performance¹ when I would load items from e.g. a file (`1..1e9 | Set-Content .\\List.txt`). Unfortunately, I can't that this with your code example as the parentheses required for this '(Set-Content .\\List.txt`).GetEnumerator()` would already load everything in memory...\r\n\r\n<sub>**1.** in case not all lines are eventually loaded, given the example where the `ForEach` will only loop a `100` times</sub>",

There isn't a way to defer execution after a single pipeline object has been emitted.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you were to do this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$b = [Example.PipelineEnumerable]::new{\r\n\tForEach-Object {\r\n\t\tforeach ($a in 0..3) {\r\n\t\t\t$a\r\n\t\t\t$host.UI.WriteErrorLine('ehhh')\r\n\t\t}\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n\r\n$e = $b.GetEnumerator()\r\n$e.MoveNext()\r\n$e.Current\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou get\r\n\r\n```raw\r\nehhh\r\nehhh\r\nehhh\r\nehhh\r\nTrue\r\n0\r\n```\r\n\r\nDuring a pipeline this works because when one item is emitted to the pipeline, execution moves immediately to the next pipeline element's process block.  Without an immediate next method to call, you **must** finish the block. There is no way to suspend and resume execution of a method in dotnet.  Even when C# *seems* to do this (e.g. with async/await and `yield return`), the compiler is really completely changing the method to enable this.",

    "body": "Great stuff, @SeeminglyScience; thanks for clarifying the limitations of steppable pipelines outside of actual pipelines.\r\n\r\nI played around with parallel thread jobs as a - suboptimal - alternative: the `ForEach-CorrespondingObject` function defined below uses _queues_ to buffer output objects in order to ensure that only corresponding output objects are processed; with large output sets and widely differing output timing among the input script blocks, however, you may still run out of memory.\r\n\r\nOf course, this approach isn't efficient, because buffering happens both in the thread jobs and in the function, and output is periodically collected with a short sleep interval between tries.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample call and its output, with verbose output enabled:\r\n\r\n* Two infinite producer script blocks are supplied, which simply output as sequence of numbers, and a the processing script block simple echoes the corresponding number pairs.\r\n  * One of the blocks periodically cleans the screen, to avoid memory issues from overly long console scrollback buffers.\r\n  \r\n* Note that the producers do not run in a _tight_ loop - they sleep briefly between outputting numbers - as there is currently no batching mechanism for `Receive-Object` calls, which could cause a given call to receive objects indefinitely; see:\r\n   * #15234 - the inability to retrieve a given number of objects from a job in a consuming manner.\r\n   * #5433. - proposal to call `Receive-Object` with a timeout.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n{ \r\n  $i=0; $sleepMs = 10\r\n  while ($true) { \r\n    (++$i); Start-Sleep -ms $sleepMs\r\n  } \r\n}, \r\n{ \r\n  $i=0; $sleepMs = 10\r\n  while ($true) { \r\n    (++$i); Start-Sleep -ms $sleepMs\r\n    # To avoid memory problems with an overly long scrollback buffer, we clear it\r\n    # periodically.\r\n  if ($i -gt 1000 -and $i % 1000 -eq 1) { (-not $IsWindows -or [bool] $env:WT_SESSION) ?

If every deferred pipeline spawns a new thread that could get out of hand pretty quickly if folks don't know how heavy it is.
