This works on Linux because the `PsModulePath` is only `bin/Modules`, but on Windows, that variable gets inherited from the environment, and does _not_ contain `bin/Modules`. I am still unsure how to handle this appropriately. However, I'll close this as a duplicate (work-around is in that issue).\n",
