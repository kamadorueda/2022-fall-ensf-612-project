Processes are spawned using the `Runspace` CWD so the process CWD doesn't matter. You _could_ set the CWD if you're using the .NET filesystem APIs as long as you can guarantee that there are no other Runspaces being used which is only possible for personal scripts. But even then, the .NET APIs don't understand PowerShell paths so you're better off using the Provider APIs to resolve the path before passing it to `File.ReadAllText()`. Ultimately, `[Environment]::CurrentDirectory` is exposed because PowerShell exposes .NET and that API is part of .NET. \r\n\r\n",
