    "body": "I think you might need some better examples. \r\nGenerally  `Add-` commands add one of something, and usually specify something to make the new instance unique. Adding 10 one just does `1..10 | % {add-thing  parameters}  `\r\nThe `add-thing {give me 10 more and work out IDs}`  scenario is unusual. \r\n\r\n`Set ... n` sets the value of an existing thing to n. So you might have `Set-Pool -membercount n` and the set command figures out what has to be  done to make it so. \r\nFor making a pool bigger there is also Expand (though this is paired with compress for make smaller).  So `Expand-Pool -members 20`\r\n\r\n> * My functionality depends on the user providing optional parameters that can be easily omitted by the user and lead to user errors. For example, if my my script spins up cloud VMs at $200/pop it would be expensive for the user to _think_ they're adding just 1 instance with `Add-Instances 1`, and then forgetting that optional parameter, running `Add-Instances` instead and incurring a $2,000 cost.\r\n\r\nThis would imply that (unlike other `add` commands ) this one defaults to repeating 10 times, which sounds like a bad choice. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure about decrease as \"remove 10 from a pool of 20\" without selection criteria.  `Get-Poolmember | select -first 10 | remove-poolMember` seems dangerous. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@jhoneill Please note this example above is super simplified, so I don't have to elaborate on the specific business needs. What seems like a \"bad choice\" for you might be a good business logic choice for me.\r\n\r\nHowever, the bottom line for me is: I don't think the choice of a scripting language should dictate what kind of business functionality I can and cannot implement with it, do you? I don't think the job of a scripting language is to evaluate my business needs and inform me that something is a \"bad idea\" from a business perspective, do you?\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind, I simply need to `Add` something, `Set `something and *also* to `Increase` something, with all of these verbs having a slightly different meaning and slightly different functionality.\r\n\r\nI can't believe I'm even having to spend this much time debating what to name my function, just so it complies with a language best practice/requirement.. 100x more time spent on coming up with a proper name than the time it took me to implement said function.. ðŸ¤¦\r\n",
