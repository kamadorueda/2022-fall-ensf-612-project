When you create a hard link (using something like mklink /h), you're really just passing in \"target\" file as a means to identity the underlying data on the file system to create a new named pointer to.  By definition, every named file has one hard link and you can have any number of hard links for a specific piece of data on the file system.   Junctions and symbolic links are a different story -- they have specific targets.",

    "body": "Windows PowerShell takes a sensible approach: it will return an array of hard links that are not the same as the file being queried.  So let's say I create two hard links called 'A' and 'B' that using 'C' as a reference.  In Windows PowerShell, I look at the Target property for 'A', I get an array of @('B','C'); if I look at 'B', I get an array of @('A','C'); if I look at 'C', I get an array of @('A','B').  \r\n\r\nLooking at the file system provider in PowerShell Core, I do not see any effort to enumerate hard links.  My guess is that this is due the desire to maintain feature parity between Linux and Windows. Linux does not have a great way to query all hard links associated with a file (i.e. you have to enumerate every file on physical volume to see if a file points to the same physical location).",
