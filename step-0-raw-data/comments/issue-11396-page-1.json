    "body": "Adding `-SkipHeaderValidation` would break people running the script on lower versions (5.1, 6.x). Spongemike2 came up with a different workaround, which does not require checking a version number:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nif (-not $ContentType)\r\n{\r\n    Remove-Variable   -Name ContentType\r\n    $ContentType =   $null\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am of course not opposed to anybody reporting anything to the dotnet/runtime people. But without having done any research into it, it doesn't seem like it would be necessarily wrong for them to treat `null` and `String.Empty` as different. And even if they did decide to change something, I assume it would be quite some time before that change was available to PS.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is still a breaking change for PS: it used to work, now it does not.\r\n\r\nAnother question to consider: should we *want* this breaking change in PS? Maybe the additional flexibility allowed by treating `null` and `String.Empty` differently are something that we would want to be able to pass on to PS users (albeit at the cost of being a breaking change). I don't do web-ish stuff for my day job, so I really don't have any sort of gut feel for it--I leave it to wiser and more experienced minds to consider. But if we keep the breaking change, it would be nice to have it documented. (I assume there will be a list of breaking changes when PSv7 is released.)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
