Instead, implement another `ConvertTo-Json` in a separate class, say`ConvertToJsonCommand2`. Then apply `ExperimentalFeatureAttribute` to both `ConvertToJsonCommand` and `ConvertToJsonCommand2` just like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ExperimentalFeature(\"NewConvertToJson\", ExperimentAction.Hide)]\r\n[Cmdlet(\"ConvertTo\", \"Json\", ....)]\r\npublic class ConvertToJsonCommand : PSCmdlet { ... }\r\n\r\n[ExperimentalFeature(\"NewConvertToJson\", ExperimentAction.Show)]\r\n[Cmdlet(\"ConvertTo\", \"Json\", ....)]\r\npublic class ConvertToJsonCommand2 : PSCmdlet { ... }\r\n```",

The issues identified here are also issues in 5.x. There have been enhancements in the cross platform PowerShell such as `-EnumsAsStrings` and `-AsHashtable` and `-AsArray` and `-EscapeHandling` that are not available to Windows PowerShell 5.1. Yet there are scenarios where simply pointing users to PowerShell 7 as the solution forward is not viable. Plus there are discussions here about breaking changes. A standalone module that carries JSON conversion forward using the .NET Core JSON APIs while addressing the bulk of the issues with JSON in PowerShell today (including fully bi-directional conversion) would be a much better way to bring the Microsoft JSON.NET libraries into PowerShell than simply updating what we have as a built-in module that isn't available elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAlso this hasn't moved forward in some time. Is that partly due to concerns about these breaking changes? If so, again, a standalone optional module that supersedes what Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7.x have baked in today seems like a better solution.",

As result they get huge community contributions.\r\nWith the model all you would need to do you would add publishing of a new nuget package.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, PowerShell MSFT team cannot find a middle ground - many community PRs are frozen here and PowerShell/modules repository does not work at all.\r\nOf course, you can always develop your own project to meet your needs... I suspect that if you need quick results today, then you are destined for it (own project). :-(\r\n\r\n> Also this hasn't moved forward in some time. Is that partly due to concerns about these breaking changes?\r\n\r\nMy intentions were:\r\n- to create early implementation so that we can feedback to .Net team while they actively worked on .Net 5.0.\r\n- to avoid breaking changes as possible and pass all our current tests without changes\r\n- later to add new fixes in separate commits so that we explicitly see new breaking changes.\r\n\r\nAs for breaking changes, there are two places:\r\n- in .Net\r\nThey implemented new API with compatibility with NewtonSoft Json.Net and fix some bugs and inconsistences. As result the new API has many breaking changes compared with Json.Net ( and PowerShell too because PowerShell uses Json.Net)\r\n- in PowertShell\r\nPowerShell has bugs and inconsistences too. Fixing its will add breaking changes.\r\n\r\nIn the end, we come to the conclusion that in any case, when we switch to the new API, we will receive many breaking changes. I hoped that we get this in 7.1 as experimental feature for easy community adoption.

    "body": "@iSazonov Thank you for the detailed reply.\r\n\r\n> Of course, you can always develop your own project to meet your needs... I suspect that if you need quick results today, then you are destined for it (own project). :-(\r\n\r\nThis is what we have now -- some proxy functions to override the ConvertTo-Json/ConvertFrom-Json cmdlets where needed. But ultimately I don't want to spend time on something that should come from PowerShell itself as a separate module, and I don't want to own the development of something that is so fundamental that it really should be managed by Microsoft. I'm doing it because I have to, but with bugs like #3705 plus performance benefits from switching to .NET Core JSON APIs, I'd rather converge on a PowerShell team-managed solution than roll my own, because I have much bigger things to focus on that are far more important than JSON conversion (which should be something people can simply take for granted as being there with a solid, performant implementation, in both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell).\r\n\r\n> In the end, we come to the conclusion that in any case, when we switch to the new API, we will receive many breaking changes. I hoped that we get this in 7.1 as experimental feature for easy community adoption. But :-(\r\n\r\nI think a standalone module and Nuget package would be far superior to an experimental feature in this case. But I suppose I already said that.\r\n\r\n> Only specific convertor is created for PSObject. Do you ask to put it in nuget library and reference SMA (PowerShell SDK)?\r\n\r\nThat would be fine. I have no problem needing the PowerShell SDK as a dependency. I'm already using it. I'm also only looking for conversion to/from PS entities such as PSObject, Hashtable, etc. I just want to avoid needing to call into PowerShell when I already have my object data that needs conversion in my C# code.",
