(Note that I did not methodically test every *about* document.)   \r\n\r\nHowever, I'm not sure this proves the original problem has been addressed.   The reason I have doubts is that PS Core 6.1  comes with a much smaller set of \"about\" documents than the .NET Windows version of Powershell 5.1 .  In order to test this I would need to know which About topics that fail in PS5.1  are also legitimate topics in PSCore6.1\r\n ",

Running that command in PSCore6.1  gets a VERY different (and much smaller)  list of about topics then running that command in PS5.1.  This is (ofcourse) expected.   There is a large set of .NET specific about topics that do not belong in the Core build.      My question is this:  Are there any About topics that fail (due to this bug)  in PS5.1  that are available in PSCore6.1?      \r\nI think its a reasonable expectation that one could run the EXACT same PS command in both versions to test whether the underlying issue is resolved.

Not one of these duped topics is available in PS Core, at least as far as I can determine right here. :) \r\n\r\nInterestingly, during this little adventure I found this can actually be worked around by the savvy user (as long as the help is actually available in the console and isn't online-exclusive -- a few topics are, not sure if any are on this list) by doing the following:\r\n```\r\n get-help about_ForEach-Parallel | group | select -exp name\r\n```\r\nWhich, for some reason I cannot find, manages to pull the entire help contents, where no amount of `Select`ing on the usual objects you get will do so -- for some reason you have to `Group` them first, which pulls extra data into the `Name` property somehow?",
