Cross-platform implies that the binary module loads across OS platforms (to most folks). But that can be satisfied by compiling against netcoreapp2.0.  Such a binary will load into PS Core running on any platform supported by PS Core but not Windows PowerShell.  I guess `portable` is somewhat synonymous.  What I'm really looking for is that word that says \"single binary that runs anywhere including in Windows PowerShell\".",

I'm probably just getting lucky and this could all fall apart as different netstandard2.0 binary modules that user varying versions of the same package are imported.  \r\n\r\nUnless and until, Microsoft provides an update to Windows PowerShell 3 and 5.x that provides all the necessary binding redirects, facades and shims (if this is even possible given that Win PS has to deal with add-ins i.e binary modules), maybe our position should be - this works on .NET 4.7.1 and that's that.  IOW your binary module's users will have to be on Windows 10 FCU or higher or they will have to update to .NET 4.7.1.  If that isn't acceptable, you'll have to multi-target and build for net461 as well as netstandard2.0.  I guess that procedure could be the subject of another \"how to\".",
