I don't see a reason for not publishing the packages even if some tests fail later on because if it is something that is just a prototype/experiment then I would not want to be blocked on that, in fact, the packages are the first thing that I want from a build.\r\nI do think that trying to cache dotnet does not pay off the zip/unzip/upload/download costs, instead of just installing the required dotnet SDK anyway (which takes only 12 seconds to download, extract and install). Especially in forks, the cache is too big for the free version, therefore that time is wasted because it fails at the end.\r\nI now set an environment variable `DOTNET_SKIP_FIRST_TIME_EXPERIENCE` to `1` to avoid unnecessary cache initialisation in this case, which saves around one minute",
