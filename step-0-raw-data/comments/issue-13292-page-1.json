    "body": "The WMI cmdlets have been effectively deprecated since PowerShell v3 when the CIM cmdlets were introduced to replace them. It was [called out](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/breaking-changes-ps6?view=powershell-7#wmi-v1-cmdlets) as a breaking change in PowerShell v6 that the old WMI cmdlets were removed and to use the CIM cmdlets instead. So your example would now be\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_PnpSignedDriver\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome of the bigger changes from the WMI -> CIM cmdlets were how some data types were serialized as a PowerShell object, i.e. date time values were a DateTime object\r\n\r\n```\r\n$date = Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InstallDate\r\n$date\r\n$date.GetType()\r\n\r\n# 20200113185054.000000+600\r\n#\r\n# IsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType\r\n# -------- -------- ----                                     --------\r\n# True     True     String                                   System.Object\r\n\r\n$date = Get-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InstallDate\r\n$date\r\n$date.GetType()\r\n\r\n# Monday, January 13, 2020 6:50:54 PM\r\n# IsPublic IsSerial Name                                     BaseType\r\n# -------- -------- ----                                     --------\r\n# True     True     DateTime                                 System.ValueType\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne of the other changes is around remoting with WMI. The older WMI cmdlets used DCOM as the transport whereas the CIM instances default to WinRM. Using remoting is the same with the `-ComputerName` parameter but if you still need DCOM for whatever reason you can still achieve that with the CIM cmdlets using a CIM session.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName server\r\n\r\n$sessionOpt = New-CimSessionOption -Protocol DCOM\r\n$session = New-CimSession -ComputerName server -SessionOption $sessionOpt\r\nGet-CimInstance -ClassName Win32_OperatingSystem -CimSession $session\r\n$session | Remove-CimSession\r\n```",
