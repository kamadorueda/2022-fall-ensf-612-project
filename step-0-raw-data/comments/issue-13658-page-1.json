    "body": "When I first read through this, my reaction was similar to jhoneill and vexx32, along the lines of \"this will annoy roughly as many people as it pleases\" (or more). Because in a non-trivial module, I typically have functionality broken up into lots of functions--it's an entire library, with everything working together. So what happens is, yeah, sometimes I might want Verbose output only from \"just my code\", but that's never just one function; it calls several helpers, which each call several helpers, etc.\r\n\r\nWith the \"opt-in\" mechanism... maybe that could be reasonable, but I'm still not convinced it's necessary or would even do what most people want.\r\n\r\n1. **Not necessary:** My strategy for dealing with this is to simply hardcode `-Verbose:$false` on external calls that I don't want to see Verbose output for. For example, calls to `Import-Module` (which of course requires me to also explicitly pre-load dependencies to avoid #13657, ugh).\r\n\r\n2. **Not what people want:** as mentioned in my opening paragraph, I believe what is actually wanted is \"Verbose output for 'Just My Code'\", not \"Verbose output for 'Just This Function'\".\r\n\r\nPerhaps the idea could be re-worked again, from a per-function opt-in thing, to something like a still-dynamically-scoped-but-stops-at-module-boundaries concept. But given that I don't think it's necessary in the first place, that seems like a lot of complication for no good reason.\r\n\r\nDoes my strategy for (1) not cover some scenario?",
