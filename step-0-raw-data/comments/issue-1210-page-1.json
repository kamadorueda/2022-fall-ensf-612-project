On the other hand, if it's like another 2 weeks, it could be too long and I don't think we should wait that much. I believe @TravisEz13 captured most of the regressions in the issues already. Plus, we can create a branch before update, so we are able to reproduce this Nano test pass results. @daxian-dbw we need a Nano CoreCLR update timeline to make a right call.\n",
