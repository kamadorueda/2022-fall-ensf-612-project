Recently started to while I am using MS Graph and EWS Managed API and have no need for Windows PowerShell when doing so.  I was caught off guard by this change, and am very used to -Debug resulting in Inquire.  I found debugging this way, way easier than anything else.  Debugging in VS Code seemed difficult and so I stuck with -Debug = Inquire.\r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily opposed to the new way, but I would like to know where is some decent documentation on how to debug as easily.  I really like to Suspend, jump in and investigate.  It's how I hone in all my scripts and flush out errors.  I don't like to just see streams of info blowing by, so really need that Suspend capability.\r\n\r\nPlease do share if you can.  I'll also start researching on the topic.  This is a doozy of a change indeed.  If it means debugging the old way in a regular PowerShell console isn't possible, ouch.",

    "body": "Hey @JeremyTBradshaw, thanks for responding back. I was really curious if there would be resistance among some folk, and the fact that you're responding rather than just silently complaining is very helpful.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to help you out with this, either via back-and-forth texts, or a call on Microsoft Teams where we can screenshare and I could show you the ropes of the debugger. That would be helpful for me as well, to learn how you would like to use the debugger, and make sure that your needs are covered. Maybe the outcome of this will be a document describing what you're looking for: how to transition from `-Debug`'s Inquire capability to the using the full power of the debugger without losing your mind in the process.",

That would prevent the progress window from appearing, which should help what you just tried a little.

I would take you up on the Teams meeting offer if it still stands.  Not sure when you had in mind but I've just exposed my email address on my GitHub profile and my tomorrow is currently open so if that works, that'd be great.  I should be quick to pick it up, so really it won't be long, and I can quickly show you the way I've been using -Debug.  The short version is that I commonly place Write-Debug's in my code wherever I'd like to jump in to troubleshoot or test, and then run with -Debug.  Whereas you're confirming you do your proper debugging in the console, that is good to hear, so again, look forward to the chance to get a quick rundown on this.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
