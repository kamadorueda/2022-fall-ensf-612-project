    "body": "@bpayette Yeah that sentence got away from me a bit.\r\n\r\nLets say I'm building a module that has a mix of cmdlets and functions, and I have some utility classes on the C# side that I might typically make `internal`.  If I want to reuse those utility classes in the PowerShell portion of the module, then I either need to use reflection or make the class public.\r\n\r\nIf the proposed change was made, I would be able to do this instead:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Utils.cs\r\nnamespace MyModule.Internal\r\n{\r\n    [Hidden, EditorBrowsable(EditorBrowsableState.Never)]\r\n    public static class Utils\r\n    {\r\n        // Some utility method to handle path resolution and error handling uniformly.\r\n        public static string TransformPath(PSCmdlet cmdlet, string path) => null;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# MyModule.psm1\r\nfunction Test-Something {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param(\r\n        [Parameter()]\r\n        [string] $Path\r\n    )\r\n    end {\r\n        $fullPath = [MyModule.Internal.Utils]::TransformPath($PSCmdlet, $Path)\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
