If you want the inherited $x won't `$x` provide what you want in almost all cases ? \r\nSome example code to show why I think `Get-Variable` isn't needed. \r\n```\r\nfunction a {\r\n$x = 1 \r\n\"Local x in a is '$local:x' ; x is '$x'\"\r\nb\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction b {\r\n\"Local x in b is '$local:x' ; x is '$x'\"\r\nc\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction c {\r\n\"Local x in c is '$local:x' ; x is '$x'\"\r\n}\r\n\r\na\r\nLocal x in a is '1' ; x is '1'\r\nLocal x in b is '' ; x is '1'\r\nLocal x in c is '' ; x is '1'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows that in B and C, we can test for  \"X was (not) set locally\", \"X has a value\" therefore it's simple to get to \"X was inherited\", _without caring where from_  If X is a parameter or a preference variable set via a parameter, I'm trying to think of a real-world use case for wanting to know what it was before it was set here. \"$x from all higher scopes but not this one\" is something I have never needed myself, so I'm having trouble imagining a use for it.   \r\n\r\nIn a more complicated example.\r\n```\r\nfunction c {\r\n## other code would be here\r\n    if     ($local:x )    {\"x was set in This function\"}    \r\n    elseif ($x -and     (Get-Variable -Name X -Scope 1 -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue) ) {\r\n          \"x was set in this function's parent\"\r\n    }\r\n    elseif ($global:x ) {\r\n          \"x was set in the Global scope\"\r\n    }\r\n    else  { \"x was set higher than this functions parent but not globally\"}\r\n}\r\n\r\nPS> a\r\nLocal x in a is '1' ; x is '1'\r\nLocal x in b is '' ; x is '1'\r\nx was set higher than this functions parent but not globally\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis shows an example where we don't want the present behaviour of `Get-Variable` to change (we want to know if a variable was or was not set in scope 1)  but **maybe** a \"AND ABOVE\"  switch could be helpful - but as a I said my imagination isn't giving me any cases. \r\n\r\n\r\nAs @SeeminglyScience  says variables don't inherit out of modules and I have a post about that, and how preference variables can be passed here:    \r\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community/how-to-have-more-control-of-preferences-in-functions-and-the-role-of-modules-on-inheritance/   it's not clear from the question if you are trying to solve a problem with `$DebugPreference` but that post might help if you are. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2021/02/PSHero-240x240-1.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community/wp-content/uploads/sites/69/2021/02/Square150x150Logo.png\" height=\"14\"> PowerShell Community</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell-community/how-to-have-more-control-of-preferences-in-functions-and-the-role-of-modules-on-inheritance/\">On Preferences and Scopes</a></strong></div><div>Progress in PowerShell: a tale of Verbosity and other preferences with lessons in Scopes and Proxies thrown in It started, as these things often do, with someone complaining.

This comes down to:\r\n* By default `Write-Log` displays and logs messages (along with other stuff that doesn't apply to this issue)\r\n* If the command `Write-Log -Debug` is given, there is nothing shown/written unless it is in debug mode. Meaning that the `-Debug` parameter is also supplied to one of the (grand) parents. (Or the `$DebugPreference` is set other than `SilentlyContinue` in the higher scopes)\r\n* The same behavior counts for the `-Verbose` parameter\r\n\r\nFor this I need to known whether the `$DebugPreference` is set to anything else than `SilentlyContinue` by its caller (*and above*). I also need to specifically *exclude* the `Local` scope (`-Scope 0`) as that is changed by the local `-Debug` and `-Verbose` parameters.\r\nBtw. everything is working as designed with the workaround as laid out in the initial enhancement request, I was just looking for a syntactic sugar...\r\n\r\nI understand this is a quiet specific use case, but than, what says your imagination for a use case of `Get-Variable -Scope <number>` (that could possibly generate an error) in general?",

    "body": "The number of times I've needed `Get-Variable` at all has been very small, and I've used `Set-variable` with `-Scope` to do something similar to `-OutVariable` / `-ErrorVariable` to leave something in a variable selected by the caller where that is different from the _output_.   \r\n\r\nBecause I have solved this problem for one case with the stuff in that post I would probably use hidden parameters prefixed with \"parent\" or similar to get the value when the function was called. That doesn't mean it is the perfect way to do it, but knowing a a solution for almost the same problem I would adapt it. You have another work round, and this is very specific - I wouldn't expect the extra parameter to be rejected as a bad idea, but I don't see it being treated as important enough to get time allocated to it. \r\n  ",
