For tuple, this works because of the extension methods in `System.TupleExtensions`.  The `Deconstruct` extension method that would be used in the above example has this signature:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic static void Deconstruct<int, string>(this Tuple<int, string> value, out int item1, out string item2);\r\n```\r\n\r\n[More information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/deconstruct)",

If a system for resolving extension methods internally within the engine was added for this feature, it would partially add support with less risk. That'd make a full implementation potentially a lot easier down the road.",
