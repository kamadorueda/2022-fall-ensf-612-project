    "body": "Hi @SeeminglyScience, thanks for the quick answer.\r\n\r\nI think that `AllowNull()` is not the right answer for this case given that the ArrayList is not null. It's a completely valid instance of a list, it's just that one of its elements happens to be `$null`.\r\n\r\nI personally wouldn't expect this use case to require `AllowNull()`, especially given that using that attribute will make it so that the ArrayList itself could be a `$null` reference, which isn't what I want.",
