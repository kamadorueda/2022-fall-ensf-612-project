Assuming the kernel is not extremely different between 26 and 27, the instructions for 26 should probably work for 27. ",

I suspect that any bug that shows up in 27 would reproduce in 26.  Regardless, if a bug is discovered in 27 and it can be fixed without regression in other OSes, than it could still be valuable. Even if MS doesn't officially support it, the Community may have interest in resolving the bug. ",
