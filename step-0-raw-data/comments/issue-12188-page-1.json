And PowerShell sets that expectation. \r\nYou can do \r\n```\r\n$p = resolve-path '..\\builds to workitems.txt'                                                                                                                              \r\n$q = Get-ChildItem ..\\DeadBranches.xlsx  \r\n$r = '..\\pipelines.xlsx'                                                                                                                                                    \r\ncopy $p,$q,$r -Destination temp \r\n```\r\nAnd pass an array with a string, a fileinfo and a path Info. \r\nSetting the type of FileInfo causes a bunch of failures. \"foo.txt\"  will convert to a read-only non-existent file in a system directory if you say [FileInfo]$TextFile and the user assumes they can pass a string holding a relative path. \r\n\r\nTyping parameters used wisely can help both user and programmer. If there is a command which takes a count saying the $count is [int32] is fine because there is no way it could be a secure string. But often they are a sign of someone who hasn't considered that the people who will use the finished code will want flexibility. In the end it comes down to are functions APIs or User interfaces ? Of course they are both, but an acceptable API can be a horrible and frustrating UI. A good UI rarely makes a poor API\r\n\r\n[end rant] \r\n",

    "body": "Flexibility is a good thing @jhoneill but there are limits, depending on how the code is designed. As you mentioned, you're not going to throw a securestring at an int32 parameter. That's example my point. \r\n\r\nMy point is not that there _shouldn't_ be flexibility -- I make extensive use of transformation attributes for better UX in my own modules. However, I do think that the help metadata attached to a cmdlet (which the parameter type is _always_ a part of, whether you like it or not; it's reported by Get-Help and forms part of the implicit documentation for a command).\r\n\r\nI'm a fan of it being as flexible as is reasonably possible, but I'd also prefer as specific a type given to the cmdlet parameter from a user perspective as is reasonable. Users that see `[securestring]` typically can infer the purpose of the input and that it will require potentially sensitive information passed in. \r\n\r\nAllowing the flexibility to input a string is great for some applications (and yes, securestring isn't secure, that's a whole other topic; I'm talking about user expectations here), but if we type the parameter itself as `[string]` or `[object]` and that's what shows up in the `Get-Help` or `Get-Command -Syntax` result for that parameter, we're doing the user a disservice by not properly communicating that the command may be handling sensitive data.",

This does mean that scripts would not be portable between 7.1+ and downlevel, but users may decide this tradeoff is worthwhile and have a `#requires -version 7.1` at the top of script.  However, it seems that there may be some security concerns doing this but I don't have any specific examples where this could be a problem.  Thoughts?",
