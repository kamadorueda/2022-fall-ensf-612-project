We'll start looking into using the first example since right now we're not using the Mandatory parameter for a parameter which is mandatory. Instead, we're letting other validation handle that situation which is not necessarily ideal.\n\nThanks for looking into it anyway\n",

For example:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n    Param(\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'MatchName', Mandatory)][Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'MatchPattern', Mandatory)][SessionObject] $Session,\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'MatchName')][String] $Name,\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'MatchPattern', Mandatory)][String] $Pattern,\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName = 'MatchPattern', Mandatory)][String] $MatchOn\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nI want to be able to check that Pattern is passed if MatchOn is passed. If Name is passed, I don't care about that pattern match being mandatory. So I could write some logic that tries to emulate what PowerShell itself is doing, but it would seem more useful to be able to just run the command and see how PowerShell reacts (and without the risk of it sitting waiting for input in the case of a missing param).",
