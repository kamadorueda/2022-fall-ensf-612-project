I guess the installer needs to have a checkbox to make adding to any sort of PATH or app path optional.\r\nMy proposal would be to have a global `pwsh.exe` similar to `dotnet.exe` that then decided into which specific version to call into, which gets decided using e.g. a `/version` parameter and/or something similar to a `global.json` that contains the major and minor version to be used.",

    "body": "Ooh, tough one but I guess that also applies to the question \"How would you handle that from the command line anyway?\" - what is the approach for SxS when a user goes in to cmd.exe first and enters pwsh.exe but they have 6.0.x and 6.1.x installed?\r\n\r\nI believe the default \"App Path\" version should always be the latest version to avoid confusion and frustration. If an older version overwrites the PATH or \"App Path\" just because it was installed afterward, there'll be mutiny.\r\n\r\nChoice is the best option so a default checked \"Set as default PowerShell Core version?\" with a \"What does this mean?\" link or something to some documentation may be the best initial choice. In the documentation, it's spelled out that if they wish to schedule tasks using a specific version, they must specify the full path to the binary they want...however it results in the same problem I've had; if an SxS version of say 6.0.1 is upgraded to 6.0.2 and the \"App Path\" entry remains as pointing to 6.1.0, their scheduled tasks with the path to the 6.0.1 version break, as per #5919.\r\n\r\nOne for the community to give an opinion on as something tells me the cost of having a main entry \"exe\" which decides the version to use will cause other compatibility problems and have a cost. I like the idea of a switch in the binary but I've no idea how that would be handled in terms of dealing with looping, runtime, elevation.",
