    "body": "Ah sweet. So as long as it's done interactively like this, it can happen. On *nix, if they say yes, you append a line to the end of their .bashrc with `PATH=\"$PATH:<additional path>\"`. The message will want to be updated so it explicitly asks something along the lines of \"Do you want installation path '...' added to your PATH in your ~/.bashrc file?\" Since the user could very well be using another shell (Zsh, PowerShell, etc.) and would need to update a different profile. This is very commonly done.\n\nOn that note, perhaps we should offer to add it to their PowerShell profile off the bat. We need to know our *nix customers' user of these scripts. Are they expecting self-contained executables runnable from within their Bash/Zsh shells, (in which case the scripts themselves will likely need to be modified; I suspect they're lacking `chmod +x` and `#!/usr/bin/env powershell`), or just scripts invokable from their PowerShell session?\n",
