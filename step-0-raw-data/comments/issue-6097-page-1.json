    "body": "I considered this very issue when rewriting the parser in V3. I concluded that though weird, it wasn't actively harmful, had some benefits, and changing it would break existing scripts.\r\n\r\nA PowerShell function treated to some degree like a filename - e.g. if you could have a native command like `7z`, then it should be possible to wrap that command in a function.\r\n\r\nYou also have to consider the language versus the api. It is possible to define a function via an api, e.g. via `InitialSessionState`. You may also define a function with `Set-Item Function:Name`. Changing the parser doesn't address those scenarios.",
