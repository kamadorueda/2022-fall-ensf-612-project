If I access`http://localhost:8000` with my web browser (or curl or whatever) or, as mentioned, try with `Test-NetConnection` it does work. I don't know if this behaviour is just \"convenient\" or RFC-dictated, but I can't think of another tool does not behave this way. I understand, though, that `Test-Connection` is primarily an ICMP tool, and it may make more sense in its context to just consider the first resolved address across the whole program, but I think it is reasonable to expect `Test-Connection localhost -TcpPort 8000` to return `True` in a case like this. Maybe there could just be a note in the documentation about it.",

    "body": "The basic `Test-NetConnection` uses ICMP to ping the remote host. By specifying the `-Port` parameter, the cmdlet used TCP to attempt to make a connection to the specified port. If you have port 8000 open, the cmdlet should report true if the remote host accepts the connection. Firewalls do have a way of interfering, though.\r\n\r\nMy home has full IPV6 connectivity and I find Windows seems to choose IPv6. Looking at Tracert traces the IPv6 path tends to be a little shorter and faster than IPv4, but mileage varies.\r\n\r\nThe OP's issue is that when Windows resolved `localhost`, the answer has the IPv6 address first. You can observe this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Foo> resolve-dnsname localhost\r\n\r\nName                                 Type   TTL   Section    IPAddress\r\n----                                 ----   ---   -------    ---------\r\nlocalhost                            AAAA   1200  Question   ::1\r\nlocalhost                            A      1200  Question   127.0.0.1\r\n```\r\nSo what `Test-NetConnection` attempts the connection (ie over IPV6) it naturally fails.\r\n\r\nNot sure this is really a problem that PowerShell can fix.\r\n",
