    "body": "My guess is that most of this slowness comes from `Get-DscResource` that's called when  running `Invoke-DscResource`, because it's ran every time, it lists all resources available in all `$Env:PSmodulePath`, and does it recursively through the paths...\r\n@KristiyanGK if you try to change your `$Env:PSModulePath` just before you run the `Invoke-DscResource` to only contain the folder that has your resource, it might get a little bit faster.\r\n\r\nAn potential way to optimise this could be to better support the pipeline in the `Invoke-DscResource` cmdlet, so that the listing of all available resources is done once and cached in the begin block, then the process block does the invocations.\r\nFor that the Parameters `Method` and `Property` should implement `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName`.",
