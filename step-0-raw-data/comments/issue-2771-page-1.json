    "body": "By reading the code, it looks to me that `RenderHelper` will only be called through `ProgressPane.Show`, and `ProgressPane.Show` will never be called from 2 different threads simultaneously -- it's either being called on the pipeline thread, or called from a timer thread, and only one timer thread will be running at any given time. That means at any given time, only 1 thread will be executing `RenderHelper` method, so a read-write lock won't help improve concurrency.\r\n\r\nSecond, this lock protects accessing to the type field `_topLevelNodes`, but there are other type members also shared between the main pipeline thread and `_progPane.Show` running on the timer thread, `_rawui` and `_progressRegion` are another 2 examples. I didn't do thorough analysis to know if those shared members can actually cause other race conditions, but it's possible.\r\n\r\nMaybe we should just have a lock in `ConsoleHostUserInterfaceProgress.cs` to protect the call to `_pendingProgress.Update(sourceId, record)` in `HandleIncomingProgressRecord` and the call to `_progPane.Show(_pendingProgress)` in `ProgressPaneUpdateTimerElapsed`. I think that will cause very minimum performance degradation to the timer improvement.\r\n\r\n@lzybkr @iSazonov Any thoughts?",

After talking to @SteveL-MSFT and @lzybkr, we feel the safest fix for now (to unblock CI/daily build) is to revert the original timer change.
