    "body": "You have to remember, with PSRP, the client and target server must trust each other somehow in order to open a remoting session. The server can always trust the client if it gets a credential object that resolves to a credential the servers know and against which to allow access. That bit is easy, almost. But how does the client trust the server. If you use `Enter-PSSession -Computer $Computerhname`, how do you know that the computer responding really is who it says it is, vs a man in the middle? With server authentication, the client can be assured that either the server really is to be trusted (eg via Kerberos or SSL), or you explicitly say you trust. Remember DNS is not foolproof. :-)\r\n\r\nIf we separate the PSRP client/server piece from the transport piece, you **are** able to run PSRP over both WinRM and SSH It seems to me that remoting over WinRM, as a default, but allowing other transports is what you are asking for and what is possible.\r\n\r\nSadly, SSH is not installed by default on any supported Windows Server edition and is not installable via `Install-WindowsFeature`. But that is an issue for another place. MSFT really missed the boat (with Server 2022) regarding updating what can be installed via the Server Manager module. It would also be nice to improve `Enable-PsRemoting` to have a `-Transport` parameter that ensured the chosen transport was installed and available. ",
