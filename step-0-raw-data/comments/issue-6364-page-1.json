I guess it's usually up to the package repositories managers to make a package available for the distro he's in charge of. Or to project developers to give a generic installation script.\r\n\r\nMaybe if powershell's installation scripts relied on something else than `/etc/lsb-release`, like `/etc/os-release` (which includes a `ID_LIKE=\"debian\"` line for example) or `/proc/version`, it would handle more cases.\r\n\r\nOr maybe the simplest solution would be to duplicate `installpsh-debian.sh` in `installpsh-ubuntu.sh`. The Ubuntu script would always use `ubuntu` as distribution ID, and the Debian script would always use `debian` as distribution ID. Then the `DISTRIB_VERSION` would be read from the environment variable, and if it's not set, from the `/etc/lsb-release` or `/etc/os-release` files. I could then install powershell on BunsenLabs or any other distribution based on Debian 8 with `DISTRIB_VERSION=8 ./installpsh-debian.sh`.",
