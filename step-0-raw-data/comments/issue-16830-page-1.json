Parser process the input a statement by statement. In your example, Parser eats `switch` statement and then start to process next statement and recognizes a pipeline with empty first element.\r\nPowerShell language defines [Pipeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pipelines?view=powershell-7.2) as a series of _commands_ connected by pipeline operators. PowerShell expects an expression or an command on first place. Expression has one value (@MartinGC94's example). Command can write to pipeline many values (your workaround).\r\n\r\nSo you request is to auto convert an statement to a command. It is ~impossible~ questionable because this could break _shell_ language. `Enter` is a statement terminator - after you type full switch statement and press `Enter` PowerShell executes the statement. Forcing users to use only ';' as statement terminator is huge breaking change.\r\n",

This is not different from how it currently works for scriptblocks (or commands with scriptblock parameters) in the shell. When pressing Enter after `}`, you can't continue writing pipeline commands. So I don't see a breaking change when converting statement to command.\r\n\r\n~~~powershell\r\n# This doesn't work in shell\r\nForEach-Object { 42 }\r\n| Write-Host\r\n\r\n# But you can write\r\nForEach-Object { 42\r\n} | Write-Host\r\n\r\n# Wishful thinking - no big difference to previous sample\r\nforeach( $i in 0..1 ) { $i\r\n} | Write-Host\r\n~~~\r\n",

Too much for the benefit. \r\n\r\nIIRC the grammar of PowerShell says everything is either a _statement_  (loops, conditionals, try / catch , function, filter, break, continue, return, throw etc) or a _pipeline_ which  is either an expression or a command  or one of those two piped to a command.  And of course `& {xxx}`  and  `$( xxx )`  qualify as command and expression respectively even if `xxx` is a statement.  I think it was the changing the nature of statements which was the problem. \r\n\r\n",

As these are language elements, the compiler generates code for the switch and switch body inline. Everything that would write to the current output pipe is written as `funcContext._outputPipe.Add(item)`.\r\n\r\nConversely, a pipeline is generated as a direct call to `PipelineOps.InvokePipeline` containing all of the pipeline elements (command names, arguments, etc) as raw expressions to be evaluated by that method. There is not an existing concise way (afaik) of spinning up a pipeline without an initial pipeline element and adding to it's input incrementally as the method execution continues (without behavioral changes).\r\n\r\nThat's not to say that it's not possible to add that, but it would take a considerable amount of effort in what is probably the most complicated part of the code base to make happen. Plus the grammar changes that @jhoneill brings up. The workaround of `& { }` is imo pretty ideal as far as workarounds go.\r\n\r\nSo I would personally say it's not worth the effort required.",
