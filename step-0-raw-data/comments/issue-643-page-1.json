That would be a disaster.\n\nThere are only two places that I'm aware of where this is actually built: SCX and DSC.\n\nBoth are fairly light-weight projects. If you just did a \"configure --enable-ulinux; make\" in SCXcore, you'd get what you needed. But if you were willing to check out SCXcore, I could give you a few targeted commands to JUST build OMI.\n\nIs that enough for you? Or do you need something more?\n\nWhat if you took any of the output packages up on the build share for SCX, and ran the shell bundle with `--extract`. If you did this, you'd get an up-to-date version of OMI as well (from the master branch).\n\nI'd suggest you stop by, tell me exactly what you need, and I'll work with you to satisfy your needs.\n",
