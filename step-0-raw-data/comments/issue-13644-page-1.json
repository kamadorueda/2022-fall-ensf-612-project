    "body": "Dang @SteveL-MSFT, I recently added several `PSDrive`s to my profile - what a cool and really useful feature!  Then I discovered that they don't work for other command line tools like `git`.  I can use `git log (Convert-Path MyDrive:\\src\\Test.csproj)`, but who wants to always remember to wrap parens around the path and pass it to `Convert-Path`?  I was about to throw in the towel and then I saw your PR to add this experimental feature, turned it on and voila - it works as one would expect it to (within the confines of a PowerShell session).  Then I saw it had been removed for 7.3.  So disappointing.  I get it that you can only support so many different features and have to prioritize based on usage.  Is there is any way you could justify keeping it around as an experimental feature (and document the edge cases to mitigate confusion)?",
