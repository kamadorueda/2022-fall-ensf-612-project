First I created a simple PowerShell script:\r\n```\r\n# sessiontest.ps1\r\nNew-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n    Port              = 2222\r\n    UserName          = 'administrator'\r\n    HostName          = 'x.x.x.x'\r\n    KeyFilePath       = '/home/user/.ssh/id_myidentity'\r\n    ConnectingTimeout = 30000    # 30 seconds\r\n} -PipelineVariable session | Write-Verbose -Message {\"We got session $_\"} -Verbose | Remove-PSSession -Session {$session}\r\n```\r\nThen I ran the script 10 times from Bash command line:\r\n`for i in {1..10}; do echo \"Loop ${i}:\"; pwsh -file ~/sessiontest.ps1; done`\r\n\r\n**Expected result**\r\n`New-PSSession` command succeeds every time.\r\n```\r\nLoop 1:\r\nVERBOSE: We got session [PSSession]Runspace1\r\n...\r\nLoop 10:\r\nVERBOSE: We got session [PSSession]Runspace1\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Actual result**\r\n`New-PSSession` command fails randomly. Based on the error message some of the hash table keys had no effect or got replaced with default value. In this sample, only loop 3 successfully connected, while loops 1,2,4,5,6,7,8,10 failed due to wrong port, and loop 9 failed due to wrong identity. Repeated executions of the bash command gave similar results but with different loops failing every time.\r\n```\r\nLoop 1:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: ssh: connect to\r\n     | host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out.\r\n\r\nLoop 2:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: ssh: connect to\r\n     | host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out.\r\n\r\nLoop 3:\r\nVERBOSE: We got session [PSSession]Runspace1\r\nLoop 4:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: ssh: connect to\r\n     | host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out.\r\n\r\nLoop 5:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: ssh: connect to\r\n     | host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out.\r\n\r\nLoop 6:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: ssh: connect to\r\n     | host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out.\r\n\r\nLoop 7:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: ssh: connect to\r\n     | host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out.\r\n\r\nLoop 8:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: ssh: connect to\r\n     | host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out.\r\n\r\nLoop 9:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message:\r\n     | user@x.x.x.x: Permission denied (publickey)..\r\n\r\nLoop 10:\r\nNew-PSSession: /home/user/sessiontest.ps1:1\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  New-PSSession -SSHConnection @{\r\n     |  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | [x.x.x.x] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: ssh: connect to\r\n     | host x.x.x.x port 22: Connection timed out.\r\n```\r\nFinally, I ran the same setup from my WSL2 Ubuntu w/ PowerShell 7.2.1 against another server and results were just as random as with the original system.\r\n",

Based on my small sample, it seems to be weighted towards `Port` being ignored but there is also one failure caused by ignored `KeyFilePath`.\r\n\r\nThe test was run from outside `pwsh` using `bash`'s loop syntax. Thus, new `pwsh` process was started for each iteration and exited immediately after. The PowerShell portion of the test also removed each successfull connection before exiting.\r\n\r\nThe server I'm testing this on can handle 100+ outbound ssh connections without issues. I've ran lots of PowerShell commands against large groups of servers simultaneously using splatting syntax with the same hash table and it works just fine.\r\n\r\nAnd let's not forget the timeout issue. In the hash table the `ConnectingTimeout` must be explicitly defined to be non-zero or the connection will fail immediately due to default timeout being 0 milliseconds.",
