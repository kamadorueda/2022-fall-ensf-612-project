    "body": "> Would that be beneficial? If you autocomplete `notepad.exe` you don't get very useful tooltip information.\r\n\r\nThat's because `notepad.exe` isn't part of PowerShell.  You do on the other hand still get the complete path to `notepad.exe` in the tooltip.  I think something in the tooltip needs to let the user know that this is the keyword, vs the function.  Some functions do not show anything in their tooltip, so if both functions and keywords both showed nothing in the tooltip it might be slightly confusing, however, at least a command with the same name as a keyword requires the `&` and that will show when its selected.\r\n\r\nInterestingly I see the operators are already included in completions, and they have tooltips.\r\n\r\nAny data kept on whether these keywords are available, or better, available in a given context?  I would think that reserved keywords should probably not have completions offered, so that a user doesn't have as much clutter to sort through, and keywords that are not available in the current context should not be offered.   \r\n\r\nI suppose that last part is what has kept keyword completion from being implemented so far.",
