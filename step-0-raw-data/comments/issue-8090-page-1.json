    "body": "There are a couple of duplicate issue related to not respecting NewtonSoft JSON attributes and other attributes. The crux of the issue is that unless the object is a primitive, dictionary, or JObject, it hits this code path \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/0a4f33a872ab811d55ff0f255d87035dbf137fb2/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/ConvertToJsonCommand.cs#L398\r\n\r\nThe means that's the object gets converted to a dictionary and then converted to JSON by NewtonSoft.\r\n\r\nMuch of this is legacy baggage from Windows PowerShell from before NewtonSoft was used. We can add attribute detection and change the behavior, but, that might lead to unexpected changes in reestablished behavior and it would definitely be reinventing the wheel.\r\n\r\nI think what really should be done is that new Convert(To|From)-JSON cmdlets should written to more closely wrap NewtonSoft. It will lead to better support for these kinds of things, improve performance, and allow for this project to step out of the JSON (de)serialization business. Then deprecate the exiting cmdlets. ",
