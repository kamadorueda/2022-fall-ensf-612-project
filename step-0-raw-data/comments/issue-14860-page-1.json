Also a concern with side effects with other reparse point types so suggestion was to wrap this as an experimental feature",

Now the bug is fixed in .Net 5.0.\r\nSo we can close #9246 as external and fixed in .Net 5.0 (PowerShell 7.1).\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nHow we work with OneDrive it is _another_ issue. \r\nPreviously we enhanced how we enumerate a file system to support OneDrive (and AppExecLink too). It was in IsReparsePointWithTarget() method.\r\nMore later discussion with @rjmholt is in #11331\r\n\r\nI think current fix is not right - we should change a behavior only for **non-named surrogates** - and this can not be a breaking change - it should be classified as new behavior or bug fix.\r\n\r\nRight fix is to use IsReparsePointWithTarget() and get the same behavior for OneDrive as for regular directory.
