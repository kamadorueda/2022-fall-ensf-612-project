    "body": "I'm using Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK but I got some further about the investigation of this. You are more or less right about the PSModulePath but together with this it seems to me that for Powershell 7 and probably 6 you need to create a runspace. \r\nFor PowerShell 5 this was not necessary and all you had to do was\r\n\r\n     using (var powerShell = PowerShell.Create())\r\n     {\r\n           powerShell.AddScript(<yourscript>).Invoke();\r\n     }\r\n\r\nBut for PowerShell 7 (and probably 6) you need to create a runspace, At least this works for me. \r\n\r\n               using (var runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace())\r\n                {\r\n                    runspace.Open();\r\n\r\n                    var proxy = runspace.SessionStateProxy;\r\n\r\n                    using (var ps = PowerShell.Create())\r\n                    {\r\n                        ps.Runspace = runspace;\r\n\r\n                        ps.AddCommand(\"Get-CimInstance\").AddArgument(\"win32_PnPSignedDriver\");\r\n                        \r\n                        var drivers = ps.Invoke().ToList();\r\n\r\n                        foreach (var driver in drivers)\r\n                        {\r\n                            Console.WriteLine(driver.Members[\"Description\"].Value);\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\nThe next thing is to make sure that the modules path is available in the environment variable PSModulePath. But the values in the PSModulePath in windows and when queried in powershell are different. So it wont help to add the path in Windows->Environment Variables->PSModulePath. You need to do it programmatically. \r\n\r\n    var psModulePath = proxy.GetVariable(\"env:PSModulePath\");\r\n    proxy.SetVariable(\"env:PSModulePath\", $@\"{psModulePath};C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7-preview\\Modules\");\r\n\r\nIt also seems that the PSModulePath is automatically populated with the path your .exe is running from. If you print out \r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine($\"PSModulePath environmentvariable:  {proxy.GetVariable(\"env:PSModulePath\")}\");\r\n\r\nyou will see that this contains (\r\n\r\n- C:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules;\r\n- C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\Modules;\r\n- **c:\\users\\username\\appdata\\local\\temp\\\\.net\\appname\\e2dw1dvd.tkt\\Modules;**\r\n- C:\\Windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\r\n\r\nSo by adding the Modules folder to your application you can make it self-contained without the need for adding a path to the environment variable. Note that this path for me is a temp path cause I'm running it on a remote computer with psexec. \r\n\r\nProbably there is a bug that these variables differ. \r\n\r\nMy next issue is that the powershell commands does not work on windows 7. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
