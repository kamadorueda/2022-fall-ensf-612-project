If the name provided matches multiple entries, **and** the names of the returned entries are identical, then\r\n2. The most up to date (by version I suppose) entry should be automatically selected. Otherwise,\r\n3. Return to current behaviour (allow multiple entries to be displayed when there is more than one match).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we should probably expose the version of the module that this help is coming from so as to provide a way to distinguish the files, _and_ provide a way for Get-Help to target a specific version should it be required.",

    "body": "I took a look at this and unfortunately it's not so straightforward to fix.  The problem is that as help is discovered, it is emitted.  Since we don't know the order before hand if there are dupes, we don't know which of the duplicates is the right one to show until we have the full results.  If we change this to a synchronous model where we filter first before displaying, then this breaks the current user experience where they see found results as they are found.  This means that if there is a large set of results, you wouldn't see anything until the very end (we'd add a progress bar I suppose).\r\n\r\nAssuming we agree to break the user experience, there isn't any version information related to the module in updateable help.  The help content is stored in a `Help` folder.  In the case of PSReadLine, you have one under your personal `powershell\\help` folder and the other in `<modulepath>\\help`.  I think it makes sense to prefer the updateable help version in the case of a dupe, but we still have the problem #1 above.\r\n\r\nIn the case where you have multiple versions of the same module in different places that have local help that gets found by the helpsystem, it would probably make sense to show the one from the path where the module is imported.\r\n\r\nAll of this is not a small change.  Moving out of 7.1 as I don't see such changes making it in time.",
