    "body": "Yea, no argument that needing an empty username with basic auth is an edge case (ha, not the only peculiarity I'm dealing with for this API...).\r\n\r\nI didn't realize that you shouldn't be able to make a `PSCredential` with a `$null` username? If you're not supposed to be able to create a `PSCredential` with a $null username, then I don't see any reason to handle the above scenario in the web cmdlets. \r\n\r\nIt seems like you should be able to create a `PSCredential` with a `$null` username, but that sounds more like a design choice than a bug. I could see something like `Get-Credential -AllowNullUsername` or something, as well as a `PSCredential` constructor that just takes a `SecureString`.\r\n\r\nThe counter argument would be that a `PSCredential` with a `$null` username is really just a `SecureString`. It seems more secure to keep the password in a `PSCredential` and pass that variable to various cmdlets instead of decrypting the password, storing it in an intermediary variable unencrypted (and consequently memory), and then passing it as a parameter.\r\n\r\nHopefully that makes sense.",
