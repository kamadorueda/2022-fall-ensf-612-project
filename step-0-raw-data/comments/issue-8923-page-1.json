    "body": "@TylerLeonhardt The design of this feels very awkward.\r\n\r\nIf I want to set a breakpoint inside of a runspace, I'm instinctively going to look for a `-Runspace` parameter in `Set-PSBreakpoint`. I'm not going to think: \"First I need to create a new breakpoint object, and then once that is created, I need to invoke `Debug-Runspace -Breakpoint $myBreakpoint`\". The former feels like how the rest of PowerShell works. The latter feels like how lower-level programming APIs work.\r\n\r\nWhat's stopping us from taking the more intuitive, PowerShell-like approach with the addition of a `-Runspace` parameter in `Set-PSBreakpoint`, discarding `New-PSBreakpoint` as it shouldn't be necessary, and leaving `Debug-Runspace` as is?\r\n\r\nFrom a programming standpoint, creating a new breakpoint object and then passing it into a runspace via API is fine...just not from PowerShell. Having both `New-PSBreakpoint` and `Set-PSBreakpoint` is bound to cause confusion, becauses suddenly it is no longer clear what cmdlet you should use to create a breakpoint, when it should be evident what you need to use. I say all of this as someone who does the vast majority of their debugging from the command line in the native console, even in vscode.",

    "body": "Another question about this part:\r\n\r\n>The reason it's not great is due to the BreakAll feature of PowerShell debugging which, when you run Debug-Runspace, will break at the first piece of code that gets run. This is not ideal when you \"Attach to process\" and then run your code in the other runspace.\r\n> \r\n> Today, the experience drops you in PSReadLine's psm1 if PSRL is available or in the vscode PowerShell helper psm1.\r\n\r\nIt shouldn't be possible to enter into the PSReadLine `psm1` file or any of the vscode PowerShell helper `psm1` files. Those modules should be marked with the `[System.Diagnostics.DebuggerHidden()]` attribute so that the debugger has nothing to do with them. So while I agree we should support breakpoints in runspaces, attaching the debugger to a runspace with `BreakAll` should naturally have a better experience by nature of the debugger only stopping on code that it is allowed to stop on. I say this knowing full well that there are some issues with `DebuggerHidden` in PowerShell, but we need to get to the bottom of those issues and get them fixed so that the debugger doesn't confuse users by bringing them into code that they should otherwise have nothing to do with.",

    "body": "FWIW, I dug into the code behind this to see what could be done, and an approach I started putting together looks something like the following (it's not done yet, just in progress in an experimental branch that is local on my machine right now):\r\n\r\n1. Define a Runspace transformation attribute that converts a string (name), int (id), or guid (instance id) into a collection of runspaces. Reasoning: To avoid parameter set bloat by allowing `*-PSBreakpoint` cmdlets that already have multiple parameter sets to have a single `-Runspace` parameter on all parameter sets that uses this transform and covers all bases for how you might want to refer to a runspace.\r\n1. Add a `-Runspace` parameter to `Get-PSBreakpoint`, `Set-PSBreakpoint`, and `Remove-PSBreakpoint` for breakpoint management in runspaces. This approach allows me to set a breakpoint in a runspace that is running without entering the debugger to do so, after which I can use `Get-Runspace` to check the status of my runspaces and see when the breakpoint gets hit (a very useful and necessary feature for debugging).\r\n1. Remove the `-Breakpoint` parameter from `Debug-Runspace`.\r\n1. Remove the `New-PSBreakpoint` command.\r\n\r\nIMHO this approach will be much easier for users to adopt and use.",

    "body": "@TylerLeonhardt: FYI, I'm making good progress on this, but I have something I need help with.\r\n\r\n`Enable-/Disable-/Remove-PSBreakpoint` all have a `-Breakpoint` parameter that accepts pipeline input. If I retrieve a breakpoint from a specific runspace and pipe that into one of those commands, I need to know the runspace (really I need the `ScriptDebugger`, but I can get that from the runspace) they come from. But if I add the runspace, or the `ScriptDebugger` directly as I had originally thought I would do, it will break the rehydration that those objects support today. Instead I can work around this by storing the runspace instanceid in the breakpoint, since that would allow rehydration to continue to work, and from that guid I can get the runspace and then update the breakpoint accordingly when one is passed in via pipeline input.\r\n\r\nIf I go for job support as well, I could also store the job instance id on the breakpoint as well, so that I can pipe breakpoints that I'm managing in a job, and have the runspace instance id for use within that job to set the breakpoint accordingly.\r\n\r\nDoes that make sense? Any problems you forsee with this approach before I go down this path?",

I believe this will meet Tyler’s needs, but we need to ensure all scenarios are covered.  I don’t think it is necessary to update the Breakpoint type to include RunspaceId property.  It think it is an unlikely scenario to pass breakpoint via pipeline over a remote session.  For local use, passing via pipeline is likely and in this case we can simply append a note property to the Breakpoint type, that the updated cmdlets will recognize. \r\n>\r\n> Changing the Breakpoint type creates remoting compatibility issues that I would like to avoid.",

Here's where I'm at right now:\r\n\r\n1. There is a remote debugging protocol that defines how PowerShell debugging should work remotely, and it needs to be updated (the version and the document), to ensure backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\n    I had been looking for this document in the repository, but couldn't find it. Then I found it [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-psrdp/).\r\n\r\n    Is this in GitHub somewhere, so that updates can be added and the document versioned in a GitHub repository, and then the pdf/docx files get generated from markdown? Or is this something you gentlemen manage internally?\r\n\r\n1. Is the reason you are proposing that we extend the protocol and add the new messages to allow breakpoints to be set in remote script debuggers is so that someone can then use that protocol definition to communicate with a remote script debugger and do the same, independent of the PowerShell runtime? If so, can you give me an example where this is done?\r\n\r\n1. Today we have `GetBreakpoint` and `GetBreakpoints` public methods on a remote debugger that invoke corresponding `GetBreakpoint` and `GetBreakpoints` methods on the remote runspace debugger. Why don't these also work through messages sent to the remote script debugger via an extension to the remote debugging protocol? Or, the flipside: why not just expose abstract `Set*Breakpoint` methods on the `Breakpoint` base class, and then override them in other classes that derive from `Debugger`? i.e. Why do we want to _get_ breakpoints via method invocation and _set_ breakpoints via the remote debugging protocol?\r\n\r\nIf those questions don't make sense, please let me know.",

When @TylerLeonhardt implemented this PR, one of the changes he made was to add `GetBreakpoint` and `GetBreakpoints` as abstract methods in the abstract base `Breakpoint` class. Since those recent additions were added that way, that is why I was asking where you draw the line on when to implement as methods that don't go over the wire via the MS-PSRDP, and when to go that route, adding to `PreProcessDebuggerCommand`.\r\n\r\n@TylerLeonhardt, based on what I've heard from Paul here, it sounds like `GetBreakpoint` and `GetBreakpoints` should also be extensions to the MS-PSRDP and pull breakpoints from a remote debugger via `PreProcessDebuggerCommand` additions instead of using the changes you made in this PR that extended the base class with abstract methods. Please let me know if you agree, because if so, I'll go ahead and make those changes.",

That enumeration value isn't used anywhere (i.e. it's functionally equivalent to `PreProcessCommandResult.None`), so when it is returned from `PreProcessDebuggerCommand`, it just bypasses the switch statement, so `terminateImmediate` remains set to `false`, resulting in the command running through the runspace.",

    "body": "Hey @PaulHigin, I was trying to get this PR submitted today, but stumbled upon an ugly bug in how breakpoints are handled that got in the way. I want to fix that bug as part of the PR I'm working on. It's a pretty weird bug, and definitely needs fixing.\r\n\r\nHere's a repro scenario that works in 5.1 and 6.2.1 that should work in 7 preview as well:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create a job that writes a bunch of different types of stream data\r\n$job = Start-Job -ScriptBlock {\r\n    1..1000 | ForEach-Object {\r\n        Start-Sleep -Seconds 1\r\n        $_\r\n        Write-Error 'boo'\r\n        Write-Verbose 'Verbose' -Verbose\r\n        $DebugPreference = 'Continue'\r\n        Write-Debug 'Debug'\r\n        Write-Warning 'Warning'\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n# Set a local breakpoint on the Get-Process command\r\nSet-PSBreakpoint -Command Get-Process\r\n\r\n# Take note that the breakpoint with ID 0 is a command breakpoint for Get-Process\r\n\r\n# Debug the job\r\nDebug-Job -Job $job\r\n\r\n# In your nested debugger, create a breakpoint inside of the job that triggers when the DebugPreference variable is written\r\nSet-PSBreakpoint -Variable DebugPreference\r\n\r\n# Detach your debugger\r\nd\r\n\r\n# Now that you're back in your main PowerShell runspace, have a look at your breakpoints\r\nGet-PSBreakpoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason this happens is because of an event loop. The `ScriptDebugger.HandleBreakpointUpdated` event handler is added to job debuggers and nested debuggers, and when you set or remove a breakpoint from inside a job debugger or a nested debugger, the event handler fires, internally invoking the corresponding set or remove breakpoint _on the parent `ScriptDebugger`_. This means breakpoints you set or remove in a child debugging session will result in updates to breakpoints with the same IDs in the parent debugger, even if those are not the same breakpoints at all. This is obviously incorrect, and I'm sure this has made someone scratch their head a few times. Enable and disable don't have the same effect, because they just enable or disable the breakpoint object that was already enabled or disabled, again.\r\n\r\nWhat I could use some help on here is how best to solve it. What was the original intent behind having a job or nested debugger trigger an event handler in a parent `ScriptDebugger` instance? With the changes I'm making, users will be able to manage breakpoints in one debugger independently from another, so I tend to think that there is really no need for the `ScriptDebugger.HandleBreakpointUpdated` event handler at all, but I don't have the history behind what is there now to understand what was supposed to happen. Can you share some of the backstory behind the intent here so that I can confirm whether or not removing this event handler is the right thing to do?\r\n\r\nPlease give this a look and let me know how you feel I should proceed as soon as you can.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\ncc: @TylerLeonhardt ",

I've pushed another PR on the side because I felt getting this corrected (the design of this functionality and the issues in its implementation) were more important than finishing up tests on the other PR work.\r\n\r\nNow you want to put all of that work on hold _when I'm just about to submit a PR_, slam on the brakes, and push it through the terribly slow RFC process, where I have many, many RFCs that just are not progressing, throwing my efforts to get some of these things corrected and into PowerShell 7 out the door completely? Thanks but no thanks.\r\n\r\nThe original work @TylerLeonhardt did skipped the RFC process, and was merged. Now here we are with me having finished my dev work, but I found a bug that should be looked at, so I reached out because I can't make assumptions about why the existing implementation is there, and I don't have the luxury of being on your team to talk directly to you about this, so I ask questions here. I know that interrupts your other work. I'm trying to help you guys, and PowerShell as a whole (the product and the community). You're making it really hard for me to do that.\r\n\r\ncc: @SteveL-MSFT",

PRs are fine for small scope changes, but I feel this has gone beyond that and we need step back and think carefully about what we want to do and how to move forward.\r\n\r\nI know that RFCs are a slow process, but really it is meant to be so that we don't make decisions we later regret.  \r\n\r\nAlso, I have other high priority work to do so I cannot always be as responsive as I would like.\r\n\r\nRegarding RFCs, I find that smaller, well scoped, clear and concise writing gets better and quicker responses.  Verbose writing is harder to parse and understand.  Large scope changes are harder approve since it is difficult to think through all implications, including compatibility and documentation.  In general I prefer incremental changes where possible.",

    "body": "Just to add… the original scope of this work was to _make the VSCode extension better_ by providing APIs (as in PowerShell’s C# API) for managing breakpoints.\r\n\r\nWe expanded on that by exposing a few additions to cmdlets so that folks debugging from the CLI could take advantage of these features - thus `New-PSBreakpoint` and the `-Breakpoint` param were born.\r\n\r\nUpon seeing @KirkMunro’s original thoughts on cmdlet design, I agreed that `New-PSBreakpoint` was probably less “PowerShelly” compared to `Set-PSBreakpoint -Runspace` and @PaulHigin and I both felt like that’s probably the better way to go and @KirkMunro took that and ran with it.\r\n\r\nAs @KirkMunro continued this work, it’s clear that there are edge cases in the debugging stack. That’s not surprising - it’s a piece of software.\r\n\r\nI personally think that we should not include any bug fixes with this change and instead, should address bug fixes in a separate PR so to make the size of the PR that adds this feature smaller.\r\n\r\nThe PR should only:\r\n* give the vscode extension an API to manage breakpoints in other runspaces\r\n* give a simple cmdlet experience so that users of the CLI can do similar breakpoint management in other runspaces.\r\n\r\n> give the vscode extension an API to manage breakpoints in other runspaces\r\n\r\nThis is why we didn’t originally open an RFC for this is because the extension _needs_ this functionality to act in the way other language debuggers in vscode do.
