Clearly the problem is that we would have to remove the `VERBOSE: ` string that is always pre-pended but then one would not see whether it is a verbose message or not. Or is it better to rather add the `-NoNewline` switch to `Write-Information` instead? Similar problems with pre-pended text apply to `Write-Debug` and `Write-Warning`. What are your thoughts?",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT  @bergmeister @StingyJack `Write-Verbose`, `Write-Debug` etc are not at _all_ like the `Write()`, `WriteLine()` methods in .NET. `Write-Verbose` (`Error`, `Debug`, etc.) write objects to the host application which then decides what to do with them. In the console host, it currently prefixes the string with VERBOSE: and then writes it to the console. A graphical host might pop up a dialog instead.  Also consider the impact of action preferences on their presentation. For example:\r\n```\r\nPS[1] (7) > Write-Debug -debug \"A debug message\"\r\nDEBUG: A debug message\r\n\r\nConfirm\r\nContinue with this operation?\r\n[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [H] Halt Command  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is \"Y\"):\r\n```\r\nThere is essentially a complete separation between what is written and how it is rendered. So it really doesn't make sense to have `-NoNewline` for `Write-Verbose` because there is no guarantee that it will simply be written to the \"console\". For that purpose, you would use `Write-Host -NoNewline` as in\r\n```\r\nwrite-host -NoNewline \"Hi there\" -ForegroundColor yellow\r\n```\r\n\r\n@fvanroie \r\n> I came accross the same issue, wanting to update log messages on the same line, as the cmdlet progresses. This would be a nice feature indeed.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what we have `Write-Progress` for. Does it not work for your scenarios?\r\n",

    "body": "> This is exactly what we have Write-Progress for. Does it not work for your scenarios?\r\n\r\n `$global:ProgressPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'` ends up in most of my scripts as Write-Progress seems to just slow things down.  Perhaps its just that modules misuse it. \r\n\r\n> For that purpose, you would use Write-Host...\r\n\r\nYes and have to listen to every cargo cult parrot - and PSScriptAnalyzer - tell me how awful I am for using Write-Host. I like _less_ aggravation. More importantly, I dont want a script or module emitting verbose messages all the time, I just want them emitted when i ask for them.  Write-Host doesn't do that.\r\n\r\n> A graphical host might pop up a dialog instead. Also consider the impact of action preferences on their presentation. \r\n\r\nIf the calling application is not a console, it has already got some kind of handling for displaying the output streams. Along with the ability to display a stream, comes the responsibility of rendering it sensibly.   If someone makes an application that shows a popup for every verbose message, they deserve that special place in hell where they must play \"punch the monkey\" but can never win.\r\n",
