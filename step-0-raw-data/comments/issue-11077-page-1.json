    "body": "Also note that the distinction between arrays and scalar is often unproblematic in PowerShell, because it allows you to treat scalars _as if they were_ arrays; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$var = 42 # scalar\r\n\r\n$var.Count  # -> 1 - a scalar is a \"collection of 1\"\r\n\r\n$var[0] # -> 42 - a scalar's \"first collection element\" is the scalar itself\r\n\r\n$var[-1] # -> 42 - a scalar's \"last collection element\" is the scalar itself\r\n```\r\n\r\nPitfalls:\r\n\r\n* Indexing a scalar `[string]` instance indexes into its _character array_ instead; e.g., `'foo'[0]` is `'f'`\r\n\r\n* Calling `.Count` on lazy `IEnumerable`s (which don't have a `.Count` property) forces enumeration and then reports `1` _for each enumerated (scalar) object_ (unless  they happen to have a `.Count` property themselves); e.g., `([IO.File]::ReadLines(\"$pwd/file.txt\")).Count` reports `1` for each line of the input file.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nConversely, you can use the \"array guarantor\" operator (array-subexpression operator), `@(...)`, to ensure that a scalar becomes an array:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$var = 42 # scalar\r\n\r\n# @(...) ensures that $var is treated as an array.\r\n# If $var already *is* an array, @(...) is - loosely speaking - a no-op (see pitfall below).\r\n@($var).GetType().FullName  # -> System.Object[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, if you're capturing output from a command or expression in a variable,  a simpler alternative is to type-constrain the variable with `[array]` (effectively the same as `System.Object[]`):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[array] $arr = 42   # $arr is now a single-element array of type System.Object[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nPitfall:\r\n\r\n* `@(...)` technically _always_<sup>[1]</sup> creates a _new_ array of type `System.Object[]`.\r\n\r\n  * With _command_ output (e.g., `Get-ChildItem`), this makes no difference (`System.Object[]` is the array type PowerShell uses anyway when it collects _multiple_ outputs from the pipeline for you, such as when assigning command output to a variable.\r\n\r\n  * However, if you wrap something that _already is an array in memory_ in `@(...)`, you not only needlessly create a new array, but its specific typing may be lost; e.g., `@([int[]] (1..3)).GetType().FullName` yields `System.Object[]`, despite the `[int[]]`-typed input array.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<sup>[1] There is one exception: Array _literals_: Because needlessly constructing array literals as `@( 1, 2 )` - instead of just `1 , 2` (the use of array-construction operator `,`  is enough) - was such a widespread practice, starting in v5.1 the `@( ... )` is optimized away, so as to avoid constructing an array _twice_.</sup>\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Therefore, there is no difference between sending a _scalar_ (single object) and sending a _single-element array_ through the pipeline.\r\n\r\n* On output, multiple objects are simply output one at a time (though it is possible, but rare, to send an array _as a whole_, but it is then itself just another, single output object in the pipeline).\r\n\r\nIt is only when you _collect_ a pipeline's output that arrays come into play, of necessity:\r\n\r\n* A single output object needs no container, and can just be received as itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Multiple objects need a container, and PowerShell automatically creates a `System.Object[]` array to collect the output objects in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<sup>[1] You can introduce _buffering_ of multiple objects with the common `-OutBuffer` parameter, but the next command in a pipeline still receives the buffered objects one by one.</sup>",
