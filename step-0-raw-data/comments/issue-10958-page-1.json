Ugh.\r\n\r\nGive me a clean, forward thinking break with `psd2` files already and be done with the duck taped `psd1` file format. Plus, hello, `PowerShellVersion` is checked first in recent versions of PS, so this could be moved forward with `psd1` files.\r\n\r\nThe current mandate to leave `psd1` files in legacy mode for backward compatibility and discard any possible enhancements to make them better, with the argument that `psm1` files can be used to deal with the extra stuff is really getting old. `psm1` files should only be necessary for scenarios when a manifest can't describe a module in a declarative way, which they should be able to do for binary modules and modules composed of a bunch of `ps1` files most of the time.",
