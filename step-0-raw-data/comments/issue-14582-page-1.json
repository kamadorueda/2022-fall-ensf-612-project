So it's calling `Type.GetInterfaces` (an abstract method) instead of `RuntimeType.GetInterfaces`.\r\n\r\nThat said, I didn't think the binder was supposed to enforce that unless the explicit cast was either a parent class in a PS class (emulating `base.Method()`) or an interface (for invoking explicitly implemented interface methods).",
