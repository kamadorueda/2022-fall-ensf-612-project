For example, `Get-Content` could have a transcript mode that colorizes strings starting with `DEBUG:`, `VERBOSE:` etc....  Or `ConvertTo-Html` could also have special logic to understand transcripts and output color.\r\n\r\nTranscription currently makes an effort to not preserve color and I'm not sure if preserving the ANSI escape sequences really solves your specific problem as they would only be useful viewed in a terminal that understands ANSI.",
