Once it's an array, it's a fixed-size collection and cannot be modified.",

So it does, to comply with the interface. However, the interface only states it has to support the method, not that the method needs to _work_.\r\n\r\nThere's another IList member that it implements, you'll note that there's an `IsFixedSize` member property in your Get-Member result there; the expectation is that if `IsFixedSize` is `true`, the `Add()` and similar methods are expected to throw / error out instead of doing something to the list.",

Sometimes design patterns that make a lot of sense in C# are going to be surfaced in PowerShell in a really unavoidably bad way, there's not much that can really be done about it.  I wish when they were initially designing the binder they required a cast to access explicitly implemented members, but they already didn't do that.  Unfortunately if they changed it to work like that now it would be a pretty large breaking change.",
