(And, as I said, if `-Force` will no longer be required to remove a directory symlink, no one will get to see that confusing error message anyway.)\r\n\r\n> It appears that at some point the cmdlet was changed to bring it more in line with the Windows `mklink` and Unix `ln` commands, allowing a symbolic link to be created that linked to a non-existent item. In making that change, the ability to create directory symbolic links to existing directories was (presumably) inadvertently lost.\r\n\r\nThat sounds like a promising lead: see [this commit](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/804) (@andschwa).\r\n\r\n> there should be some conversation around whether (and how) a user should be able to deliberately create a \"file\" symbolic link to a directory with New-Item\r\n\r\nExcellent point: ~~If you're creating a symlink to a non-existing item, in the absence of knowing that not-yet-extant item's _type_,~~ on _Windows_ you must specify whether it is a _file_ or _directory_ - and there's currently no way to specify that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@joeyaiello Honestly, I don't know why someone would want to create a file-type symbolic link to a directory. Windows allows the `mklink` command to do so---in fact it is the default behavior unless the `/D` option is explicitly given---so presumably someone thought at one time that it would be useful.\r\n\r\nUnix doesn't have the notion of a separate directory-type symbolic link, so new enums for `DirectorySymbolicLink` and `FileSymbolicLink` would be meaningless for Linux and OS X. The Linux implementation of `ln` has a `-d` switch for creating directory _hard_ links, but that's pretty much never actually allowed, even for the superuser. Combining the `-d` switch with the `-s` switch (even on an NTFS volume) simply ignores the `-d` and creates a \"normal\" sym link. The OS X version of `ln` does not even offer the option.",
