People who came from bash/zsh/fish will do this.\r\n\r\nI'd like to add, this difference in mindsets comes from the fact that commands in UNIX land (unlike PowerShell) are usually already short enough that you won't need to alias them.  So the primary use case indeed is for stacking up some commonly used arguments.\r\n\r\nThis one might as well be my [favorite one](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/e32d4b1e195f4c7777844beea97af42bd93434eb/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh#L204):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nalias glola=\"git log --graph --pretty='%Cred%h%Creset -%C(auto)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --all\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n@doctordns",
