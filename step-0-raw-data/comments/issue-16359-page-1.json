It is the group's consensus that although the requested feature is potentially useful, it does not reach the threshold for committing resources that would be required to implement it.\r\nAdditional parameters of this kind can often be implemented as Proxy Functions and the code shown on the issue could be used as the basis of a community-supported proxy function, which can be delivered from the PowerShell Gallery. When items in the gallery generate a significant positive response the PowerShell committee and/or working groups may reconsider whether they should form part of the main the PowerShell repo.",
