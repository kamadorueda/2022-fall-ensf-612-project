YMMV. \r\n\r\n@JamesWTruher @joeyaiello IIRC, the thrust of what we discussed in the committee meeting is that PowerShell would call `Console.Clear()` on all 'console' platforms and the CoreCLR team would implement the appropriate behaviour on each platform.  If the CoreCLR isn't doing the right thing on a platform, then a bug should be opened in the CoreCLR repo.  ***BUT(!) we do still need to go through the `$Host.UI.RawUI` APIs in order to support 'non-console' platforms like remoting.*** In fact, if the `RawUI` APIs were fully supported on non-Windows console hosts, this whole discussion might be moot.\r\n",

A few of them are about scrollback not clearing as expected because of winpty issues. \r\n\r\nFrom reading the history, not clearing scrollback appears to be broken behavior in `libvte` that has persisted. Since the native `clear` is used, that behavior is respected which gives PowerShell the freedom to implement clear properly with scrollback cleared consistently.",
