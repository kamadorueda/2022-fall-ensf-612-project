So less of \"ACL for windows is garbage\" might help you. \r\n\r\nIf you could make an ssh connection to your desired target OUTSIDE PowerShell remoting but it failed in PowerShell it's fair enough to ask PowerShell to fix it.  But you've put the keyfile in a windows folder which won't be acceptable to ssh - so it's not the PowerShell function which is unsuitable - you've ensured you cannot use ssh for anything. \r\n\r\n`icacls \"F:\\Development\\tmp\\private.key\":  /grant 'yourusername:(F)' /inheritance:r `     \r\nshould keep SSH happy whether it is run from powershell or anywhere else\r\n\r\nBefore icacls there was cacls which I think goes back to early Windows NT and possibly OS/2 and there are PowerShell get- and set- -acl commands. So people have been setting acls from the command line and scripts for decades. Is it so hard for your script to set an acl  when it copies a file or put the file somewhere that inherited permissions are acceptable to ssh ?\r\n\r\n",
