    "body": "`Select-String` does fit the description of locating a resource in a container considering it uses wildcard and regex to \"locate\". I guess you could extend that into `Select-Object` because it uses wildcards to \"locate\" properties. However, I agree the definition is incomplete because it is primarily used to reshape objects and choose a subset of properties.\r\n\r\n`Search` and `Find` are both very confusing and too similar in verbs. I would even argue one of those verbs is better than `Select-String`.\r\n\r\nToo many similar verbs and not enough clarity and examples on why they differ is the biggest problem with most of the verbs.",

    "body": "It's worth noting that the original (PowerShell 1 era) verb list specifically said that \"Get\" replaced both \"Search\" and \"Find\" üòâ  but the description for `Search` in particular is just confusing.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I think `Select-String` should have been called `Find-String` ... as evidenced by the fact that it's main use parallels the old `find` command.\r\n\r\nThe key problem I have with the description of `Select` is that this verb is not for locating things. If it were for locating, then surely it would be redundant with `Search`, `Find`, and `Get` üôÅ In fact, it also generally operates on a pipeline, not a container ...  and it's best use is for reshaping, as people are used to using it in many query languages.",
