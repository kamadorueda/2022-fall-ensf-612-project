I came here to raise this as an issue and just 10 minutes earlier, this case had been raised, so chipping in here. \r\n\r\nI'm hitting the problem in PowerShell 7.2.3 when simply piping command line results to `| clip` and wanting to paste these into Teams chats, notepad, etc. E.g.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\u001b[32;1mActiveDirectoryUserName : \u001b[0mDOMAIN\\user\r\n\u001b[32;1mApplicationType         : \u001b[0mDesktop\r\n\u001b[32;1mCreateTime              : \u001b[0m12/05/2022 10:50:43\r\n```",
