    "body": "I think it's broken line continuation after a comment. I can reproduce this simpler case for any trailing binary operator:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n> 1 +\r\n>> 2\r\n3\r\n> 1 +\r\n>> # comment\r\nParserError:\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  1 +\r\n     |     ~\r\n     | You must provide a value expression following the '+' operator.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all cases I am doing shift+enter to continue the line, but after the comment it treats it like I just typed enter.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, it works without problem in a script:\r\n```pwsh\r\n> @\"\r\n>> 1 +\r\n>> 2\r\n>> \"@ | Invoke-Expression\r\n3\r\n> @\"\r\n>> 1 +\r\n>> # comment\r\n>> 2\r\n>> \"@ | Invoke-Expression\r\n3\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo my guess is that one should look like at code handling shift+enter or pasted code specifically, not the interpreter itself.",
