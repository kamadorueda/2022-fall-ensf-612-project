    "body": "> ### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n> Using `Get-ChildItem`, can anyone advise whether it's possible to non-recursively list files where the directory is specified as a LiteralPath and the filename(s) returned must match a given string containing wildcards?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if literalpath is a factor, but unless you expecting the path to contain characters which would be interpreted as Wildcards or escapes of some kind, I'd side step that and just use `Get-ChildItem \"C:\\DirA\\DirB\\*.doc\" -File` with path and wildcarded file name in one.  \r\n\r\n \r\n> if `C:\\DirA\\DirB` contained both `.doc` and `.docx` files then `Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath \"C:\\DirA\\DirB\" -Filter \"*.doc\" -File` would return both.\r\n\r\nThere is a difference between Windows PowerShell 5 (legacy, in-box and not updated via this repo) and PowerShell 7 (current, separate download, suggest changes here). \r\n\r\ncmd.exe matches on the short names (the internal 8.3 names needed by 16 bit programs which we can't run on 64 bit OSes),  try dir /x   and then do something like dir *~1.*  If you have any long names it will find them though normally you don't have ~1 in the name :-)  the extension is truncated at 3 characters so dir *.DOC in cmd matches on .docx. Someone will tell me I'm sure but I can't see how to get those names in PowerShell.  \r\n\r\nI tried to repro what you said, I have one DOC and many DOCX file in the root of my documents folder and \r\n`Get-Childitem -LiteralPath C:\\users\\me\\Documents\\ -Filter *.doc -File`  only returns the doc file but that was on PowerShell 7. When I fired up Windows PowerShell 5.1 - I get the same as you, i.e.  the filter reproduces cmd behaviour in 5 but not in 7 - probably because being cross platform there was no sense bring those things to linux, which was an excuse to call time on some of them for windows. \r\n\r\nOne of those links says file system provider sees \".*\" as \"any file extension including none\" and the wildcard wanting the name_with_any_extension to include a .  - this behaviour does seem to have stayed in 7.  Since directories traditionally didn't have extensions dir *. got just the directories, in pwsh 7 dir *. returns files ending in with \".\" and dir -filter *. gets the old directory listing. \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

Certain providers may have the filtering capability supported in its underlying component, and thus have better performance than the PowerShell wildcard globing. For the built-in providers, currently only the FileSystemProvider supports `-Filter` because .NET API can do this to some extent. Below is copied from the help content of `-Filter` parameter:\r\n> The filter string is passed to the .NET API to enumerate files. The API only supports * and ? wildcards.\r\n\r\nHere is an example for you to get a sense of the perf difference:\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Using PowerShell globing\r\nPS:49> Measure-Command { dir C:\\windows\\System32\\* }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 798\r\nTicks             : 7984646\r\nTotalDays         : 9.24148842592593E-06\r\nTotalHours        : 0.000221795722222222\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.0133077433333333\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.7984646\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 798.4646\r\n\r\n## Using -Filter\r\nPS:50> Measure-Command { dir C:\\windows\\System32\\ -Filter * }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 61\r\nTicks             : 619072\r\nTotalDays         : 7.16518518518519E-07\r\nTotalHours        : 1.71964444444444E-05\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.00103178666666667\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.0619072\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 61.9072\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that, making it do PowerShell wildcard globing will defeat its original purpose.\r\n",
