So your new PR most likely won't be ported back, but this micro-optimization change may be ported back.",

So removing the duplicate sourceCode read from there could potentially be a breaking change if someone was relying on that functionality.  I feel it is an acceptable risk for Core 6 since it is unlikely anyone has a dependency on it.  But for Windows (back porting) it could adversely affect a customer.",
