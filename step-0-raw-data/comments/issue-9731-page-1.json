At one point, functions weren't going to have begin/process/end so there would be no way of  writing _functions_ that streamed. As a partial mitigation, I proposed the `Filter` keyword as a way to allow at least some stream processing. When we eventually did add begin/process/end, we really should have removed \"filter\". It just confuses people).",

    "body": "What's missing is any semblance of decent performance with ForEach-Object. Compared to an ad hoc function-style filter, it is extremely slow. \r\n\r\nThe fact that an ad hoc filter function can outstrip it by such large margins should be a pretty big red flag for the code that is used in ForEach-Object. Some additional overhead may be warranted, but not to this degree, surely.\r\n\r\nThere are other issues about this, which I'll happily dig up later if you need me to.",

    "body": "Performance of `ForEach-Object` can be significantly improved without really touching the parameter binder.\r\n\r\nOne option is to rewrite the pipeline - see how `| Out-Null` is special cased, you can make similar changes to handle **limited** uses of `ForEach-Object`, e.g. if you have a single literal scriptblock argument, you could rewrite the pipeline to not use `ForeEach-Object` and instead invoke the scriptblock as a filter.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could create a special parameter binder that has special knowledge about `ForEach-Object`.
