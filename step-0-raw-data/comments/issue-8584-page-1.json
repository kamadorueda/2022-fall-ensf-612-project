    "body": "Looking at the documentation, it says something interesting: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_automatic_variables?view=powershell-6#input\r\n\r\n>In the Process block of a function, the $input variable enumerates the object that is currently in the pipeline. When the Process block completes, there are no objects left in the pipeline, so the $input variable enumerates an empty collection.\r\n\r\nThis wording is a bit unclear, but it _seems_ to be saying that `$Input` isn't a static value, even in the `process {}` block. Looking at how it's written, it looks a bit like `$Input` is defined as `$PipelineEnumerator.MoveNext()`, which would offer some explanation as to why it can only be accessed once.\r\n\r\nI've never really seen `$Input` used outside the `end {}` block of a function, so I'm not sure how its behaviour is meant to be defined in `process {}` itself. Good catch, this is a very odd one indeed.\r\n\r\nEDIT: The folks in the PowerShell Slack & Discord point out that this is probably by design (and thus _really_ needs to be better documented) as mentioned here: https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/dotnet/.net-tools/down-the-rabbit-hole--a-study-in-powershell-pipelines,-functions,-and-parameters/#tenth\r\n\r\nIn other words, it's designed to be _consumed_, such that when you reach the `end {}` block you can either consume the leftovers if you skipped any for whatever reason, or just process everything in the end block instead. Accessing it in `process {}` effectively consumes that item so that there isn't any duplication.",
