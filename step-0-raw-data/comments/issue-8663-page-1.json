    "body": "Thank you for the comment @kilasuit.\r\n\r\nYes, I know that you can do just about anything in PowerShell. I could certainly write a function or download the Chocolately package.  My point is that it could be an easy fix for the PowerShell team and a reflection that the release cadence of PowerShell is now very different from Windows PowerShell (which is, of course, a good thing in and of it self). \r\n\r\nThe IT Pro, for whom PowerShell is just a tool, needs a very simple way to keep up to date. This could include:\r\n1. Automatically ship the updated versions of PWSH to the relevant repos (Linux/Mac/Windows). And convincing the in-box update mechanisms to download updates as a package in the 'normal' way (i.e. on Windows, ship optionally by Windows Update, on Ubuntu enable apt-get) so that IT pros get updates just like other updates. And if you can't enable Windows Update to take the updates, at least put it out onto the PS Gallery\r\n2. Ship an in-box **Update-PowerShell** cmdlet that updates 'this' version of Pwsh with the latest version if one exists. Of course, for completness, let it have a **-Version** parameter to allow me to choose if I need to, and PLEASE: a **-NoSideBySide** switch which would allow the installer to install into the existing folder so as to not invalidate pinned taskbar shortcuts (I, and I am sure others find having to have to re-create shortcuts after each update a sub-optimal experience). And maybe making side x side vs overwrite an installation option in the Installation GUI?\r\n3. Finally, during the initial PWSH installation, offer to create a scheduled task or cron job that checked for and updated that version of PWSH. \r\n\r\nAs I have said, we have **Update-Help** which is a nice way to get updates - if they exist.  I'd like to make updating PowerShell as easy. When I set up a new box, or sit down to do some work on my main workstation, I just run Update-Help to update the version of Pwsh should I there be one. I just want to simplify the tasks involved with taking more regular updates to Pwsh.",

That being said other Microsoft products have for a long time been able to tie into the Windows Update system, but IIRC other Products like Visual Studio and VS Code do not get updates this way, so there's not a unified way\r\n\r\n> It the Linux side, all updates are working Great!!\r\nWell that's because Linux have had package management sorted for years. Windows has had SCCM for packages in enterprises but this doesn't help organisations that have not implemented SCCM or may never intend to.\r\n\r\nAll in all this issue really boils down to what Microsoft are doing about Package Management in Windows, just as much as it does about updating PowerShell going forward and I am 100% that this is not something that @joeyaiello & @SteveL-MSFT and the team want to invest effort into this if there are possibly bigger changes coming around the corner, which would be the right decision even if it does mean that there is not a simple solution in the mean time.\r\n\r\nI mean they already have the basics for Package Management in the OneGet Repository https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/ (a semi related team to the PowerShell team) as this is the is the underlying tech for PowerShellGet and already has some Package Management Support built in via Nuget Feeds anyway as well as MSI, MSU, Programs and experimental Chocolatey support.\r\n\r\nI have searched all issues for any other similar issues to those already mentioned in this issue and also found the following #7864 #5477 that are also linked to the updating of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n",

All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nhttps://aka.ms/powershell\r\nType 'help' to get help.\r\n\r\n   A new PowerShell stable release is available: v7.0.2\r\n   Upgrade now, or check out the release page at:\r\n     https://aka.ms/PowerShell-Release?tag=v7.0.2\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\System32>\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou really need an Upgrade command. It is ridiculous to have to download the update from Github and have scroll through a giant list of different releases from different platforms. One shouldn't have to rely on third-party scripts either. It should be built-in functionality.\r\n\r\nThis is kind of like .NET Core, where every time you install a new version, you get another copy. Then, Microsoft figured out it wasn't good for users that have 9 million different copies of .NET Core on there system and they changed it where it now removes minor versions.\r\n\r\nIs PowerShell Core going to replace Windows PowerShell at some point? Microsoft is doing the same confusing business with this that they did with .NET Framework/.NET Core. In other words, a total disaster.\r\n\r\nAlso, speaking of Update-Help could someone at Microsoft fix that so it actually works. For years, on multiple different computers I have always had the problem where that command fails. I don't understand what is so difficult about this. It should just be a matter of downloading some files. If after years and years you can't get something basic like that working, something is wrong.\r\n\r\nI would just assume Microsoft eliminate Windows Update in general and just switch to apt. Again, not sure why this stuff works so much better in the Linux world.",

A good reason to have it updated by Windows Update automatically. Of course .NET Core isn't handled either, which also had a vulnerability. That is kind of the whole reason there was a system-wide install of .NET Framework. So, you only had to patch one install (or a few of different versions). .NET Core does away with that. As a developer, if you aren't careful, you end up with tens of versions of .NET Core on your system (though I think Microsoft tries to uninstall old minor versions now by default).",

    "body": "@jemiller0 I totally get where you're coming from, but you have to understand that there are significant IT workflows already in place for Windows admins to keep software updated and their environments compliant. To that end, we're still working very hard in the 7.1 timeframe to integrate with the Microsoft Download Catalog so that we're integrated with SCCM, WSUS, and Microsoft Update workflows. \r\n\r\nThat being said, you should also check out [winget](https://github.com/Microsoft/winget-cli). We already have a package there, and it works very much like `apt`. Eventually, we expect for `winget` to be more tightly integrated with the aforementioned IT workflows, but today it already works great as an interactive package install/update tool. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, you can use [.NET Global Tools](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/introducing-powershell-as-net-global-tool/) to keep PowerShell up-to-date if you're already keeping a .NET Core SDK up-to-date on your box. \r\n\r\n@MaximoTrinidad I'm still not totally understanding that issue, as 3.1.3 and 3.1.5 should be backwards/forwards compatible....would you mind filing another issue?

But the legal issues over minor things like support are likely to be major barriers in the short term. I am certain Microsoft's legal team can find a long term resolution that would allow Windows Update to be used. But Max, you and I have been around long enough to know the challenge here. :-)  If there is any way we can do to support @joeyaiello over this??\r\n\r\nAs I said earlier, I'd like an Update-PowerShell command built into PowerShell 7. If that command can be made more cross-platform so much the better (but given the nature of Linux that is probably harder than it would be for Windows). We have Update-Help. Yes I agree there are, as is so typical in the PowerShell world, many ways to do this and I have my own hand crafted solutions. \r\n\r\nI come back to the point that warnings should be easily actionable - just telling me I should update is less useful than giving me a simple solution (ie run UPdate-PowerShell).\r\n\r\nAnd as for WInget - I am loath to use any tool that does not honour the sacred vow. Winget is just a powertoy for developers - call me when it's a serious IT Pro and Enterprise Management tool. ",

What I would _expect_, and what I believe is already happening, is that updates be available through update services, SCCM, the Microsoft Store, and third-party repositories. There are locations where I am expecting enterprise-level admins are already managing software deployments. For all other use cases, I don't see a problem with existing community modules like PSReleaseTools or even tools like winget. We never had an update command in Windows PowerShell. We got new versions with new operating system releases, **and** they were available as downloads. I don't see why PowerShell 7.x needs to be any different.\r\n\r\nBut...all of these backend pieces need to be in place before the nag prompt appears. In fact, I'd like the nag prompt to be delayed for at least a week after the backend pieces have been deployed.",

If we want faster times, we need to work with Windows to get the store version of PowerShell in parity with a traditionally installed PowerShell.  Those conversations are happening.\r\n\r\n@BrandonBoone  Please open another issue about the language/function of the update prompt.\r\n\r\n",
