    "body": "> Can you explain in more detail why this is significantly different from the stdout case?\r\n\r\nThe biggest technical issue is around merging stderr into stdout. So the ideal way this would work (using Windows APIs as an example) is I would create a single pipe (or file for redirection) with `kernel32!CreatePipe` (or `kernel32!CreateFile`) that I could pass to `kernel32!CreateProcess` for both stdout and stderr. I don't have a generic way to do this without writing a lot of platform specific code so instead I'm reading from the `Stream` created by `System.Diagnostics.Process` for `stdout`.\r\n\r\nDoing the same for `stderr` and trying to flush them both into the downstream's stdin `Stream` leads to a significant amount of inconsistency in order. That inconsistency already exists in the current string reading behavior but it's made worse when dealing with bytes directly as you can end up writing half of a line (or even half of a unicode glyph) from stdout and then another half from stderr.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't directly exclude lighting up the `native 2> log.txt` scenario and reverting only for `native 2>&1`, but it does make it less clear cut. It's easy to understand that \"error is text, so it's treated like strings, and when you merge it makes stdout also like strings\". It's harder to understand \"neither are treated like strings unless you merge them together\" if that makes sense.\r\n\r\nIt's also not necessarily a simple switch I'd be flipping to enable it for stderr as well. There are a lot of places it needs to be special cased in pipeline creation similarly to how I'm doing it for stdout but subtly different. If/when this PR is merged I'll create a separate issue that is specifically for preserving bytes when redirecting stderr so the engine WG can discuss it. This PR will be for stdout specifically, but that doesn't necessarily mean another PR can't address it.",

PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detected.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiU2VlbWluZ2x5U2NpZW5jZSIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNzg1NyIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic1VwIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiU2VlbWluZ2x5U2NpZW5jZSIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNzg1NyIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6Ik5ldXRyYWwifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiU2VlbWluZ2x5U2NpZW5jZSIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNzg1NyIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic0Rvd24ifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "> This was in [#559 (comment)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/559#issuecomment-240957563) If I understand write it is that we want, but can not implement due to Process class limitations, so we would have to fall in low APIs?\r\n\r\nSo it kind of depends how you interpret what @vors was saying there. In a sense, that's what I'm doing in this PR.\r\n\r\nIn another sense (which is what you're getting at) there is another route that would be a much bigger lift but would be closer to how other shells implement it.\r\n\r\nOn Windows that would be using `CreatePipe` to create a single pipe that we pass to `CreateProcess` for both the upstream's stdout and the downstream's stdin. And something somewhat similar on *nix with `pipe`.\r\n\r\nThat would require rewriting a significant chunk of the code as we wouldn't be able to use `System.Diagnostics.Process` at all really. I'm definitely interested to see if I can make that work, but not in this PR. Probably something I need to pursue on my own time, and tbh highly likely to be too great of an additional maintenance burden for the value add anyway.",
