But if I'm not mistaken that can easily be made to work with a `ScriptBlock`. \r\n\r\nI guess the question is how to set it. It could be supplied as a parameter or perhaps exposed as a public static property on `WebRequestPSCmdlet` or somewhere else (maybe its own singleton?). I imagine that most users would want this as a sort of `set and forget` for the duration of the thread as the callback could contain the logic for all their calls to the Web Cmdlets. \r\n\r\nMaking it a parameter is the easy route, but then user would have to supply it every call or set it as a `$PSDefaultParameterValues` entry. That might be a bit inconvenient, but it is definitely a pattern most PowerShell users are familiar with. If the Parameter is acceptable, this could be implemented fairly quick.",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT Thanks for clarifying, Unfortunately, it looks like we missed the mark on what @xuesongyuan was requesting. It looks like they are referring to remoting. I believe the web cmdlets are completely decoupled from that in Core. `HttpClient` _only_ uses per-connection validation callbacks, but I'm not familiar with anything in the remoting code to be of use there and at glance it is not using `HttpClient`.\r\n\r\nI can see value in supplying a callback for the web cmdlets, so I will create a new issue to track that. \r\n\r\nAs for assigning issues to contributors, @iSazonov has been able to [assign to me](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues?q=is%3Aissue+assignee%3Amarkekraus+is%3Aclosed) in the past.\r\n\r\n@xuesongyuan It would be possible in 5.1 to create validation logic that would accommodate both remoting and web requests by including checks on the `sender` object. I don't think `ServicePointManager.RemoteCertificateValidationCallback` works at all in Core.",

I do not know how or if this impacts remoting. But if it does impact both web requests and remoting in 5.1, the logic in the callback can handle both but you would need to do checks on the `sender` object to determine what is calling it. I'm not meaning to suggest this is possible, but that it is something you could test now in Windows PowerShell 5.1.\r\n\r\nI apologize for the confusion.
