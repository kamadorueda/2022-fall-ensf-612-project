    "body": "Question - is there a way to verify that assertion in a way that can be tested in CI? Debug asserts are great but can cause annoying crashes which seems to be more likely to be a nuisance in a case like this.\r\n\r\nCan we add a unit test in C# to verify this instead, so we get a clear test failure without generating broken build artifacts? Doubly so if we're expecting this number to change in future, we should be very careful about using a debug assert here, which will render this functionality entirely unusable in debug builds and I'm not sure will even show up in CI at all.
