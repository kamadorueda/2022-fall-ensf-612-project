    "body": "I believe @jpsnover opened a related issue quite a while back along the lines of allowing the `-*action` parameter to take scriptblocks handlers instead of just enum values.  WRT this proposal, I'm not completely sure of the utility of what's being proposed. In most cases, `try/catch` or `trap` already address the majority of the scenarios. The one that isn't covered is creating a durable handler that survives for the whole session.  This might be interesting in an interactive session but as a global shared binding, it couldn't  be used in a reusable script safely (since more than one script might set it). Also, depending on what you're trying to do, there might be better ways to achieve it. @p0W3RH311  can you provide a practical (useful) example of how you see this being used and what problems it might solve? Thanks.  Oh - and one more clarification - would it work for non-terminating errors, terminating errors or both? Ok two clarifications - what happens after the handler runs - does the script resume, terminate or skip the remaining statements?",
