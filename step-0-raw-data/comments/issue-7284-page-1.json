    "body": "@iSazonov The CodeFactor reports `String` was used instead of `string`. There are 33 instances of `String` in this file. Changing them all will make it harder to review. I think the style changes can go to a separate issue. Actually, `String` is used heavily in our code base, especially when calling static methods/properties on `string`. It's probably better off to disable this rule.",
