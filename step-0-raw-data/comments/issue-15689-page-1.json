An example is `JProperty` from Newtonsoft.Json:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nclass JProperty\r\n{\r\n    // inherited\r\n    T Value<T>(object key);\r\n\r\n    JToken Value { get; set; }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nMaybe the binder should prioritize methods over explicitly implemented interface properties rather than *any* property.  Though that would still be breaking change, I can't quickly find an example of an existing API with a realistic use case that would be broken.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think this comes up infrequently enough that a workaround of `$obj.psobject.Methods['MethodName'].Invoke($args)` is probably good enough.",
