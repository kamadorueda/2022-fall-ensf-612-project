However, this created a problem once we made PowerShell Core cross platform.  The common alias to use on Windows and non-Windows is `gcm` which is the alias for `Get-Command`.  With this, you don't need to use `which` or `where` (depending on what OS you are on).  As noted by @vexx32 you can always add your favorite aliases to your `$profile`.",
