As I read through all the release notes and the marketing hype, I can't find an answer to a pretty basic question. Hopefully, someone can enlighten me here. Is version 7 of PowerShell going to be a 'full' product (with IDE and all the GUI bells and whistles) or is this just going to be another 'core only' version. We've not had a new GUI since version 5. With all the announcements and talk about how great it's going to be, I thought that this upgrade would really be 'big'. I'd appreciate it immensely if someone could give me a final word on this. I feel like a complete and utter 'noob', but I really wanted to know. TIA and LLAP",

    "body": "> 1. Windows PowerShell 5.1 and associated ISE are at end of life. They are feature complete and are only ever likely to be updated to fix bugs.\r\n\r\nUp to a point. Windows PowerShell 5 is not being enhanced any further, much like CMD or VBScript. However the plan of record is that they will continue to ship in the box with windows and be supported (meaning bug fixes). Some clients will continue to use the version which comes in the box, rather than the version which needs to be downloaded.  \r\n\r\n> 2. Going forward, PowerShell is PowerShell Core or in due course PowerShell 7. That code, as such, as no GUI - the GUI is VS Code.\r\n\r\nThe GUI editor / IDE of choice is indeed VS code. However the dropping of the word \"core\" is primarily because 7 is not the bare-bones thing which PowerShell Core 6 was. It can print. It can display windows forms, it has Out-Gridview and get-help -show Window. It's better at using 5 under the covers to provide functionality. So I think it sells 7 short to say it has no GUI - it might be a bit to marketing to call it \"best of both\" because it isn't 100%  It feels to me that 6 was only 80% and 7 is 99% but those numbers are feel, and totally unscientific. \r\n \r\n",

However with my ex-Microsoftie hat on I think the definition of \"supported\" hasn't changed, and means ultimately PSS can get a hotfix for a bug if it is needed. There are all sorts of dances done to say it can be worked around or isn't really a bug so a hotfix isn't needed.  And at this stage no-one should expect long standing bugs to be fixed. Windows PowerShell 5 is in the same place as CMD or VB script ... except of course CMD has had ansi support added, notepad has been updated for the first time since Windows 2000, and flight-sim is back from the dead.  But it would be a departure from the plan of record to do a Windows PowerShell 5.2\r\n\r\nThe newer .net core and the ability to support the same GUI things on windows which 5 supported means everything I care about works again. 6 was a necessary stepping stone, 7 is (I think) what people want and (I think) it will strengthen old friendships and make a whole pile of new ones. The ISE is still there when it is appropriate, but that's less and less often.\r\n",

As I read through all the release notes and the marketing hype, I can't find an answer to a pretty basic question. Hopefully, someone can enlighten me here. Is version 7 of PowerShell going to be a 'full' product (with IDE and all the GUI bells and whistles) or is this just going to be another 'core only' version. We've not had a new GUI since version 5. With all the announcements and talk about how great it's going to be, I thought that this upgrade would really be 'big'. I'd appreciate it immensely if someone could give me a final word on this. I feel like a complete and utter 'noob', but I really wanted to know. TIA and LLAP\r\n\r\nyes,It should be called powershell core 1.1. ;)",
