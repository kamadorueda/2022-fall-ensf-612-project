In your script, add `-AsHashTable` to get an object that supports this.\r\n\r\nHowever, I think that a warning instead of an error may be better here and have the resulting object not contain that property by default.",

    "body": "Thanks @SteveL-MSFT for the suggestion. Maybe an additional switch parameter for Invoke-RestMethod would make sense then? If Invoke-RestMethod automatically converts the response, it should offer a way to do exactly what you suggested I do with ConvertFrom-Json. That way, there would be no need to test the result for a (probably yet unknown) JSON property to determine if the conversion silently failed or not.\r\nFor the time being, the workaround sure works for me.",

    "body": "@nyanhp I have considered exposing the same option to `Invoke-RestMethod`. I'm torn because it violates single responsibility principle. The `Invoke-RestMethod` auto-conversion covers a very large number of use cases, but not all of them (including the one you outline here). `ConvertFrom-Json` is the right tool for more complex JSON conversion. I would like to limit coupling changes in `ConvertFrom-Json` to changes in `Invoke-RestMethod` as much as possible.\r\n\r\nAssuming we did add `-AsHashTable`  to `Invoke-RestMethod`, in instances where the remote endpoint returns a blank/empty key name, you would still run into the surprise of having to add `-AsHashTable`.  the effort to change the code to include `-AsHashTable` or pipe the result to `ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashTable` is effectively the same.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the convenience of adding `-AsHashTable`  to `Invoke-RestMethod` outweighs the cost of coupling those cmdlets further.",
