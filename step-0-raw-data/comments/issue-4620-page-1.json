    "body": "@iSazonov I'm considering using the aspnetcore project without docker as the baked in Kestrel server is available cross-platform. Making the tests CI specific couples them with the CI and then breaks when the CI environment changes. The only problem with the aspnetcore approach is that the test will now be coupled with the dotnet SDK, probably not a huge deal as moving to the next major version would entail other code and testing reworks. I welcome your input on it in #4609.",
