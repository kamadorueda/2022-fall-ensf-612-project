    "body": "This is due to an additional overload in `String.Split`. In 7.3 it selects the new `String.Split(string)` overload where previously it converted to `char[]` and selected `String.Split(char[])`.\r\n\r\nNote that in neither version is it considered an escape character, it was just previously splitting on  any of the characters in the string rather than the exact string. You may be looking for a split that uses regex (`String.Split` does not), that would be either the split operator (`-split`) or the `[regex]::Split` method.",
