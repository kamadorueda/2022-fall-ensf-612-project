    "body": "I can replicate the problem but there's a few things that need to be cleared up. There are 3 main types of SSH methods when it comes to SSH on Windows:\r\n\r\n* When you call `ssh user@host` you are creating an interactive logon\r\n* When you call `ssh user@host 'command to run'` you are creating a non-interactive logon to run an individual command\r\n* When you call `Enter-PSSession` or `Invoke-Command` with the `-HostName` in PowerShell you are creating a PSRemoting session through the PowerShell subsystem\r\n\r\nFor my testing I've set the following reg keys\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\OpenSSH\" -Name DefaultShell -Value \"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe\"\r\nSet-ItemProperty -Path \"HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\OpenSSH\" -Name DefaultShellCommandOption -Value \"-NoLogo -Command\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first is simple, the `sshd` service will start a new process that is set to call `C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe` by default or whatever `DefaultShell` is set at. In this example I simply called `ssh username@hostname` and I can see that `sshd.exe` will spawn the pwsh process based on what I have set in `DefaultShell`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1090\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/95304937-acc4eb80-08c8-11eb-84fc-5139819e3a3f.png\">\r\n\r\nI did find that the value of `DefaultShellCommandOption` is ignored here, it seems like only `DefaultShell` is used for this type of logon.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `ssh username@hostname Start-Sleep -Seconds 60` this is the process tree\r\n\r\n<img width=\"765\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/95305393-3ffe2100-08c9-11eb-979d-41c5adfdf168.png\">\r\n\r\nThe command line here is `\"C:\\program files\\powershell\\7\\pwsh.exe\" -c \"Start-Sleep -Seconds 60\"` which is not what I have specified in `DefaultShellCommandOption`. This is entirely outside of PowerShell's realm, the `sshd.exe` service is ignoring the value here\r\n\r\nFinally when I run `Enter-PSSession -HostName hostname` this is the process tree\r\n\r\n<img width=\"964\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/95305869-ecd89e00-08c9-11eb-9876-8526c6f5a4a1.png\">\r\n\r\nWe can see that our `Subsystem` entry was used and started the value that was in your `sshd_config`. This is because PowerShell does not use a naked SSH session but rather an SSH subsystem to read and write bytes directly to that `pwsh -sshs` process. This is done specifically for PSRemoting which doesn't operate like a normal process but rather with an exchange of PowerShell specific packets.\r\n\r\nPutting it all together PowerShell is doing nothing here that isn't expected. It's been told to start normally which it does so. The issue lies in the Win32-OpenSSH software as that isn't using the `DefaultShellCommandOption` option that is configured. This must be fixed there as there is nothing the PowerShell team can do. ~~It may even already be fixed in a newer release of Win32-OpenSSH, I know the one that is included in Windows is quite old~~ (scratch that, I just tested the latest GitHub release and it's still an issue).",

(I can only login from local host, but remote host just keep timing out and DEBUG3 doesn't show anything at all.  :-1: \r\n\r\n```diff\r\n- UPDATE\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlthough it should have been obvious, I did not \"uninstall\" the old out-of-the-box OpenSSH before trying the new one. Apparently it took over some ports or services and messed with the new one. As soon as I removed those client/server packages it worked again as before.  I wish there were some better log messages about this. (There were none.)",
