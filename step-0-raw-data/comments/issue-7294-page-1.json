I would expect class members to have default values as they do in other .NET languages.  Coercing null to empty string is already a confusing foot gun in other contexts, I wouldn’t want to see it extended to classes. ",

    "body": "@mattpwhite: \r\n\r\nThe primary purpose of this issue is to show the _lack of consistency_.\r\n\r\nI suggested resolving the inconsistency toward PowerShell-like behavior, because, as demonstrated, in the majority of cases you already _do_ get the surprising behavior in the context of custom classes - in line with non-class PowerShell behavior: \r\n\r\n  * assigning `$null` to a `[string]`-typed property or variable\r\n  * returning `$null` from a `[string]`-typed method.\r\n\r\n(Ideally, PowerShell itself should also default `[string]` instances to `$null`, but [that ship has sailed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4616#issuecomment-323530442))\r\n\r\nThat said, in other respects classes are closer to C# behavior, not least syntactically.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose resolving the inconsistency toward C#-like behavior (allowing assigning `$null` to `[string]` variables/properties / allowing returning `$null` from `[string]`-typed methods) is another option.\r\n\r\nBoth resolutions are technically breaking changes, so a third option is to simply live with the inconsistency and merely document it.\r\n\r\nI can't really speak to the guiding principles behind the behavior of PowerShell classes.\r\nPerhaps @lzybkr  can help out.\r\n",
