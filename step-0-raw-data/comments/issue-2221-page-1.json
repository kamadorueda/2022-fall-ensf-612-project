In case I need to debug a situation where too much memory is used for/by something.  But even without that, yeah I'd be fine with removing these.\n",

There may be a lot of errors in\nsome cases. This is bad for long running processes. Developers must keep\nin mind that memory may leak via errors and care of this. Why?\n\nBesides, when errors really have to be collected and analysed then use of\n`-ErrorVariable` parameter for a particular command is better than use of\n`$Error` which also may contain noise errors. `-ErrorVariable` is unlimited.\n",
