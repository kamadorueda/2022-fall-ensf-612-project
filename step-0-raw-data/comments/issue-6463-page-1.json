In addition to NuGet packages, currently there are modules and assemblies I have to outright _copy from PowerShell's deployment package_ (i.e. not just the SDK from NuGet).\r\n\r\nThis whole thing (plus the monthly bugfix release) has made me a bit nervous about the maintenance. I don't suppose you guys want a PR to just add the jupyter kernel to the core? ;-)",
