I am referencing the ternary operator parsing tests that @daxian-dbw added.  In some ways this is similar to how PSReadLine performs tests of its highlighting, but without simulating the input and output steps.\r\n\r\n- `ParseInput` a sample command,\r\n- verify select tokens are as expected (either by `TokenKind` or `TokenFlag`).\r\n\r\nI'll work on getting this done.",
