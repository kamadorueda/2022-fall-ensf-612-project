    "body": "@237dmitry, if you run the code in the initial post, you'll see the problem.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't _always_ happen, but I've just realized that this issue will go away if what @MatejKafka reported in #15235 gets fixed (which is the right thing to do), so I'm closing this.\r\n\r\nIn short: if there's a mismatch between the _process_' current directory (as reported by `[Environment]::CurrentDir`) and _PowerShell's_ (which is typically the case), the symlink target's _type_ (file vs. directory) may be mis-identified.\r\n\r\nIn the case at hand, `target` - but not `.\\target` - is mistakenly looked for in `[Environment]::CurrentDir` and, if there's no such item there, it is assumed to be a _file_, so that the `link1` symlink is created _with the wrong type_ (it behaves like a _file_, even though its true target is a _directory_).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
