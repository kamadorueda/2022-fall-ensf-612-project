I'm a little nervous about that.\r\n\r\nErrors in `Clean` block will be captured in `-ErrorVariable`, and also will be emitted to user as visible errors. All errors happen in `Clean` should (and can) be found in `$Error`.\r\n\r\n> I should think the clean up block runs in with implicit `SilentlyContinue` so errors are captured, but not displayed. What if the user explicitly sets `$ErrorActionPreference = \"Inquire\" (or confirm)`, will we then prompt?\r\n\r\nI personally prefer to not make the `Clean` block have a different default `ActionPreference` for error. I think it should just behave the same as other named blocks. That would also make it easier for the user to quickly know if there are any error in their `Clean` block.\r\n\r\n@JamesWTruher The proposed error handling behavior already works with the changes in this PR, so I think it will be helpful if you can build this PR and play with it. You can also download the build artifacts from CIs, for example, the windows build can be downloaded [here](https://dev.azure.com/powershell/_apis/resources/Containers/4302657/build?itemPath=build%2Fbuild.zip).

The PR description has been updated, which may be helpful to the review\r\n2. Extensive tests were added, especially around the error handling behavior. The `PipelineBehaviour.Tests.ps1` contains tests for the functional behaviors other than error handling, which may be helpful to the review.\r\n3. `InvokeWithPipeImpl` is made not support directly invoking the `clean` block of a script block because of the difference in semantics between `clean` and the other named blocks. The `.ForEach` magic method is also made not support a script block with the `clean` block, to keep parity with `ForEach-Object`.",

I have responded and addressed all your comments.\r\n\r\n> I'm mostly just curious what folks think the desired behaviour for having the clean block be interruptible should be. Has the committee weighed in on that as yet?\r\n\r\n@vexx32 The committee had a brief discussion before but didn't take a deep dive. As I have captured in the RFC, the `finally` block's current behavior is unexpected and inconsistent to some extent. At the meantime, we want `clean` and `finally` to have consistent behaviors in the event of pipeline stopping. So, if we decide to have non-cancellable `clean` block, the `finally` behavior needs to be fixed too. There were concerns about the non-cancellable behavior too. In a nutshell, there was no conclusion in the previous committee discussion.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, I follows the current `finally` behavior, and we can leave the change of that behavior to a separate PR once there is a conclusion.",
