    "body": "@asrosent The console host was never intended to be part of the API. It was expected that host implementers would implement _all_ of the host classes. That said, there are two aspects to the console host - the host itself and the set of services provided to the running script through `$PSHost`. The latter is definitely useful/reuseable by _other_ console hosts even if the former is not. (We never really expected anyone would write another console host. Clearly we were wrong :-)  Interestingly, there are Win32 things that work in the console host that do not work in the PowerShell API:\r\n```powershell\r\n [powershell]::create().AddCommand(\"notepad\").Invoke()\r\n```\r\nhangs where\r\n```powershell\r\nnotepad\r\n```\r\ndoes not. In practice there is a complex bit of logic (I know it's complex because i wrote it.) that the console host uses on Windows to detect when a GUI process should automatically go into the background. It would be nice if that logic was projected into the API.",

In fact `StartTranscriptCommand` and `StopTranscriptCommand` are officially not APIs as they derive from `PSCmdlet` not `Cmdlet`.  But things evolve. For myself, I would love to see more of the console functionality exposed through the APIs. Now wrt the Std API. I believe it only contains things that are universal. But i don't really remember all that clearly. @JamesWTruher should be able to answer more authoritatively. ",
