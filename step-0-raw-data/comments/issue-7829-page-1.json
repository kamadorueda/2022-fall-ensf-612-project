    "body": "@mkanet I think you miss the point.  \r\n\r\nIn the code above you simply type \"unMapDrives\" and all of them are now removed.  I don't see how typing two commands (i.e. Remove-PSDrive and then net use /del \\$Device 2>null) is any easier.\r\n\r\nThe above code is written you so can load it into your powershell profile.   Once that is set you can use it as much as you want.  From then on out you just type the one command.  It is also nice because it gives you feedback and makes checks to ensure it all worked properly.  Your script outputs any errors to null so you have to check manually if it was successful or not.  Of course that may be what you want so... ymmv. \r\n\r\nThe nice thing about scripting is there are many ways to accomplish the same thing!  Thanks for commenting and showing what works for you.",

The drive is a _persistent_ mapped drive, meaning it will continue well after a session has gone, through log outs and reboots. Conversely a session is exactly that - something temporary. The drive should be un-mappable from any session you chose with the right command, but, as shown in the original post, it is not. Also I should have mentioned in the original post, but -force, -scope etc have no affect on this bug. It... persists.\r\n\r\n\r\n> I have just reproduced this issue with PowerShell 7.0.0.\r\n\r\nThis is really disappointing!",

I issue the same command-let again, but replacing X with Y (just to be sure to have a 'clean' situation) but using a non-existent scope option (\"dummyscope\"). \r\nIt obviously gives an error (sorry it's in italian, but it's just the classic invalid-argument error). \r\nThen something strange happens. The drive gets mapped the same (at system level too) but goes into the very state of non-removable drives that's the issue studied here.\r\nTo get this behavior I imagine that the -Scope parameter is not validated at the beginning of the function, but after something (the actual mapping) has already been done but the error sort of prevents the registration of the unit where it should be to get correctly removed after. \r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Agostino> New-PSDrive -Name Y -PSProvider FileSystem \\\\localhost\\share -Persist -Scope dummyscope\r\nNew-PSDrive : Non è possibile elaborare l'argomento perché il valore dell'argomento \"scopeID\" non è valido.
