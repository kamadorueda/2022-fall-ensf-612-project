The biggest use case I have for this is with `diff`. For example: `PS> diff -u <(Get-Content -Raw one.json | jp *) <(Get-Content -Raw two.json | jp *)`\r\n\r\nI work with a lot of JSON, and sometimes I need a textual diff. Doing so requires that the data be normalized first and I'd like to avoid creating temporary files to do this, especially in cases where the JSON data may contain sensitive information.\r\n\r\nAlso, this isn't just a Linux/Mac issue; its usefulness is just as significant on Windows.",
