You have to use the release candidate or checkout straight from devel as the `psrp` connection plugin was only recently added.\r\n\r\nFrom there create a file called `inventory.ini` with the following contents;\r\n\r\n```\r\n[windows]\r\nwindows-server\r\n\r\n[windows:vars]\r\nansible_user=username\r\nansible_password=password\r\nansible_connection=psrp\r\nansible_port=5986\r\n# only needed if using https (port 5986) and self signed certs\r\nansible_psrp_cert_validation=ignore\r\n\r\n# if you want to use basic auth for a more stable timing test add the following\r\nansible_psrp_auth=basic\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom there you can test out the timings with the following commands\r\n\r\n```\r\n# test out against the Microsoft.PowerShell (PSDesktop) endpoint\r\ntime ansible -i inventory.ini windows -m win_ping\r\n\r\n# out out against the PowerShell.6 (PSCore) endpoint\r\ntime ansible -i inventory.ini windows -m win_ping -e ansible_psrp_configuration_name=PowerShell.6\r\n```\r\n\r\nI found that there was roughly a .5 second slowdown when working against the PSCore configuration. I was also able to replicate this when using the basic winrm connection plugin and changing the PS executable called to the PSCore one and it was also slower than PSDesktop.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure what the cause is and this was very preliminary tests that I ran but it was consistent.",

I was asked to provide some reproducers and that's all I have right now.\r\n\r\nWhile I agree reproducing this using the native cmdlets is the next step, so far I've merely observed running an Ansible command over the `PowerShell.6` endpoint compared to the `Microsoft.PowerShell` is slower. This is also true of running a native command through `pwsh.exe` vs `powershell.exe`.\r\n\r\nA really simple example is to look at the startup time of pwsh vs powershell;\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\vagrant-domain>C:\\temp\\ptime.exe powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command Write-Output abc\r\n\r\nptime 1.0 for Win32, Freeware - http://www.pc-tools.net/\r\nCopyright(C) 2002, Jem Berkes <jberkes@pc-tools.net>\r\n\r\n===  powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command Write-Output abc ===\r\nabc\r\n\r\nExecution time: 0.401 s\r\n\r\nC:\\Users\\vagrant-domain>C:\\temp\\ptime.exe pwsh.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command Write-Output abc\r\n\r\nptime 1.0 for Win32, Freeware - http://www.pc-tools.net/\r\nCopyright(C) 2002, Jem Berkes <jberkes@pc-tools.net>\r\n\r\n===  pwsh.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command Write-Output abc ===\r\nabc\r\n\r\nExecution time: 0.811 s\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can see that pwsh is ~.4 seconds slower to startup compared to PowerShell.

    "body": "That's correct we use both methods. Traditionally, the `winrm` connection plugin uses WinRS to create a shell and execute modules with `PowerShell -NoProfile -NonInteractive -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command -` and we send the module through the stdin pipe of this process. More recently we've added in the `psrp` connection plugin which uses PSRP (over WinRM) to start a Runspace Pool and execute the module over a PowerShell pipeline. Between the 2, `winrm` is what 99% of Windows users use right now as `psrp` is more experimental and quite new. I found that both `winrm` and `psrp` took longer to execute when using the PSCore equivalents, pwsh.exe for winrm and PowerShell.6 for psrp.\r\n\r\nWe created the `psrp` connection plugin as we found that creating a new pool and pipeline was slightly faster than the overhead that WinRS has. There are also other issues in the Python WinRM library that `winrm` uses which `psrp` is designed to overcome but that's unrelated to this conversation. We are also looking into persisted connections so we can share the pool between Ansible tasks to speed up execution even more but have hit some roadblocks in Ansible itself that has stopped us so far.",

It is unfortunate that psrp is also used for the OMI implementation, which causes confusion.\r\n\r\nAnyway, OMI/WinRM is not supported on Windows PowerShell, only on PSCore6.  If you are seeing a performance difference using WinRM (Windows platform only) based PowerShell remoting between Windows PowerShell and PSCore6, then that certainly needs investigating.  But I expect OMI/WinRM to be noticeably slower than WinRM since it includes another translation layer.",
