    "body": "@iSazonov \r\n\r\nThanks for getting back to me, I know that was a lot to digest.\r\nI have heard of Pester but I am not familiar with it and therefore have not used it before.\r\n\r\nI understand the importance of preparing a good bug report which is why I spent so much time (way more than I expected) detailing and comparing everything in my original report and why I detailed the expected and actual outcomes in each case.\r\n\r\nI also agree that you are correct that my bug report is only dealing with FileSystem provider and I have wondered if the \"other\" providers might be part of the reason that this problem exists in the first place.   If that turns out to be the case then maybe that means we need Copy-File and/or Copy-Directory cmdlets to provide the basic functionality that exists in cmd.exe / xcopy / robocopy.\r\n\r\nWhile there may be additional items, I think my 3 summary points at the end summarize the key areas that contribute to the problems.\r\n\r\nWhen you consider the following use cases:\r\n\r\nCopy-Item dir1 dir2\r\nCopy-Item dir1 dir2 -Recurse\r\n\r\nPretty much every command line environment I have ever worked with (over the last 30+ years) or any of the external tools like xcopy, robocopy, or the many others that have existed over the years all understand and produce the correct results for those command regardless of whether the target directory exists or not and regardless of what layout of files and folders exists under dir1 and dir2 and regardless of whether you want to recurse or not.\r\n\r\nThe only exception is Copy-Item.  Although I provided 12 different examples, the additional examples that added '*' and '*.*' to the commands were attempts by me to try to find a syntax for Copy-Item that would produce the results for the above 2 use cases which was the real goal.  I included them so that you could see all the different examples that I tried to accomplish the goal and that would produce results that were repeatable.\r\n\r\nIn the PowerShell environment, I expect to have to use -Force for a repeat run, but I also expect to get the same results when I rerun, however, Copy-Item pretty much fails in all cases which is why I said that it is unusable in all but the most simple cases.   \r\n\r\nBecause of these issues I have replaced Copy-Item and cp with pointers to cmd.exe copy in my profile because I needed something that worked but I incorrect expected that they would have been addressed long before we reached PS 7 since copy is considered core/basic functionality.\r\n\r\nWhen you also consider that Copy-Item will overwrite files with no warning, I consider it a pretty serious issue and would have expected the cmlet to be using ShouldProcess (which it may be) and have a confirmation level such that destructive actions could not occur without confirmation.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, those destructive issues should raise the priority level on these bugs.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can get the peopled that wrote xcopy or robocopy involved as they have a handle on exactly what the use cases are and the expected results?\r\n\r\nI hope you can move forward with what I provided as my plate is pretty full right now and I'm not sure I have time install, setup, and learn pester and then recreate everything that I already provided.\r\n\r\nIs it possible for you to move forward with the details I have provided as I have already documented the use cases, expected results, and also provided a script and the commands that you can use to recreate each of the examples demonstrated?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n",

Especially since these bugs have existed since the beginning.\r\n\r\nYour second statement seems to say, \"Since this behavior has existed since the beginning of time we don't want to change it and break existing code\".   \r\n\r\nSo a bug (or even a bad design decision) that has existed since the beginning of time will never be fixed because it would break existing code?   IMHO, that does not seem like a very good business decision to me.\r\n\r\nThe issue is not a matter of getting results different than would be expected (expectations can be changed) or different than the behavior of pretty much every other copy type utility out there, the issue is that it does not produce consistent results as demonstrated by my examples.\r\n\r\nAs a developer, you are well aware that intermittent bugs which produce inconsistent results are some of the most challenging ones to debug and fix.   \r\n\r\nWhy would anyone want to write important production quality code which uses functionality which does not produce consistent results?   \r\n\r\nWe both know the answer to that.....They wouldn't.\r\n\r\nWhen PS was first released I immediately found those bugs (and reported them to MS) and figured that they'd be fixed quickly so I delayed using the PS for anything important to wait for it to mature some more.   \r\n\r\nWhen they were not fixed in subsequent releases and I wanted to start using PS, I did what probably many others have done.  I used PS but avoided using those built in features that did not work properly or in a reliable way and instead used external functionality which worked properly, however, I certainly did not expect that 7 major versions later this situation would not have been addressed.\r\n\r\nWhen there are cracks in the foundation or the core building blocks it seems prudent to focus on those areas to strength the product so that users are not forced to look for external solutions that should be covered by internal functionality.\r\n\r\nIt is troubling to see this not being treated as the serious bug that it is",

The same code run multiple times does not produce the same results.\r\n\r\nBefore taking the time to write up that bug and all the various situations, I spent CONSIDERABLE\r\ntime trying various syntax (trailing slashes, *, *.*, and others) to try and find a single syntax\r\nthat would produce a consistent result and did not find any for the uses cases described.\r\n\r\nA good developer is not going to write new code using existing code which does not produce repeatable results because then their code also becomes unreliable.\r\n\r\nI'll bet that most PS developers have taken the route that I have which is to use external tools to\r\nperform that functionality in their code so that they can get consistent repeatable results.\r\n\r\nI take breaking code issues quite seriously too, however, when the original code is broke in the first\r\nplace, it makes sense to fix it regardless of whether it would break \"other\" code.\r\n\r\nImagine if the existing Copy-Item had a bug where it deleted the file after it copied it.  Using the\r\nanswer you provided, that would not be addressed because it might break existing code that depended on that bug.  I cannot imagine anyone considering that a good reason or answer.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I wrote all that up and reviewed it, however, there were also examples where\r\ndata loss occurs because there was no warning or confirmation.   That certainly goes against the\r\nbasic PS design principles of not doing harm without a warning.\r\n\r\nWhile I appreciate that you opened the issue for FileSystemProvider V2, I am quite skeptical that it will ever occur based on your response here, your comment about \"if #5785 ever gets done\", and the fact that these issues have gone unaddressed pretty much since the beginning of PS.\r\n\r\nRegardless of whether the existing code is fixed or whether a V2 is created, there should still\r\nbe a desire to provide this basic functionality in the product, especially one that is marketed\r\nas the replacement for all of the other shells.\r\n\r\nI really hope that someone take up the task of addressing this.\r\n\r\n",
