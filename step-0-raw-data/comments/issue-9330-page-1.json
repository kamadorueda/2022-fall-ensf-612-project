    "body": "I wouldn't classify it as a quirk, its actually intentional, and comes from the DOS days when all _files_ had an inherent period at the end of their names.   At that time, the period was a field separator, separating the name from the extension (and the period was not stored on disk), and of course only one period was allowed, the separator.   Today in Windows, the last period in any pattern is considered to be that same separator between name and extension, and so receives special treatment, but yet does not stop it from matching other patterns that might also include a `.` before the actual extension, because in some ways you might consider the extension of a file to have multiple periods.\r\n\r\nNote that `DIR *.` in CMD will match any file or directory either doesn't have a '.' or that the only '.' is at the beginning of the file name, as a period at the beginning of a file name is not considered to be defining an extension, since the name field would be empty, and that is not allowed.\r\n",

Also, [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file) recommend against creating such a file.\r\n\r\n> Do not end a file or directory name with a space or a period.
