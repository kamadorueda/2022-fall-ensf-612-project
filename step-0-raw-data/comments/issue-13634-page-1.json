Is it reasonable to log a non-fatal error somewhere and continue with the \"not a reparse point\" case for all errors?",

The question is, how reliably does PowerShell know if something goes wrong?\r\n\r\nIf possible I'd prefer this not to be a subtle behaviour that people are forced to use a trace to unravel. I suspect many users would be mystified by it, not use a trace, and either give up or open an issue, where they'll tell us that we should be throwing an error.\r\n\r\nRather, we can include it in the trace, but if we end up throwing an error at the end of the action, it might be nice to include the information from the reparse point processing.",
