You'll get that message in the StatusMessage property of the object returned by Set-AuthenticodeSignature or Get-AuthenticodeSignature (a `System.Management.Automation.Signature` object instance). \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Signature = Get-AuthenticodeSignature C:\\Windows\\System32\\kernel32.dll\r\n$Signature.StatusMessage\r\n```\r\n\r\nA StatusMessage of `A certificate chain processed, but terminated in a root certificate which is not trusted by the trust provider` will indicate that the certificate used to sign the code being validated does not chain to a trusted root certificate, which is often the case when signing with a self-signed certificate. If you're encountering that message, then assuming you accept the risk of trusting your cert, you can follow along with the instructions in the thread above.\r\n\r\nI hope that helps!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMatt",
