    "body": "Nah the reason is NOT using GetVersionEx. It works fine in Windows 10. You're referring to a right documentation though. The exe of that PowerShell _lacks manifestation_, as you can see it is reporting Windows 8.1.\n\nGetVersionInfo seems not to be a Win32 API, can you find a documentation on it? As far as I know, Microsoft only recommends using version helper functions (hmmm I'd have to say many programmers aren't logical enough to correctly check version numbers so MS is providing helper functions haha). And for getting the native system information, use GetFileVersionInfo. GetVersionEx returns the compatibility mode version number and if the app is not manifested for Windows 8.1/10, VersionLie shim gets in.\n",

Calling kernel32!GetVersionEx() directly will be shimmed and will return the\r\n> * fake OS version. In order to avoid this the call to getVersionEx is made via mscoree.dll.\r\n> * Mscoree.dll resides in system32 dir and is never lied about OS version.\r\n> */\r\n \r\n   * It sounds like .NET _Core_, which I presume doesn't use `mscoree.dll`, cannot take advantage of this, which is why the Core edition reports the fake version.\r\n\r\n* It is hard to believe, but [the method that the official docs recommend for determining the _true_ Windows version number](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms724429(v=vs.85).aspx) is:\r\n\r\n> call the GetFileVersionInfo function on one of the system DLLs, such as Kernel32.dll, then call VerQueryValue to obtain the \\\\StringFileInfo\\\\<lang><codepage>\\\\ProductVersion sub-block of the file version information.\"\r\n\r\nTo put it in PowerShell terms (Windows-only):  \r\n`(Get-FileVersionInfo $env:SystemRoot\\System32\\kernel32.dll).ProductVersion`",
