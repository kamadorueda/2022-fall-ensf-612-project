    "body": "> he expects that $propertiesToExclude is not empty and therefore Select-Object output type is always PSCustomobject. So if the logic return empty (ex.: user select all fields) and now output type is a source type then it is an unexpected result and unwanted.\n\nInteresting, I didn't think of it in this way ðŸ˜„ But it would be very rare that the user cares about the type of the returned object. Instead, the user would just access the members of the returned object, so I don't see the difference between `Process` and `PSCustomObject` is a big deal.\n\nThe main problem I found in the following example is what the experience would be when `$propertiesToExclude` is empty while `-ExpandProperty` is specified. In this case, if we assume `-Property *`, then all properties from the input object will be attached to the value object of `expand-property`, which I think will be very surprising to the user.\n\n```\n... | Select-Object -ExcludeProperty $propertiesToExclude -ExpandProperty <expand-property>\n```\n\nA more concrete (but unreal) example would be this:\n\n```\ngps -Id $pid | Select-Object -ExcludeProperty @() -ExpandProperty Modules\n```\n\n---\n\n@iSazonov After some more thinking on it, maybe I'm wrong. Maybe when user specify `Select-Object -ExcludeProperty @() -ExpandProperty <expand-property>`, they do want all properties from the input object to be attached to the expanded property. When the specified array is not empty, they mean \"_attach all properties from input object except the ones I specified_\", so when the specified array is empty, they just mean \"_attach all properties from input object with no exception_\".\n\nI think maybe it's a good idea to not do this change, and wait on the feedback to see if we need further tweaking this.\nGiven that, I will close this PR. Thanks for all your input @iSazonov!\n",
