Currently they aren't supported by the grammar in that way, but variables are. Furthermore, there is rarely a need for them in most scripts (except maybe for passing a boolean value to a .NET method).\n\n`||` and `&&` have different semantics than `-or` and `-and` regarding return values and what happens with output. PowerShell not having `||` and `&&` can be annoying, but I'm fairly sure it doesn't exist so far because people haven't found a viable way how to make it work in an object-based shell where program output is the result of the expression running said program, for example.\n",
