Since we have a nice PowerShell parser that we know doesn't run any code, we read in the class definitions with it and then compile them to .NET IL. So the parser is already able to resolve PowerShell-class-defined types at parse time.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that we don't have a nice .NET IL parser that we know doesn't run any code (and we only need the IL metadata anyway, to discover what types are available). corefx [ships one](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/c45c7a7439ab2925d1a6e17e80f396a6bd35c17b/src/System.Reflection.Metadata), but it's pretty low level and documentation on it is sparse. Last time I wrote something using it, I used their tests for guidance. But it should be relatively straightforward.",

    "body": "> This might not be that useful to using assembly since using assembly needs to make the assembly actually loaded for its types to be used in IL emitting\r\n\r\nI think the scenario here was to make class definition that depends on `using assembly` and `using module` still safe, so that script files can be parsed and type check successfully without the risk of running an arbitrary DLL on the filesystem.\r\n\r\nMuch of this [isn't actually required](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6722), but the discussion in that issue seems to indicate a preference for going down that path.\r\n\r\nI suspect a lot of these implementation discussions should really be had secondary to a design review of classes in some sense, but the available tooling in .NET has moved to a point that makes more things possible.",
