As I said the original plan was only to get rid of the workarounds with \"early parsing\"...\r\nOn the other hand, it is good that this work is done - it will save us a lot of time in the future as PowerShell becomes more popular and requires more launching features (like pwshw, login shell and so on).\r\n\r\nAdditional notices:\r\n- I see I skipped some code paths in _xUnit_ tests (but Pester tests exist).

To be honest, I admit that I'm kinda afraid of PRs like this one -- it obviously has values but also has a high risk of regression -- which would take me a lot efforts to review to get to the point where I'm sort of confident to accept the PR. That's why I said \"_it's not easy for both you and me_\" 😄\r\n\r\n> I see I skipped some code paths in xUnit tests (but Pester tests exist).
