They need a simple way to wrap information into objects.

Can you (iSazonov) elaborate how you think classes could help here, and how the suggested approach is trickier than using classes? \r\n\r\nPlease consider that we are not in a situation where we own software projects and can design classes and constructors. In the intended target group you have to deal with raw information from a number of sources that are beyond own control, and need a way to wrap them into objects without knowing more than the most basic programming principles.",

    "body": "> Why not just store the data in a PSCustomObject in the first place?\r\n\r\nThat's a great comment. Most advanced scripters do. But as code review shows, even advanced programmers frequently resort to inappropriate ways like using `Add-Member` to create simple data objects. Entry-level and occasional scripters, which are the primary target group for this suggestion, almost never use [PSCustomObject] simply because they don't know or care much about types and hashtables.\r\n\r\nBasically, anything can be done in PowerShell via direct .NET and types. The ease of use of PowerShell however comes from generic cmdlets which by design shield .NET from the user. So one could argue that we could get rid of all cmdlets since the same can always be done using underlying .NET ;-). So I guess it's a matter of evaluating whether a given cmdlet is simple and reusable enough to be of value, not whether it is unique in what it does.",

In level 1 you learn how to discover and run individual commands, and in level 2 you learn how to couple multiple commands using pipeline and variables. These two levels are where most ITPro live that I encounter in the IT departments I visit every week, so to help them, new tools need to be in these levels.\r\n\r\nLevel 3 would involve hashtables and types, so yes you can argue that users should be at least educated to level 3 to make use of structured output.

Yes, we can create custom objects, or use the code in the function itself if we wanted to. But I've found myself trying to combine different arrays or hashtables into a single object (usually for a report or some such) before, and it always involves spending time coding/testing/retesting/etc. I know many ops people that would love to have this so they can get those reports for the audit guys breathing down their necks. \r\n\r\nJust my 2 cents.

    "body": "I like this idea and I think it would be great for all experience levels. Having a cmdlet for it means it's more discoverable and more natural to use, especially in oneliners.\r\n\r\nThe naming is good from a discoverability perspective as it will be easy to find on your favorite search engine. It does feel \"wrong\" when looking at the current cmdlets and their naming as it doesn't follow the verb-noun style.\r\n\r\nHow about naming it `ConvertTo-Object` to fit into the naming style? It would make it natural to also have a `ConvertFrom-Object` that does the opposite transformation. The downside is that it might be less discoverable on the name alone.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction ConvertTo-Object\r\n{\r\n    param\r\n    (\r\n        [Object[]]\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory,ValueFromPipeline, ParameterSetName=\"Array\")]\r\n        $InputArray,\r\n  \r\n        [String[]]\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory, ParameterSetName=\"Array\")]\r\n        $PropertyName,\r\n        \r\n        [Switch]\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName=\"Array\")]\r\n        $DiscardRemaining,\r\n        \r\n        [Switch]\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName=\"Array\")]\r\n        $AsHashtable,\r\n\r\n        [HashTable]\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory,ValueFromPipeline, ParameterSetName=\"HashTable\")]\r\n        $InputHashTable,\r\n\r\n        [System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary]\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory,ValueFromPipeline, ParameterSetName=\"OrderedHashTable\")]\r\n        $InputOrdered,\r\n\r\n        [String[]]\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory=$false, ParameterSetName=\"OrderedHashTable\")]\r\n        $PropertyName,\r\n    )\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know if that design is technically feasible but it should get the idea across at least. The PropertyName parameter for OrderedDictionary would be to allow renaming properties. I don't think it would be sensible to have that for a HashTable as it would be unpredictable and confusing.\r\n\r\nA `ConvertFrom-Object` could look something like this\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction ConvertFrom-Object\r\n{\r\n    param\r\n    (\r\n        [Object]\r\n        [Parameter(Mandatory,ValueFromPipeline)]\r\n        $InputObject,\r\n        \r\n        [Switch]\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName=\"HashTable\")]\r\n        $AsHashtable,\r\n\r\n        [Switch]\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName=\"Array\")]\r\n        $AsArray\r\n    )\r\n...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thank you all so much for sharing thoughts. I am trying to sum a number of things up. Let me know if I missed anything.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAdd one or more cmdlets to expose object manipulation on discoverable cmdlet level rather than having to use .NET, type conversion, or classes:\r\n\r\n- Convert unstructured data (arrays) to objects/hashtables\r\n- Convert hashtables to objects\r\n- Convert objects to hashtables\r\n- Merge objects\r\n\r\n## Why is that needed?\r\n\r\nOccasional scripters work on cmdlet level and typically have no deep knowledge about types, hashtables, let alone classes. Even experienced scripters seem to often use `Add-Member` to compose simple data objects (rather than using [PSCustomObject] or classes) - likely because `Add-Member` is the only discoverable cmdlet in PowerShell that creates new objects (aside from `Select-Object` which isn't really appropriate in this context).\r\n\r\nThere is currently no intuitive self-learning path to go beyond `Add-Member` on cmdlet level.\r\n\r\nAll other techniques for object creation - however simple they may be - require extra knowledge, i.e. about hashtables or classes, which is an extra barrier for novice users still trying to cope with cmdlets and parameters. \r\n\r\nExperienced users can benefit from these cmdlets, too, as their feature set spans a very powerful range and allows for advanced object manipulation (i.e. sorting properties, removing empty values, merging objects). \r\n\r\n## Is this functionality really needed?\r\n\r\nAnything the proposed cmdlets do can be done via direct .NET access (type conversion, classes). So once you know how to create new objects via [PSCustomObject] or via classes, it is not much more complicated than using the proposed cmdlets.\r\n\r\nYet this proposal was not about teaching PowerShell new tricks in the first place. It is a proposal to lower the barrier for entry-level or occational scripters, and provide generic solutions for common object manipulation tasks.\r\n\r\nThis approach is in good tradition with existing cmdlet design. Cmdlets often exist just to be discoverable or shield the user from .NET. Compare `Get-Alias` with `Get-ChildItem -Path alias:`, same with `Get-Variable`. Look at `Get-Date`: `[DateTime]::Now` isn't hard, either. 'Get-Date -Format yyyyMMdd' could as well be replaced by `[DateTime]::Now.ToString('yyyyMMdd')`. `Get-Process` could be replaced by equally simple `[System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetProcesses()`, etc. pp.\r\n\r\nAnd still there is consensus that it is a great thing that `Get-Date`, `Get-Process` and other cmdlets exist even though they don't really do anything new. Cmdlets exist to be discoverable and versatile.\r\n\r\n## How expensive is it?\r\n\r\nImplenting the proposed cmdlets is trivial from an engineering point of view. There are no dependencies nor would the package grow. All proof-of-concept functions in this thread are short functions which essentially just wrap a discoverable user interface around the existing PowerShell capabilities.\r\n\r\n## Next steps\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to collect the functionality commonly needed to convert unstructured data to structured data and vice versa. Once we know what the feature set should be, we can start composing a cmdlet family and think about naming.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\nA prototype module can be developed and hosted on github and the gallery so everyone was invited to add ideas or participate in dev or testing. \r\n\r\nPrereq would be that we get a general thumbs up from the PowerShell working group that ultimately this module can become part of the shipping modules. The proposed cmdlets make no sense if they stay put in a 3rd party module since the target group isn't familiar with the gallery and shouldn't be discriminated in a way that their scripts would only run with a 3rd party helper module being installed.\r\n",

We propose a change to `New-Object` parameter set that takes a hashtable and emit a PSCustomObject.  This is more discoverable than casting a hashtable to a `[PSCustomObject]` for new users.  A `-TypeName` taking an array of strings should also be considered for custom typing (used with formatting).  This should be a bucket 3 breaking change where currently a hashtable doesn't emit something useful used with `New-Object`",
