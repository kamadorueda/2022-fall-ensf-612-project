    "body": "Short answer: that's just how PowerShell formatting system works.\nLong answer will take too much time, so here is _medium-size compromise_ version\n\nLet's take a look at this code\n\n``` powershell\n$h = @{1 = 'a'; 2 = 'b'}\n$h\nWrite-Host '======='\n$h\nWrite-Host '======='\n$h\n```\n\nThere are two separate routes in this code that both are ending up on the screen:\n1. Objects output (three `$h` expression invocations)\n2. `Write-Host` invocations.\n\nNote that these two methods are **deeply** different in Powershell.\nFor example, let's tweak the code this way\n\n``` powershell\nPS C:\\src\\powershell> $a = ./headers.ps1                                                                                                              \n=======\n=======\nPS C:\\src\\powershell> $a\n\nName                           Value                                                                                                                                  \n----                           -----                                                                                                                                  \n2                              b                                                                                                                                      \n1                              a                                                                                                                                      \n2                              b                                                                                                                                      \n1                              a                                                                                                                                      \n2                              b                                                                                                                                      \n1                              a                                                                                                                                      \n```\n\nAs you can see, you can manipulate `$h` objects, but everything from `Write-Host` goes straight to the screen. As I side-note, [here](http://www.jsnover.com/blog/2013/12/07/write-host-considered-harmful/) is a great post from @jpsnover about `Write-Host` usage.\n\nSo we can take `Write-Host` out from the equation.\nWe are ending up with this\n\n```\n$h = @{1 = 'a'; 2 = 'b'}\n$h\n$h\n$h\n```\n\nNow, we need to talk about PowerShell formatting system.\n\nEvery object type has formatting rules. They are applied in two cases:\n- When objects are written to the console (and user see the output).\n- When they are formatted with `Out-String` cmdlet.\n\nThere are two most used formatting groups:\n- Tables\n- Lists\n\nIt's important to point out, that although every object has default formatting, it's not locked **just** to this formatting.\nDefault formatting goal is to provide a good interactive experience to all users across the board.\n[Here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/getting-started/cookbooks/using-format-commands-to-change-output-view) you can find documentation about changing object representation.\nYou can also use `Update-TypeData` command to globally change default formatting for types, if you don't like them. All these changes will only result in the view change, objects would still be the same.\n\nWe are one step away from finishing the explanation. The last step is \"why there is only one header for table formatting\"?\nI found [another great post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2006/04/29/how-powershell-formatting-and-outputting-really-works/) (again from @jpsnover) that explains it\n\n> Now, if there is not a registered view for a datatype, then Out-Default looks at the FIRST OBJECT IN THE STREAM to determine how many properties the object has 5 or more properties, it send the ENTIRE STREAM to Format-List, otherwise it sends the ENTIRE STREAM to Format-Table.  When it sends the stream to Format-Table, that command needs to generate columns.  It does this by looking at the properties of the FIRST OBJECT – those become the columns.  If the first Object has 2 properties, you’ll get a 2 column table even if all the other objects in the stream have 10 properties. \n\n@Liturgist does it answer your question?\n",

If so, then the formatters do not actually go into what many people think of as the pipeline; stdout.\n\nThere are many Write-\\* cmdlets. Would the following items seem to be similar for someone coming from a traditional C/*NIX environment? Are there other streams you would add here? How many default streams does PowerShell have?\n\n```\nWrite-Error - stderr\nWrite-Host - stdout\nWrite-Output - stdobj\n```\n\nIf I were to want to have headers written each time the formatter is invoked, what kind of things might I do?

    "body": "I cannot come up with a good use-case, but if you really want to have headers, you can do `ForEach-Object {$_ | Format-Table}`, like\n\n```\n> @{'foo' = '1'}, @{'2' = '2'} | ForEach-Object {$_ | Format-Table}\n\n\nName                           Value                                                                                                                                  \n----                           -----                                                                                                                                  \nfoo                            1                                                                                                                                      \n\n\n\nName                           Value                                                                                                                                  \n----                           -----                                                                                                                                  \n2                              2  \n```\n\nFormatter emits only one header for table, regardless of the types of objects.\nFor example\n\n```\nPS > New-Object -TypeName psobject -Property @{'foo' = 'foo'; 'bar' = 'bar'};  New-Object -TypeName psobject -Property @{'foo' = 'foo'; 'baz' = 'baz'}                                                                                                                                                      \n\nbar foo\n--- ---\nbar foo\n    foo\n\n```\n\nIt may seems that information is lost in this example (the `baz` column), but it's not. It's just that formatting uses only the first objects for columns. That's exactly what @jpsnover covered in great details in https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2006/04/29/how-powershell-formatting-and-outputting-really-works/\n\nThere are 6 streams, i.e. \n\n```\nPS > 'foo' 6> 1 \nfoo\n\n\nPS > 'foo' 7> 1                                                                                                                      \nAt line:1 char:7\n+ 'foo' 7> 1\n+       ~~\nUnexpected token '7>' in expression or statement.\n    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnexpectedToken\n```\n\n1 - stdout\n2 - stderr\n3 - verbose\n4 - information\n5 - debug\n6 - ??\n\nI could mess up 3, 4, 5 maybe they have a different order. :)\n\nThe one that you named `stdobj` is the pipeline one. I would not call it a separate stream. When PowerShell and OS interacts (i.e. to file redirection) it actually acts like `stdout`.\n",

Particularly, all streams higher than 2 are one or another form of information logging. The stream number really represents severity (less is more important).\nI wrote thousands of PowerShell lines without using `Write-Debug`, `Write-Information` or any stream higher than 2 directly.\n\nI'd like to [quote](http://www.jsnover.com/blog/2013/12/07/write-host-considered-harmful/) Jeffrey one more time\n\n> Using Write-Host is almost always wrong.\n",
