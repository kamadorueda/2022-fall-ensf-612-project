Fortunately regenerating the script block is pretty cheap using the existing (internal) APIs. I'm guessing @PaulHigin is doing this for thread jobs but not for `foreach -parallel`. Paul?\r\n\r\nBTW - another thing to check out are classes. An instance of a PowerShell class is also affinitized to the runspace where it was created, so passing that instance to another runspace won't work reliably.",
