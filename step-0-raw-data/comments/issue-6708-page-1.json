And should it return the entries in the `psd1` (reflecting the psd1 contents) or should it always return an empty array, reflecting what is actually imported? The property name would imply the former, but in reality, it typically is what is imported.",

    "body": "Currently, `ModuleInfo.ExportedWorkflows` returns an empty `Dictionary<string, FunctionInfo>` (_not changed in this PR_). I think the current behavior makes sense. We don't support `XAML` module and don't support the `workflow` keyword in the script, so there is no way to import a module that declares any workflow in it.\r\n\r\nAs to `Get-Module -list`, for a script module that has `workflow foo {}` defined in it, the module analysis does find `foo` as an exported module member, but consider `foo` to be a function (_this seems wrong to me, module analysis probably shouldn't return any exported commands in case a `workflow` definition is found in AST, because that module won't be able to be loaded_). The `ExportedWorkflows` property of the returned `PSModuleInfo` object is still an empty dictionary.",
