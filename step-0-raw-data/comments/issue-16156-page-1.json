We have no intention of dropping support for System.Data.SqlClient any time soon. It will remain as-is and we will fix important bugs and security issues as they arise. If you have a typical application that doesnâ€™t use any of the newest SQL features, then you will still be well served by a stable and reliable System.Data.SqlClient for many years.\r\n\r\nThat means the `System.Data.SqlClient` will still be patched with security fixes, though not all bug fixes. So I guess it's fine to keep it in PowerShell, and add the new `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`. Thoughts? @TravisEz13 @adityapatwardhan @PaulHigin",
