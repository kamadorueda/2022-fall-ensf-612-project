    "body": "First is the “why”: the original PS team (including you :-)) created the gci output based on what the Windows OS provides without performance bottlenecks: in Windows, there is no directory size so it has to be computed which is very time consuming (or does folder “size” reports just the number of files which might be easier to report?). The owner information, too, is not part of the directory info but instead a separate security API call. So I can totally see *why* gci output is this limited (for performance reasons). \r\nThen is the question about regression: does your implementation run on Windows? All the massive effort to create a cross-platform script language would easily be counter-striked if core cmdlets output was platform specific and not/not as readily available on all platforms.\r\nSo in a nutshell, if you target something that makes gci output richer on all platforms without causing incompatibilities or performance hits, that’s awesome. I can see an enhanced mode display, or even a different DateTime format (although for consistency, this calls for a change in the DateTime.toString() on engine level rather than implemented just for one specific cmdlet). \r\n\r\nIf gci output became platform specific, I’d recommend using the *nix “ls” command in the first place. That would clearly hint that the solution is designed for a specific platform.\r\nMaybe a compromise could be a set of ps1xml files (i.e. linuxPack) that tweaks the object display for that platform for those who are predominantly working with that platform and want to feel more at home.\r\n\r\nI just wonder: if gci output shows useful props such as “Size” (that may only be avail on some platforms due to tech reasons), then people will inevitably start using these props in scripts, too, and these scripts will start to be platform specific again. Is that what we want?\r\n\r\nOr did I misunderstand the question?",
