    "body": "## Broken Tests\r\n\r\nTwo test patterns are currently broke.  The reason for this is that this PR implements a more specific `$` variable interpolation detection to require the argument to be quoted.  The implementation is that, if a `$` character is not followed by a legitimate variable character, that `$` will not itself require the argument to be quoted.\r\n\r\nPatterns failing:\r\n- a file path completion test where `$` appears at the end of the completion\r\n- a Windows only miscellaneous completion test where `$` appears followed by a `\\` in the completion.\r\n\r\nBoth test patterns involve command completions, so the quoting of the path resulted in the completion using the invoke operator `&`.  With this PR's implementation, the quoting and the invoke operator no longer occur.\r\n\r\n## Tests Needed\r\n- Member completion quoting tests, these should probably be similar to the two examples that were previously commented in the code, as I haven't found any tests for them yet, in addition to tests relating to issue #10198.\r\n- Variable completion tests\r\n   - test completions of variable names that require braces and quoting and escaping both for access and for use as an argument.\r\n   - test completions of variable names that have colons in their names, both with and without a scope specified.\r\n   - test completions of variable names that start with `?` but with more than one character, with scope, with complex character requring braces, with scope and complex character, without scope and without complex character.\r\n- Argument value completion tests\r\n   - test escaping of wildcard patterns in a completion for a parameter which accepts them. __\\*\\* IMPORTANT for other work being done around the WildCardPattern class  \\*\\*__\r\n   - test quoting and escaping of curly quoting characters.\r\n   - On Unix OS's test completion of a file name with wildcard characters `*` and `?` (with a parameter supporting wildcards) and doublequotes.  Tests should also be added to other areas to insure these files or folders are accessible, but that is not the scope of this PR (these tests will need to create said files though).\r\n - test `ValidateSetAttribute` completed arguments that require quoting, especially regarding those that could be confused as a parameter name when not quoted.  Include variants related to issue #10218.\r\n\r\nWe'll keep adding to this list to track the tests fixed, needed and added.",
