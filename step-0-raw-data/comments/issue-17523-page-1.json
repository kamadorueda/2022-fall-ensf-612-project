    "body": "PowerShell relies on [System.Diagnostics.Process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process?view=net-6.0) to parse the output from a pipe and in the absence of an explicit setting of the `Standard*Encoding` property in the start info it will rely on the global setting of `Console.OutputEncoding` to determine what encoding is used. On Windows the default console encoding is still whatever the OS is configured to, which is typically 431 on English hosts.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately your only workaround here is to set `[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8` and then run your command\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8\r\npython .\\test.py | echo\r\n```\r\n\r\nEven then it's still going to read the BOM as text and not a marker so it's not perfect but you at least get the proper string back.\r\n\r\nAlso keep in mind not all executables use the console output encoding as the encoding they write to stdout/stderr as. Some completely ignore the setting and always use UTF-8, others will use some other setting somewhere to control this. PowerShell is just using whatever the console encoding is set to (rights so IMO). If you want to deal with UTF-8 everywhere I recommend adding this to your profile\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# UTF8Encoding is used instead of the UTF8 field to set a BOM-less encoding for writing to stdin\r\n[Console]::OutputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding = $OutputEncoding = [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::new($false)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPython is a clear example of a program that doesn't use the console codepage. It actually uses the system locale, which on US English hosts is `windows-1252`. If in your example you didn't use `sys.stdout.buffer` but wrote text to `sys.stdout` then getting back UTF-8 requires even more work on the Python side. You can force it to use a specific encoding with the `PYTHONIOENCODING` env var or by calling Python with `python.exe -X utf8` to use UTF-8, e.g.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = 'utf-8'\r\n[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8\r\npython -c \"print('äöüß αβγδ')\" | echo\r\n\r\n$env:PYTHONIOENCODING = ''  # Unsets env var for test\r\npython -X utf8 -c \"print('äöüß αβγδ')\" | echo\r\n```",

    "body": "Hey Jordan!\r\n\r\nThank you for your explanation of what's going on behind the scenes. \r\n\r\nTo be clear I am not really advocating adding a BOM to UTF-8 output. I only did it to signal to PowerShell what encoding I'm using.\r\n\r\nI knew about `[Console]::OutputEncoding` but I viewed setting it more as a workaround to be honest. I think it is preferable to provide as a \"marker\" for lack of a better term to help PowerShell process the data regardless of user settings over telling the end user of my scripts to change their output encoding before running them.\r\n\r\nI wanted the code for repoducing the issue be short but what I am actually doing is checking if the output handle is a console window or not. If it is I set the code page to UTF-8 and output UTF-8 without BOM to avoid the artifact you mentioned. If it is not a console window but a pipe I output UTF-8 with BOM to allow PowerShell to pipe correctly. As I said this works in version 5.1 but not in the current release.\r\n\r\nIf this difference in the behaviour of the pipes between PowerShell 5.1 and the current release is in fact the intended behaviour feel free to close this issue.",

'\r\n\r\nWhen I saw your discussion, I burst into tears.\r\n\"No one defines the coding standard of powershell standard input and standard output\" ----- I think this is the biggest mistake of powershell.\r\nA \"bom2\" similar to the bom header should actually be defined to standardize this.\r\n\r\nLet me talk about my thoughts:\r\n1 Design a bom2 as a logo header. The string used to identify the header will be automatically recognized by powershell, translated into the target encoding, and output in the current powershell console.\r\n\r\n2 This solution must be able to express emoj on win without relying on win terminal\r\n\r\n3Q: What encoding scheme is used? A: I recommend only using utf8.\r\nBecause of utf16, only 65535 characters can be used. utf32 is actually unused and should be considered obsolete.\r\n\r\n4Q: Does it support multiple encodings? A: I recommend: No.\r\n\r\n5Q: If multiple encodings are supported, do you want to default base64 encoding and decoding? A: I suggest: yes.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate purpose of doing these things: support emoj, unified encoding, no garbled characters.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nThis is the solution I think works so far: base64 encode, decode\r\n\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\nimport sys\r\nimport base64\r\n\r\naaa = 'write-host \"中文\"'\r\nbbb = base64.b64encode(aaa.encode(\"utf_16_le\"))\r\nsys.stdout.buffer.write(bbb)\r\n#$base64_cmd = 'dwByAGkAdABlAC0AaABvAHMAdAAgACIALU6HZSIA'\r\n#powershell.exe -EncodedCommand $base64_cmd\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is also a temporary solution: \r\nwrite the information, plus the bom header, to a file.

Even PowerShell changed their default encoding for the `Out-File` cmdlet to UTF8 without BOM in later versions.\r\n\r\nIf you want to argue that it would be nice to have a marker indicating the encoding of the file that's fine but this issue is not about text encoding in general - that's a much larger topic and the PowerShell issue tracker probably wouldn't be the place I'd raise it.\r\n\r\n> \"my string eg : ⭐🌛\" | my.exe ----Emojis have nothing to do with it?\r\n\r\nWhether the payload text includes emojis or not doesn't matter for what I'm talking about.\r\n\r\nLook, I'm not trying to say your concerns are not valid.

    "body": "I investigated this issue some more trying to understand the discrepancy in this behavior between WinPS 5.1 and PS 7.2. It turns out this is because PowerShell 7 changed how to read a process' standard output:\r\n- WinPS uses `Process.StandardOutput`, which is a `StreamReader`, while PS 7 uses the `OutputDataReceived` event handler.\r\n\r\nWhen using `OutputDataReceived`, the behavior is the same on both .NET and .NET Framework -- BOM is NOT respected and `Console.OutputEncoding` is used for encoding bytes to string.\r\nWhen using `Process.StandardOutput`, the behavior is also the same on both .NET and .NET Framework -- BOM is respected by the `StreamReader`.\r\n\r\nSwitching to `OutputDataReceived` was part of a [big change](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/2450) back in 2016 to support streaming behavior in a pipeline of native commands. I will let the Engine Group to review this issue again.",

The `[Console]::OutputEncoding` works but it's a process wide setting so can get very messy when you start dealing with multiple runspaces in the same thread.\r\n\r\nNothing is going to be foolproof, console encoding is difficult as every native command uses their own rules. Some respect the console codepage, others hardcode to UTF-8, some use UTF-16-LE, and there are also the ones that hardcode to something different altogether. Keeping a sane default (console encoding) but with a safe way to override in the Runspace fits the bill nicely IMO.",
