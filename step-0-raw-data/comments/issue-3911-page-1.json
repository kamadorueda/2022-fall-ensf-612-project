    "body": "By pulling this out into its own issue, you have discarded the idea that ```Get-Content``` without ```-Raw``` and without using ```-Encoding Byte``` should return an empty string if the file does not contain any characters. There are good arguments indicating that having ```Get-Content``` behave differently for empty files than it does for files with one line and differently than it does for files with more than one line is just confusing. That idea should not be discarded just because you don't agree with it. It should be included in this issue as a point of discussion, awaiting input from the PowerShell Team to determine what can/will be done, if anything, with this issue.",

    "body": "> having Get-Content behave differently for empty files than it does for files with one line and differently than it does for files with more than one line is just confusing.\r\n\r\n* The one-item collection case (one-line case here) is not specific to `Get-Content` at all: it is at the heart of PowerShell, as has been mentioned: a one-item collection is _automatically_ unwrapped, _by PowerShell itself_, irrespective of what command produces it:\r\n\r\n   * This behavior is very convenient on the one hand, but, prior to v3, was a constant source of confusion and bugs: Because people thought that a cmdlet returned a _collection_, they didn't anticipate _not_ getting one if the cmdlet _happened to_ return just a _one-item_ collection that was automatically unwrapped.\r\n\r\n  * v3 ingeniously resolved this to retain the best of both worlds: even a scalar can now be treated like a collection, which means that you can consistently use `.Count` to count the number of items returned  and `[0]` to get the 1st item - whether there's only one or not. In other words: _we no longer need to worry about the special-casing of one-item results, and can live happily ever after in the collection mindset._\r\n     * On a side note: `foreach ($v in $null) { 'here' }` _not_ causing the loop to be entered strikes me as an inconsistency: a _scalar_ `$null` - as opposed to a _null collection_  - should be treated as an object to iterate over, just as happens with `$null | % { 'here' }`\r\n\r\nSo, now that cmdlets (with the appropriate options) that return _collections in principle_ can _consistently be treated as collections_ in the one- and multi-item cases, why should the _no_-item case be any different?\r\n\r\nAlso note that with your proposal a file made up of _just a newline_ would be treated the same as a zero-byte file.\r\nWith the collection approach, you'd get a null collection in the zero-byte file case, and an empty string in the just-a-newline case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
