So I ran the following script to look at loaded types, either from ```Add-Type``` or ```using assembly```:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nstart-transcript -path .\\outputFileName.txt\r\n[Runtime.Loader.AssemblyLoadContext]::Default.Assemblies.\r\nWhere{ $_.Location -like \"$publishDir*\" }.\r\nForEach{ $_.GetTypes().\r\n  Where{ $_.IsPublic }\r\n} | Format-Table -Property IsPublic, Name, Namespace\r\nstop-transcript\r\n```\r\n\r\nand what I noticed was quite weird.\r\n\r\nFor ```using assembly``` when running the first time the dependent types were missing, the second time a block of them were added and the third time a much smaller final block was added. I tried waiting a while after issuing ```using assembly``` but no you really do need to run the script 3 times.\r\n\r\nFor ```Add-Type``` when running the first time the first two blocks mentioned above were present, and the second time the final block from above was added.\r\n\r\nSo I shall always run this command 3 times in future (very strange) to see all loaded types.\r\n\r\nI also ran the above command with a C# PS module project after loading the dot-published DLL with ```using module``` and ```using assembly```. There ```using module``` seemed to pull in all dependencies but ```using assembly``` pulled in none, not even those which were used by a ```PSCmdlet```. Since this is my actual use case, a cmdlet with .NET input and output types, seems like I simply need to prefix client PS scripts with ```using module```.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts appreciated even though I'll close this now.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks @SeeminglyScience , I managed to get the same result from ```using module``` (3 runs) and ```using assembly``` (4 runs) by adding a non-PSCmdlet class with a dependency. So seems ```using assembly``` ignores PSCmdlet dependencies which is no good if these are the only dependencies and we want to expose .NET types related to these....\r\n\r\nI proved this by dot-publishing the PS binary module with only the PSCmdlet class (with a .NET class input coming from a dependency) and then trying to create an input (.NET class) for the cmdlet:\r\n```powershell\r\n[PSCmdletInputType]::new()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis succeeded with ```using module``` but not ```using assembly``` (error: ```InvalidOperation: Unable to find type [PSCmdletInputType].```\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is a bug or design behaviour.\r\n",
