As you mentioned, `-match` and other operators already do this. \r\n\r\nNot to mention that your regex example fundamentally isn't *indexing*, it's *filtering*, which is not really what the operator is for.",

    "body": "Agreed, `$n -match '^f'` seems like a concise-enough and more readable idiom  to me. (`@($n) -match '^f'`, if `$n` could be a scalar).\r\n\r\nConceptual issues aside, the proposed `$n['^f']`syntax is _ambiguous_ and could break existing scripts, given that the following currently works:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$ndx = '1'  # index as string (nothing you'd do intentionally, but it could happen)\r\n$n[$ndx]  # -> 'bar' - string index was automatically coerced to [int].\r\n          #  How do you distinguish it from regex '1'?\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile `$n('^f')` doesn't clash with existing behavior, it strikes me as obscure and too similar to a method call.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
