    "body": "No, adding a callback is no help (I left it out because it is not important to the repro). And it makes sense that having a callback or not is relevant to the problem: if `$traceEventSource.Process()` were complaining that I was not using it right, that would imply that the `Process()` method was being called... but it cannot be, because PS failed during binding.\r\n\r\nAlso, the problem can be worked around by using `Add-Type` to add some C# code to call the `Process()` method, which then works with no problem. And it works fine without adding any callbacks (though it is not useful, of course).\r\n\r\nThis error is strange to me, because I don't recall ever having seen a binder error before. What is so special about this no-argument, bool-returning method?!\r\n\r\nP.S. To anybody actually trying to use the TraceEvents.dll library from PowerShell, I would recommend NOT using `TraceEventSource` anyway; use `TraceLog` instead, which reads in all the events up-front and then you can slice-n-dice in PS.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$traceLog = [Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.Etlx.TraceLog]::OpenOrConvert( $etlFile )\r\n```",
