As soon as you read a value from `$input`, that value is no longer available from `$input`. It's better to treat `$input` as a function that outputs a value once rather than something you can continually pull the current value from.\r\n\r\nNot sure why `$input` needs to be used here, I would think `$_` is a more natural choice, especially since it doesn't have this rather annoying pitfall. Perhaps @PaulHigin can speak to the design decision there.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, using `$input` for threadjobs is probably not the best idea, but if that's how it's presently designed... 🤷‍♂ ",

You can still access it, it'll even still be the same exact object, it's state is just different.  It's sort of like if you've ever used `adsisearcher`.  If you've already ran a `Find` method you wouldn't expect it to automatically reset itself so you can get the same object back when you run the method again.  Same thing here, `$input` is an enumerator; after you enumerate, it's not going to reset itself.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I'd recommend just pretending `$input` doesn't exist. It's basically the only place in PowerShell you need to actually know what an enumerator is and how it works for anything to be consistent.  There's not much that can be done about it now since changing it would be a breaking change, but I really wish that was never an enumerator.\r\n\r\nInstead, use a process block:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem | Start-ThreadJob { process { $_ } } | Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Also note that this doesn't really have anything to do with jobs, `gci | & { $input; $input }` has the same problems)",

    "body": "> I think the issue here is partially design decision (`-InputObject` is _only_ assigned to `$input`, not `$_`, in a scriptblock sent to a Start-Job or Start-ThreadJob cmdlet)\r\n\r\nPart of the complication there is that if you are going to set `$_`, then you can't really have named blocks.  Otherwise actually adding `process` block is confusing.  Also if you're going to make it an implicit process block (or rather, act like one) similar to `ForEach-Object` then that (to me) implies that it's creating a job per pipeline object.\r\n\r\nAfaik there's no way to directly set `$_` without using one of the `ScriptBlock.Invoke*` methods, none of which will allow explicit named blocks.  Even if there is another way, I'm not sure what it would set it to. For example, in a `begin` block, there wouldn't be anything to set it to.\r\n\r\n> and part documentation -- the _only_ example in [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/threadjob/start-threadjob?view=powershell-6) using `-InputObject` also recommends using `$input` rather than a `process{}` block as you illustrated.\r\n> \r\n> We've kinda sent folx directly into the pitfall here.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see that changed, but I don't really blame whoever wrote that.\r\n\r\n1. At a glance, `$input` seems to do what you want.  That's why it's an easy trap to fall into, even for experienced folks\r\n\r\n1. Folks with a CS background don't think twice about it (I assume anyway).  I imagine enumerators are a concept that's taught pretty early on, so it's probably routine\r\n\r\n1. I can't recall seeing anyone else talk about why it's confusing, nor can I remember seeing other folks recommend against it's use.  I'm not sure that it is a popular sentiment",
