    "body": "Most if not all of these issues will be primarily due to some build steps not always being taken.\r\n\r\nWhen building pwsh, it's best to use the provided `build.psm1` module located at the root of the repo. The main command from it you'll be using is `Start-PSBuild`\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any issues when building, I'd also add the `-Clean` switch. This will resolve the first issue, and likely most or all of the others. Not all build steps are taken by default, but a clean build is required at least once, and then often again as needed as you update your local copy of the repo, to ensure you also have an updated copy of all the files, many of which are generated during the build.",
