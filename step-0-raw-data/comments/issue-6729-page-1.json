It seems that `zsh` does support redirection to multiple files matching the wildcard while `bash` complains that the destination is ambiguous.  Also given that there seems to be legitimate cases where you want to initialize multiple files to the same content, then we think this is not a bucket 3 breaking change.  Also, if `-WhatIf` is used with `Set-Content` it does inform you of what was matched and would be written.  As noted, `Out-File` restricts to matching a single file so we have a bit of inconsistency between `Out-File` and `Set-Content`, but those two cmdlets don't have to be identical otherwise they'd be a single cmdlet.  We believe this is `By Design`",

    "body": "> As noted, `Out-File` restricts to matching a single file so we have a bit of inconsistency between `Out-File` and `Set-Content`, but those two cmdlets don't have to be identical otherwise they'd be a single cmdlet. We believe this is `By Design`\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT Please clarify. Out-File (and >,>>) uses `-FilePath` by default. This works like `-Path` with globbing but with returning only one path. And question is should we switch the default to LiteralPath in all scenarios (if we get path from pipeline we already bind to LiteralPath by PSPath).",
