So you could do something like\r\n```\r\nSplit-Path -Path '/asdf/asdf.foo' -LeafBase\r\nasdf\r\n```\r\nAnd it won't give you an error that it doesn't exist.  So for your example, $PSHOME, you know it is a directory, but Split-Path doesn't.  To get what you want, you could do something like:\r\n```\r\n(Get-Item -Path $PSHOME).BaseName\r\n6.0.0-rc.2\r\n```\r\nBut that works because the object returned from Get-Item in this case is an IO.DirectoryInfo object.  If the item doesn't exist, you'll have to worry about handling the resulting error.",
