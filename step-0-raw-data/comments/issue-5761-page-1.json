    "body": "@markekraus My first design attempt is to support `@[]`, behaving like `@()`, see PR #5762. However, unlike character `')'` that always starts a new token, the character `']'` doesn't force to start a new token and therefore can be included in `GenericToken`, meaning command names, arguments, function names and etc. It makes impossible to determine where `'@[]'` ends and I cannot find an elegant solution without breaking changes.\r\n\r\nWe need more discussions on the design, and that is why I submitted 2 PRs for the list support: #5762 to add `@[]`, and this one to add `[]`.\r\n",
