I guess this could be more a problem if you open a powershell.exe shell for a long time or script that are running for days.\n\nAre there another issues? If there arent, how could i have a try at this and try run some powershell code on mono? First step could be get it running and then fix memory leaks or other issues.\n\nI have opened the bug for mono here:\nhttps://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=46569\n",

System.Runtime.Loader package reference has to be added manually to get System.Management.Automation compiled under netstandard2.0, but this package is just a stub so it will fail at runtime if mono/.net framework tries to load it.\r\n\r\nLuckily there is AppDomain in .NET Standard 2.0 which may provide sufficient API to replace AssemblyLoadContext, but rewriting these classes is certainly required and I don't know if PowerShell Core team will do this or not.
