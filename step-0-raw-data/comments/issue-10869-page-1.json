Also, this method call causes the loading of `System.Drawing.Primitive.dll` even if it's not handling a `System.Drawing` type because it needs to populate its cache. So I think we should probably just special case the `System.Drawing` types -- if `type.FullName` is one of `System.Drawing.Color`, `System.Drawing.Point`, `System.Drawing.Rectangle`, `System.Drawing.Size`, and `System.Drawing.SizeF`, then call `TypeDescriptor.GetConverter`.\r\n\r\nI know this is potentially cause a maintenance issue -- what if new intrinsic types are added to the cache?
