    "body": "Following on from #10873 ... **Short version: I think this should be done, and would be happy if it was done as described** \r\nLong version: \r\nThis does two things which I think are obviously missing from `wait-debugger` , conditional break, and printing a message about the reason for the break. I can't fault the way it does them, which has some history of experience behind it. In addition the pipeline/passthru support allows a scenario I hadn't thought about.   \r\n\r\nNames ... `-ConditionScript` feels clunky. Other cmdlets use `scriptblock`  (Doh!) or names which this parameter is _not_ -like  FilterScript (nothing is filtered out), so there's nothing obvious to re-use. I'd probably use \"when\" but tbh I don't think that's any better, and means an alias won't be enough for anyone switching over from `enter-debugger`. \r\nOn aliases, `breakpoint `is a good alias; it looks and functions like a language keyword, and it's self-explanatory. We're either writing \"I want a break point here\" (`breakpoint`) or \"go away to the debugger and come back\", in verb-noun form - `wait-debugger` needs to keep working and a case can be made for `Enter-Debugger` (obviously) among others. \r\nOn the _noun_ side I don't see a single use of of the noun \"debugger\" as a problem. Being pedantic, a breakpoint is a marker which triggers something, you can mark/unmark as a break-point (add/set/remove) but you can't enter/invoke/wait-for one. So I'd stick with `debugger`.   \r\nOn _verbs_: `Enter` and `Wait `both seem valid to me; the script waits for the debugger to _return_ ;  the action in the debugger is \"continue\" and wait/continue make a good pair. Depending on what has been stepped through things may not resume at the same place so it is not a perfect \"pause & resume\" but it is good enough.  Entering and exiting the debugger also sounds fine in normal language (the sense of go-into, come-out-of _works_ ), pedants might say the debugger doesn't _exit_  as such, but it's good enough.  Having one of those as an alias and the other as the canonical name is fine - I don't think there is a compelling case for changing the canonical name, so I'd have `Enter` as the alias.   Other possible verbs ..  `Start `tends to be something asynchronous, and might be mistaken for the command to debug a job/runspace etc, so the other 2 are better. `Invoke `tends to be \"do something I don't have a verb for\"  There is a `debug `verb - PowerShell cmdlets use it in the sense of \"attach a debugger to this running thing\", so I don't really like `Debug-Script`. \r\n\r\nDiscovery: I'd use `get-command *debug*` or `get-command *breakpoint*` so `wait-debugger` with an alias of `breakpoint `works for me: I can't think myself into the mind of someone taking their first steps with breakpoints and debuggers, but I think those are probably still the keywords you'd want a search to hit.\r\n",
