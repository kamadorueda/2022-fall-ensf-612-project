    "body": "> The breaking change could avoided by added a new parameter like AdditionalChildPath with ValueFromRemainingArguments = true.\n\nTrue.  The output from `Get-Command` / `Get-Help` would be a little bit more cluttered, but that's no big deal if there's concern about changing existing parameter types.  (There might also be weird situations where someone leaves ChildPath empty or null but passes values to AdditionalChildPaths.  What's the proper behavior there?  `root//additional/child/paths` or `root/additional/child/paths`?)\n\n>  ChildPath accepting ValueFromRemainingArguments can be confusing, e.g. Join-Path root d1,d2 would work like Join-Path root \"d1 d2\" \n\nNot sure I understand this one.  Did you mean `Join-Path \"d1\" \"d2\"`, or was the single string literal intended?  How is this different from any other parameter with `ValueFromRemainingArguments` enabled?\n\nPersonally, I like having `ValueFromRemainingArguments`.  I don't know if I'm in the minority on this, but `Join-Path` is one of the cmdlets that I always use with arguments passed by position rather than by name.  It would be more confusing to me to have to remember where to start including commas, instead of having a simpler call.  Assuming we leave `-ChildPath` alone and add a third parameter, the calls look like:\n\n``` posh\nJoin-Path one two three,four,five\n\n# versus\n\nJoin-Path one two three four five\n```\n\nI think the second syntax looks much nicer (and less error prone), but even if I had to go with the first option, it would still be useful.\n",

Also, `ChildPath` has `[AllowNull()]` but `Path` does not.  No idea why they are different, but I left that alone.  Only difference now is that you can have multiple `ChildPath` strings, and there are a few options for how to handle null / empty values in the middle of that array rather than at the end.\n\nI'm leaning toward ignoring empty values unless they're at the end of the list, in which case we'll go ahead and tack on a trailing separator to keep behavior consistent with today.\n",
