    "body": "If folks want to use 24-bit color with `Write-Host` then it seems that PowerShell and/or .NET Core would have to adapt.  Right now `System.ConsoleColor` is an enum defined as:\n\n```\n    [Serializable]\n    public enum ConsoleColor\n    {\n        Black = 0,\n        DarkBlue = 1,\n        DarkGreen = 2,\n        DarkCyan = 3,\n        DarkRed = 4,\n        DarkMagenta = 5,\n        DarkYellow = 6,\n        Gray = 7,\n        DarkGray = 8,\n        Blue = 9,\n        Green = 10,\n        Cyan = 11,\n        Red = 12,\n        Magenta = 13,\n        Yellow = 14,\n        White = 15\n    }\n```\n\nWhere the int values identify a index in the current 16-color palette for the console.  \n\nIn the blog post announcing 24-bit color support for the Windows Console, they mentioned they have not updated the Console property page to support 24-bit color yet.  It would be good to know what they have planned especially when it comes to surfacing this functionality through Win32 API and/or .NET Core.\n\nThat said, I could imagine new parameter sets on `Write-Host` with new parameters like `-Background` and `-Foreground` (or maybe `-Back/ForegroundTrueColor`) that are of type [System.Drawing.Color](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/93470c7590b38a509f0bcdd75ec2d7114da5f819/src/System.Drawing.Primitives/src/System/Drawing/Color.cs).  PowerShell already knows how to convert int values to that type:\n\n```\n97> [System.Drawing.Color]0xff0000\n\n\nR             : 255\nG             : 0\nB             : 0\nA             : 0\nIsKnownColor  : False\nIsEmpty       : False\nIsNamedColor  : False\nIsSystemColor : False\nName          : ff0000\n```\n\nAnd this type supports known color names:\n\n```\n98> [System.Drawing.Color]::AliceBlue\n\n\nR             : 240\nG             : 248\nB             : 255\nA             : 255\nIsKnownColor  : True\nIsEmpty       : False\nIsNamedColor  : True\nIsSystemColor : False\nName          : AliceBlue\n```\n\nIt has methods to return Hue, Saturation and Brightness.  Unfortunately, I don't see a ctor or static method to construct an object from those values.\n\nNow for coloring strings _not_ using Write-Host, then a class to help with the ANSI esc sequence would be very nice to have.  Not sure what exactly that would look like but we should take a peek to see what the folks in the node community (chalk, ansi-256-colors, ansi-escapes) have done.  I could see the community building modules to provide this functionality.  No need for integration into PowerShell Core AFAICT.\n",

We could also add the type adapters or constructors or `From___` methods etc. -- there are MIT licensed conversion routines on [Colourful](https://github.com/tompazourek/Colourful) (and also [ColorMine](https://github.com/THEjoezack/ColorMine)).\n\nWe also need an XtermConsoleColor table. We could use that _in place of_ the ConsoleColor since the first 16 of the Xterm color table are the same as the basic 16 ... \n\nHowever, the crucial part is a we also need to be able to map RGB values to the XtermConsoleColors, and even to the basic 16, because, you know ... not every terminal supports full color. I have to think about how to do that right. [Colourful has a few difference implementations](https://github.com/tompazourek/Colourful/tree/master/src/Colourful/Difference), but this would need to be fast...\n\nAnd yes, @rkeithhill, there is, in fact, no API or anything that allows using the new colors in the Console currently, _except_ VT ANSI escape sequences ... and that's really the only way I can see to implement it in format files anyway -- unless we extend them to support a color attribute all over the place.\n\nI'm ok with that. In fact I have already used them in file table formats the hard way, and that's how I implemented colors for [PowerLine](/Jaykul/PowerLine) obviously.\n",

That just creates another API that .NET and others would have to try and translate manually when they port to other platforms. Emitting VT sequences is the new standard for console features (and it has been for decades, Windows is finally on the train).\n\nIt's also notoriously tricky to determine what kind of actual color support a particular terminal provides. Most terminals set themselves as `TERM=xterm`, but then also support all the way to 24-bit color, while some applications like tmux only support 256color. I haven't found a good way to pick which of the sequences to go with, or determine what's possible, so I usually stick to just emitting xterm table sequences. \n\nThat's my 2 cents.\n",

I just put a static property in that you can set. My intention is to change the _default_ based on testing the OS, but allow you to change either the static property or an environment variable.\r\n\r\nWindows would default to 16 except on Windows 10: build 1607 (AU) 256color, build 1703 (CU) 24bit.\r\nLinux and OSX would probably default to 256 colors.  Not totally sure whether it's worth checking for an environment variable like `$Env:TERM` or just using a preference variable like `$PSColorDepth`.",

    "body": "> Given that the new `$PSStyle` in 7.2 supports generating VT sequences for RGB color representation, can we consider this feature request done?\r\n\r\nSure. It's not (in my opinion) a great implementation, still does not feel fully featured -- but since it's released, obviously the answer to how PowerShell will support color is:\r\n1. There is a built-in `$PSStyles` object with Foreground and Background properties that have nested `FromRgb` helper functions to generate full RGB ANSI escape sequences...\r\n2. The built-in `$PSStyles` object includes a few hashtables of arbitrary colors they can theme\r\n3. Users can figure out whether their terminal supports full RGB, 16 colors, or 256 colors and set `$PSStyle` colors appropriately as they wish in their profile on every load.\r\n\r\nIt could be **a lot** more usable. In particular, burying the support for `FromRgb` in properties of the $PSStyle object is obscure, and not supporting that syntax directly on `Write-Host` is disappointing, and I'm frustrated that you **broke all existing code** that changed colors on warnings/errors etc. #16441",
