Pretty painful to code and inefficient to run rather than just being able to apply culture format string as per PS5.1\r\n\r\nFeels like there should be a simpler way in Powershell that gets back to a one line solution as per Powershell 5.1. Is this not considered a bug if not a known documented departure from PS 5.1? Should I raise as a feature request if not considered as a bug?\r\n\r\n",
