    "body": "> The results of these hash operations are going to depend heavily on encoding -- a string in either bash or PowerShell will have an implicit encoding and the \"correct\" behaviour depends on what you assume that encoding to be\r\n\r\nThank you for the response, it being an encoding issue makes a ton of sense. However, after a bit more research it turned out to be powershell appending a new line to the piped string. I confirmed that the sha/md5 sums that I was computing were matched what powershell computed if I omitted the `-n` in echo when using a different shell.\r\n\r\nMy google-fu failed until I added encoding to my search and it looks like the exact same issue was discussed here.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/48371447/piping-text-to-an-external-program-appends-a-trailing-newline\r\n\r\nAlso there is an open issue here.\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1908\r\n\n\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48371447/piping-text-to-an-external-program-appends-a-trailing-newline\">We are Offline</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
