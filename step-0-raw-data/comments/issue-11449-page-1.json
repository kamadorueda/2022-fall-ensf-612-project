I tried PS5, PS6, cmd inside this new Windows Terminal and all showed color ✅However, when I run them individually (outside Win Terminal) they don't show color ❌\r\n\r\nIf all fails, I can just recommend my devs to use Windows Terminal. 🤷‍♂ Is that fair?\r\n\r\nWith so many Win clis, **what is the officially recommended cli for developers on Windows 10?**\r\n\r\n`<curiosity>`\r\n\r\n- Is there something preventing the Windows team from enabling that feature by default, after this experimental time?\r\n- I checked and Jansi is not enabling that feature (https://github.com/fusesource/jansi/issues/63), so they must do it some other way. I get it, they need to support Windows versions prior to 10.\r\n\r\n`</curiosity>`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
