    "body": "TLDR  **YES** to what @Jaykul  said.  There's a working standardized way already, a new way would only add novelty, is no more convenient and in some cases makes things worse. \r\n\r\nIn Detail:\r\n\r\n1.  Pagination using `| more` was set as the norm in the 1970s, it was incorporated in the first versions of MS-DOS and has carried through to the present day.  Better paginators have been created (e.g. `less`). Some commands will always want `| paginator` \r\n\r\n2.  Adding `  -Paged` to the end of command _does not save anything_ over typing `|more`.  To pre-empt \"Golf\" practitioners, where -`-p` is unique that can be used, but it won't always be valid, however  one can make `p` and alias for one's  preferred paginator and `|p ` _will_ always be valid\r\n\r\n3.  I can see some superficial attraction, to adding `-Paged` as a _common parameter_ handled _outside_ a cmdlet or function. We do it for error action, variables etc, so why not? Because it blurs a distinction that goes right back to the monad manifesto: **Output** and **Printing to the console** are not the same thing: it's a founding principle that _getting_ stuff, _processing_ stuff, and printing stuff nicely (for some arbitrary value of 'nice') are distinct activities.     \r\nThe reason there isn't and shouldn't be a pagination switch for  _getting_ or _processing_  commands is the same reason there aren't  `-List `or `-Table`  parameters : things to shift from outputting objects into the pipeline , towards printing strings on a terminal  (including marking up data for display in colour) should be in their own commands at the end of a pipeline or in the default formatting data used when the object has nowhere to go _but_ the console.     \r\n\r\n4. It's quite common for a command to evolve    \r\n`dir -Recurse  -Pat~\\Pictures\\ -include o*`   \r\nthen    \r\n`dir -Recurse  -Pa ~\\Pictures\\ -include o* | sort extension`  \r\nthen    \r\n`dir -Recurse  -Pa ~\\Pictures\\ -include o* | where length -gt 10mb | sort extension`   \r\nIgnoring page  breaking the short form of path, would this work correctly, or would he page switch be walked down the pipeline as it grows?        \r\n`dir -Recurse  -Page -Path ~\\Pictures\\ -include o* | sort extension`    \r\n\r\n\r\n",
