    "body": "REGISTER_MANIFEST is actually more self-explanatory for what this process actually does than LOG_TO_EVENTLOG. The instrumentation manifest is an ETW thing, **not** an Event Log thing, and \"register\" is the ETW terminology for passing off a set of data about your events to the system (register your provider with EventRegister(), register your manifest with wevtutil.exe, etc.).\r\n\r\nRegistering the manifest allows any ETW consumer to enable the provider by looking up the name and/or decode any events logged by this provider through the TDH APIs. It just so happens that the Event Log is an (not _the_) ETW consumer (in addition to its older logging APIs), and the service reflects your <channel> elements in the manifest into its own Event Log channels, but that's really just a side-effect of registering the manifest.",
