If there is no connection to the pull server, the agent will cache the status locally for every run. When a connection is reestablished, DSC will send all of the status messages that were cached locally. Once all status messages are successfully sent to the pull server, DSC will only send status after finishing a run.\r\n\r\nDoes this sound like your  scenario? \r\n\r\nMarkG",

    "body": "Hi Mark,\r\n\r\nYes, this sound like whats happens here. But then I have some questions about the scalability of the Pullserver or the possibilities to configure a DSC Pullserver for high availability.\r\n\r\nWe have about 180 VMs registerd to our Pullserver. When they have reporting enabled  I can see that the AppPool for the DSC Pullserver has very high CPU and RAM utilization. I additional there are a lot of error in  the event log from ESENT: \"The version store for this instance as reached its maximum size of 15MB...\"\r\n\r\nAs consequence the DSC Pull Server becomes almost unresponsive.\r\n\r\nSo is there a possibilty to load balance or scale out the DSC Pullserver so that the load can be distributed to multiply servers?\r\nAnd how can a DSC Pullserver made highly aviable (with WMF 5.1 and EDB database)?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJonas",
