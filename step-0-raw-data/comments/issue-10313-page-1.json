This value indicates no value whatsoever, not even $null. \r\n\r\nIf Out-Null generated a $null, then this sequence would create output:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$items | Out-Null | % { 42 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is because $null is a perfectly valid pipeline value and would continue down the pipe.\r\n\r\nOut-Null follows the idea of redirecting to /dev/null on Linux where no output is generated at all. A $null value is still a valid output value, however.\r\n\r\nEven knowing this, I do not think there is a way to examine that with a switch statement. A switch statement iterates it's input, and will process arrays one item at a time. AutomationNull indicates to PowerShell that no iteration is to occur -- not in the pipeline, nor a foreach statement, etc., So the switch behaves the same.",
