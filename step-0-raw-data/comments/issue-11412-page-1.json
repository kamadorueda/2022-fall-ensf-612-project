Put simply, given `$then = [datetime]::Now`, it would be good to be able to do:\r\n\r\n`$\"the time was {then:HH:mm:ss} on {then:yyyy-MM-dd} and the day was {then.DayOfWeek}\"` ($ is just an example character to denote that it's an interpolated string, it could be anything)` \r\n\r\nor even simpler\r\n\r\n`\"the time was {$then:HH:mm:ss} on {$then:yyyy-MM-dd} and the day was {$then.DayOfWeek}\"`\r\n\r\nrather than\r\n\r\n`\"the time was {0:HH:mm:ss} on {0:yyyy-MM-dd} and the day was $($then.DayOfWeek)\" -f $then`\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n`\"the time was {0:HH:mm:ss} on {0:yyyy-MM-dd} and the day was {1}\" -f $then, $then.DayOfWeek`\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely basic example and doesn't appear to offer much of a saving in terms of characters typed (in fact when referencing the same variable multiple times in the same string the numeric index method can easily use less characters in total), but you can already see that you have to mix up two different formatting/expansion methods in PS as it currently stands (or pass multiple objects to `-f` — and as pointed out, dealing with several items in the formatting list means that the index positions become crucial.\r\n\r\nAside from anything else, as soon as the list has more than a few items in it readability can be heavily compromised (to the point that I honestly don't know how Python and C# devs put up with not having interpolation for so long — it's still relatively new to both of them). It's the difference between reading a line once, from left to right, and flicking your eyes across it right to left and back as many times as there are references in the string (and potentially miscounting the variables in the list and introducing a bug as a result).\r\n\r\nThat said I'm aware that there's a desire to have Powershell not ape C# at every turn and become a pale imitation of a .NET programming language — it's a shell foremost, so if this kind of thing is overkill for a shell that makes sense to me. :)",
