    "body": "This is because PowerShell [automatically adds 'Out-Default -Transcript' to the end of pipeline](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/1f2dc26ab45d07ac0cd90b6a76af946d088d5243/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/hostifaces/LocalPipeline.cs#L325-L335) when it's transcribing and invoked via API. When [`-Transcript`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/1f2dc26ab45d07ac0cd90b6a76af946d088d5243/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/out-console/OutConsole.cs#L46-L53) is specified, objects passed through are transcribed but [are not passed ahead to the host](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/1f2dc26ab45d07ac0cd90b6a76af946d088d5243/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/out-console/ConsoleLineOutput.cs#L337-L343).\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell sub-kernel actually already adds `Out-Default` to pass output to host, however, [we have to use `Out-Default2` as the name](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive/blob/09d6307ddaea52ea39c41abfa980fd3dce9a25d6/src/Microsoft.DotNet.Interactive.PowerShell/PowerShellKernel.cs#L63-L68) due to a limitation in the native command processor. Since we are using `Out-Default2`, PowerShell believes it doesn't have the `Out-Default` command at the end, and thus adds `Out-Default -Transcript` automatically, which prevents sending anything to the host and hence you don't see output when the transcription is turned on.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be fixed in PowerShell code, [at here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/1f2dc26ab45d07ac0cd90b6a76af946d088d5243/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/hostifaces/LocalPipeline.cs#L313-L322), to not just check for the `Out-Default` name, but also check whether the `ImplementingType` is `typeof(OutDefaultCommand)`. I will open an issue in PowerShell repo and get it fixed there.",
