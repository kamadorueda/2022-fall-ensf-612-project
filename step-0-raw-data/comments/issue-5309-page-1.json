Installing it on one's workstation to get a feel for developing with it (hence the -includeide switch) and\r\n2. Installing it on regular servers (hence default behavior mimics download.sh)\r\n3. Using the install scripts offline (hence install-powershell.sh checks locally for sub-scripts).\r\n\r\nFYI: I didn't even learn it was used to install for CI testing until much later.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking that there was probably many who took a direct dependency on download.sh to get rid of all the hassles of figuring out their platform specific install procedure and then keeping up to date.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't think this project should feel a contractual obligation to not break that, I also feel that managing it with the sensitivity that people probably do take a dependency on it helps fuel adoption.\r\n\r\nSo rather than retire it because it seems redundant, I would advise changing its contents to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/tools/install-powershell.sh)\r\n```",
