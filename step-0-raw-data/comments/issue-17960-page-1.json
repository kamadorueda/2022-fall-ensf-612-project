    "body": "Maybe a more real life example would be clearer. In my script, I want to be able to override the default settings by setting an environment variable, as is common on Linux. Use of what is essentially a global may not be great, but in case of scripts it is usually the easiest way to go.\r\n\r\nCurrently I have written the following:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n$RetryCount = (Test-Path 'env:RETRY_COUNT') ? $env:RETRY_COUNT : 3\r\n$RetryTimeout = (Test-Path 'env:RETRY_TIMEOUT') ? $env:RETRY_TIMEOUT : 5000\r\n./run_tests.py -- repeat $RetryCount --timeout $RetryTimeout\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's quite readable, as long as you know that `Test-Path` can be used for variables, but requires typing the environment variable name twice. With my proposal, this can nicely fit on a single line while being even more clear:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n./run_tests.py -- repeat (Get-Item 'env:RETRY_COUNT' -Default 3) --timeout (Get-Item 'env:RETRY_TIMEOUT' -Default 5000)\r\n```",
