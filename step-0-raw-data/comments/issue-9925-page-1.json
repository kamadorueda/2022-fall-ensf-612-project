    "body": "@SuperBenji99 I don't know if this solution will work for you, because this solution is contingent on (a) being able to edit the sshd_config file for your server, and (b) having PowerShell installed on that server. Nevertheless, to solve this problem you will need to add the following line to your sshd_config file, then restart sshd on the target server:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSubsystem powershell /usr/local/share/powershell/pwsh -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace `/usr/local/share/powershell/pwsh` with the full path to the `pwsh` binary on the target system. Once this is done, PowerShell should support remoting into a target Linux or macOS system over SSH, just as it does with Windows hosts. Hope this helps!",
