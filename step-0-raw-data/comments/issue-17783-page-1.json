I believe this was already fixed in the 2.2 version of PSReadLine by https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/pull/2632.\r\n\r\nThe v7.2.5 of PowerShell ships the v2.1.0 PSReadLine which doesn't have that fix. Please upgrade to [v2.2.6](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSReadLine/2.2.6) of PSReadLine. See https://github.com/PowerShell/psreadline#upgrading for instructions if you are not familiar with upgrading PSReadLine.",
