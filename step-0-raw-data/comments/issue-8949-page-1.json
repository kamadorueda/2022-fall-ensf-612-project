    "body": "PowerShellGet is a bad example to use but if you had pinned versions in the PSD1 you could get round this with some not great coding like this \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module PowerShellGet -RequiredVersion 1.0.0.1 -prefix oldPSGet\r\nImport-Module PowerShellGet\r\nInstall-oldPSGetModule \r\nInstall-Module\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem would be then the 1.0.0.1 would be calling the latest version of PackageManagement not the one required by that version, which affects many other modules as well.\r\n\r\nHaving this built in with a simpler syntax like `<moduleName>:<moduleVersion>\\<CommandName>` would help in defensive coding strategies where you really want to be explicit of what you are running but would allow for side by side module version use especially thinking Major Version module changes.",
