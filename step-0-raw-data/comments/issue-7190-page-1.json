If I discovered I could pass a Path to `cd` without quotes, then I would think it would be ok to do that with other cmdlets that take a Path parameter. For that matter, why not be able to do it with passing arguments to executables or when using `Start-Process`.\r\n\r\nMastering of quotes is so crucial to those other functions that I think adding a special case just makes things more confusing.\r\n\r\n",
