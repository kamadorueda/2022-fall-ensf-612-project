    "body": "Reopen: not resolved, agreed that fix is necessary.\r\n\r\n> Feel free to open a separate issue about improving this user experience.\r\n\r\n@daxian-dbw This is the same issue, I was just wondering why explicit culture behaves differently.\r\n\r\nI have root-caused the issue, it looks like it it was designed this way, but in my opinion implemented incorrectly. When using implicit culture, it defaults to `Get-UICulture`, but with fallbacks as recursive parents. Parent of `en-GB` is `en`, so it returns `[ \"en-GB\", \"en\" ]`. Then when `HelpCultureNotSupported` is thrown in the implicit culture case, the exception is silenced to try and use fallbacks. Problem is that this silencing does not check if there are any more fallbacks, so if neither `en-GB` nor `en` can find help, command fails silently.\r\n\r\nI propose a fix to store the first exception of this type, then throw it at the end of the function if none of the languages succeeded. It is easiest, and provides the same descriptive error as when using explicit culture with no help. \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// UpdateableHelpCommandBase.cs:511\r\n// `_language` holds `UICulture` because option used to be called `-Language`\r\n// `GetCurrentUICulture()` returns `[ \"en-GB\", \"en\" ]`\r\nvar cultures = _language ?? _helpSystem.GetCurrentUICulture();\r\n\r\n// UpdateableHelpCommandBase.cs:550\r\ncatch (UpdatableHelpSystemException e)\r\n{\r\n    if (e.FullyQualifiedErrorId == \"HelpCultureNotSupported\")\r\n    {\r\n        installed = false;\r\n\r\n        if (_language != null)  // DKASZEWS: true for implicit culture\r\n        {\r\n            // Display the error message only if we are not using the fallback chain\r\n            ProcessException(module.ModuleName, culture, e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        ProcessException(module.ModuleName, culture, e);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// UpdateableHelpCommandBase.cs:584\r\n// If -Language is not specified, we only install\r\n// one culture from the fallback chain\r\nif (_language == null && installed)\r\n{\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```",
