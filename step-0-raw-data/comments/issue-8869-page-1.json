It is kinda hard to translate but the closest would be: pushologic adapdet - meaning when someone pushes problem away from himself most likely pointing someone  else responsible.

    "body": "I certainly could. Probably it would be fun to work on such a big OS project given I would get few pointers, how to start and etc. But I want to picture you my perspective first. \r\n\r\nI did not spend much time using PS and most of it is on Ubuntu lately, but still I observed few strange behaviors:\r\n \r\n1. PS sometimes shows garbage instead of usual welcome string (current dir and '>'). I think it is connected to not clearing screen correctly after terminating some long running job. You can still work as usual, it do not brake anything, but it does looks strange.\r\n2. Searching through history and reusing some command by clearing some of it often causes strange changes in colors of already printed characters - most notably removing some command entirely can cause to '>' char at the end of welcome string to i.e. became red. It also do not brake shell but also looks strange.\r\n3. Pasting larger chunks of text looks funny because it pastes char by char instead of all of it at once so you paste it and wait till PS will be done with it thinking how and why it is implemented like this. \r\n4. Keys issue, that you are surely already familiar with.\r\n\r\nSo PS is a shell and what shell does is basically printing text on screen and reading keyboard. And from my own experience PS is shitty with both for now. Having that in mind why would I invest my own spare time in this project? It is bad with it is most basic functionality. \r\n\r\nWould you i.e. bought a car that does not start like a 10% percent of the time? Or does not turn right? If this would be some other linux shell I would probably, just uninstall it and forgot about it right away. But it is from Microsoft so you do expect something more right? Certainly it is not some OS project maintained by 1 guy in a basement? Such big company have money and resources to do it better, right? Well for now it do not looks like it. \r\n\r\nYou say that this discussion is counterproductive. For me it is not counterproductive but it was escalated to the topic how maintainers threats users and other people that want or might be able to help. Should not maintainers want project to succeed? I think they should. Does closing such obvious issue drives you toward such a goal? I do not think so. Then why you did it? Why I should fix it if looks like you (well not you specifically but all people involved in this project) does not care really?\r\n\r\nIn commercial projects I worked on, usually this works like this:\r\nUser or business reports an issue.\r\n\r\n1. User or business reports an issue.\r\n2. You check this out and it turns out that it is caused by some external library. \r\n3. You look for help on their support page, bug reporting software etc for possible solutions workaround.\r\n4. You inform your users that problem was escalated and you are waiting for third party.\r\n\r\nDoing otherwise would looks like I am hard to work with and ultimately could cause me being fired if it would occur often or issue would be really major for the users and I would refuse to help them.\r\n\r\nSometimes when I am looking for some tool and it is open source I skim through source code and issues to see if it is maintained and how open, helpful and active is community. IMHO PS is maintained actively but it is not open nor helpful. \r\n**This do not inspire confidence.** \r\n\r\nIn readme it states:\r\n\r\n> Welcome to the PowerShell GitHub Community! PowerShell Core is a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, and macOS). \r\n\r\nFor now it do not looks like it is cross-platform. If you are asking me for contribution I am asking what is real priority of this project. It do not looks like Linux support is most important. There was recently 7.0 release. Seventh version of PS and it still can't handle basic navigation keys. \r\n\r\nI would certainly switch to PS as my default shell on Ubuntu since IMHO bash is bad for scripting, but PS is painful to use, so I am sticking to bash as shell and PS for some more advanced scripting (so I do not have to use it directly). \r\n\r\nHaving that in mind why would I contribute? After all from this issue users are left with impression 'if you have an issue with our project, well... you are alone with that. Good luck fixing it yourself'. \r\n\r\nDo this post is counterproductive? I may certainly look like this for you, but in my opinion this is me contributing. \r\n\r\n**Please change your approach to users, change way how you support this project. \r\nPlease re prioritize.\r\nPlease be more helpful and supportive.**\r\n\r\nThen maybe people like me will be more likely to contribute to the project.\r\nFor now reason says: **do not.**",

    "body": "Bare with me, this has a point.\r\n\r\nI use windows 10 as my daily driver and have used windows as my desktop OS of choice since windows 95. I am a Microsoft fanboy through and through. I've been a developer using Microsoft technologies since the late 90s but have avoided Powershell because it's way too verbose for my liking. A coworker of mine turned me on to it again recently an I have fell in love with the power of the object oriented-ness (is that a word?). I am now a new fan of PowerShell and once you have a hammer everything looks like a nail, am-I-right? I knew Powershell has been cross-platform for a while now so I thought I'd try it out on some of our linux machines to automate some backup processes and it seemed to be working swell. \r\n\r\nHot damn! I thought to myself this is great, one shell many OSes. Let's checkout the command line shell on Linux and maybe I can go with PS 100%. My glee turned to horror as I discovered that almost nothing works the same from the command-line as what it does in windows. An example is that auto-completion is very buggy with character casing and it doesn't cycle though the entries like it does on windows. PS continues to show all 148 (or whatever) entries as a giant block of text just like bash. \"YUCK!\" I say to myself upon this discovery, but it's easy to live with. Okay let's try something else. \r\n\r\n```\r\nit@server:~$ sudo pwsh\r\nPowerShell 7.1.0\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.\r\n\r\nhttps://aka.ms/powershell\r\nType 'help' to get help.\r\n\r\nPS /home/it>\r\n```\r\nUm... what user am I again? The default prompt doesn't include the username on linux where the user means everything. This is a windows-ism that _shouldn't_ have been the default in linux. But I think that is changeable, let's move on. As I was exploring I discovered many of the keyboard shortcuts that I use in bash on linux and in powershell on windows **DO NOT** work for powershell in linux. This is a show stopper for me and it completely decimates my productivity. This has to be a config issue on my machine right?\r\n\r\nWrong.\r\n\r\nWhen I discover a trail of issues going back about 2.5 years (at this point) that were closed for technicalities or because of the \"it's not my problem\" syndrome, _I was crushed_. How could a company that says it's product is cross-platform let something like this slip for over 2 years?  The responses from the Microsoft team members among this trail of issues has left me dejected.\r\n\r\nIt's issues like this one that really show me how (un)dedicated Microsoft is to cross platform technologies. This ongoing behavior I see from the Powershell team has really made me question whether a future issue that affects my powershell scripts on linux may go unfixed for over 2 years. I cannot justify this with my management. It's my decision to make, but if it breaks, it's my problem to fix and I cannot trust you Microsoft.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Thank you for your snarky elitist comment.\r\n\r\nI was telling a story of my journey of how PS command line for linux isn't perfect and I'm willing to overlook almost all of those issues. But as a product that claims to be cross-platform, it misses the boat on basic core usability.  This is a show-stopper for me and clearly many other people who have commented on these series of issues that keep getting closed.\r\n\r\nI love MS products and have made a career out of using them. I have invested a lot of my time the past couple months in learning powershell for nothing. This issue is STILL an issue 2.5 years later. The point is that I cannot trust Microsoft to be good stewards of cross-platform technology when they let something this basic go unfixed for so long.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to have a serious conversation about Microsoft's choices here I'm game, but leave the condescending comments at the door.",

That was one of those imperfections that all software has and that I _wasn't_ concerned about it. It was just a data point in my journey of Powershell discovery that I was trying to share. I was trying to share my experience and how excited I was about the prospect of having one shell and one scripting language across OSes. And how that excitement turned to disappointment over missing basic functionality.  As as customer, _frankly_, I don't care who's team is responsible. Microsoft is my software vendor and my company pays them a _lot_ of money. \r\n\r\nIf a member of our support team told our customer \"sorry, that's not my problem\" and hung up on them. We would probably lose that customer. I am trying to let Microsoft know that is how I was made to feel here by reading these issues and seeing them dismissed out of hand.\r\n\r\nI am trying to standardize the languages that my company uses to manage our infrastructure. Microsoft says their \"command-line shell\" product is \"cross-platform\" but fails to pass some minimum requirements due to a bug. In all due respect, I cannot recommend ANY product, no matter the vendor, if what we consider basic functionality to be non-existent or buggy. I truly have honest concerns about using cross-platform powershell. This issue is over 2 years old and has been passed off to another team at Microsoft and that [issue](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/802) that is over FOUR years old!  If I run into a bug in my critical infrastructure that is deemed to be \"some other team's\" fault. Am I going to have to wait two years for a fix?\r\n\r\n",

This is very disappointing and frustrating. \"It's PSReadline!\", \"No, it's PowerShell!\", \"No it's .NET!\".\r\n\r\nTo be completely honest I'm still _not convinced_ that it's .net because as far as I can see the .net bit works as long as it's not called from PowerShell.

In this case (as far as i can tell) Powershell team and .NET team are playing \"pass the buck\" on each other.\r\n\r\n> PS on Linux is just broken and looks line maintainers want it to work this way.

You can use Get-Module to check if you are unsure.\r\n\r\nTo find the profile.ps1 file, you can use the $PROFILE variable or check the docs [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-7.2).\r\n\r\nSee also the docs on [Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/set-psreadlinekeyhandler?view=powershell-7.2) and [PSConsoleReadLine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.powershell.psconsolereadline?view=powershellsdk-1.1.0). The customization options seem extensive; it's pretty neat.\r\n\r\nThat PSReadLine doesn't offer this behavior by default appears to be intentional, see PowerShell/PSReadLine#668.\r\nInstead (as @yodasad noted) there are Ctrl+a and Ctrl+e for beginning / end of line, as well as alt-b and alt-f for backward word / forward word. Those are Emacs conventions, apparently, but that's where I'm out of my depth.",
