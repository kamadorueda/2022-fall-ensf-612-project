The package depends on libssl1.0.0 while on 19.10 you have libssl1.1. \r\n\r\nYou can force-install the package and then install the necessary dependencies with the versions available on 19.10 and it works, but nevertheless it errors out when you try to go down the usual road.\r\n\r\nAlso powershell is not part of the microsoft repository for 19.10, so there's no apt-get install powershell.\r\n\r\nKR,\r\n\r\nG.\r\n",
