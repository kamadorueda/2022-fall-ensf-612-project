Since it's already shipped we won't be changing them so they are here to stay.  We can still introduce an `interop` namespace, but that would be additive and not replacing these variables.\r\n\r\nI would agree there is utility in having $IsUnix",

The first of which @RichardSiddaway has already covered regarding `!$IsWindows`. \r\n\r\nThe second issue I take is with using `Unix` on `Linux` and `macOS`:\r\n\r\nFirst, the usage is contentious to the point of being inflammatory in some circles. While it is true, there is some  shared heritage, it is also very true that Linus is not Unix. \r\n\r\nSecond, in my years where I worked very heavily with various *nix distributions, BSD clones, and Solaris, The term `Unix` was used to distinguish more UNIX-like operating systems from Linux distributions. There are certain assumptions about locations, APIs, binaries, and devices that come with Unix-like operating systems that are not applicable to Linux distributions. Using Unix to include Linux could be confusing should we ever need to make the distinction between Linux-like and Unix-like.\r\n\r\nMy final issue is that, outside of distinguishing these systems from Windows, I don't see any utility in uniting them under a common banner. Not-Windows is what you want. The ecosystems between macOS and Linux are distinct enough to make `$IsUnix` practically useless, IMO. Yes, some people do quite a bit of work to make their macOS more like Linux distributions, but out of the box they are are more distinct. The same can be said about the `$IsLinux` and the distinctive ecosystems within distribution and clone silos. However, `$IsLinux` does serve as a Not-Windows-or-macOS pretty well.\r\n\r\nKnowing something is Not-Windows is helpful so you can make assumptions like WMI will be unavailable. But uniting Not-Windows them under the banner of Unix seems superfluous and inaccurate. ",

POSIX is a family of standards created by the IEEE based on the various Unix variants. Linux is considered \"mostly\" POSIX-compliant, and with the LSB, will likely be completely so.  More significantly, UNIX is a brand for specific operating systems whereas POSIX is a ABI specification. Saying `$IsUNIX` is claiming that the OS **is** UNIX which is likely false and in violation of the Open Group trademark.  `$IsPosix` simply says the the platform supports some portion of the POSIX ABI.\r\n\r\n> Factually, only macOS is a POSIX-certified platform.\r\n\r\nThat is factually incorrect. Windows, through the POSIX subsystem, is certified as POSIX-compliant,  as are a large number of operating systems. (A lot of vendors did this work in the late 90's to comply with FIPS 151-1).

    "body": "@dragonwolf83:\r\n\r\nTo answer the rhetorical question first:\r\n\r\n> What about Cygwin and WSL? Is it factually correct to call either one of them Unix or Linux?\r\n\r\nYes to \"Unix\" in the sense of \"Unix-like\" (we needn't worry about \"Linux\" in the context of this discussion, but as an aside: WSL self-identifies as Linux (`uname`)), though you'd want to make clear that they're emulation environments with limitations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Cygwin it is a moot point, however, because you cannot install PowerShell Core in it (as far as I'm aware; you can start the _Windows_ PowerShell Core executable, but then you're simply running on _Windows_)\r\n\r\nWith respect to WSL: I don't know if it's officially supported, but running PowerShell Core  on WSL seems to work fine, at least the Ubuntu flavor.\r\n\r\n> There is no grouping.\r\n\r\n\"Unix\" _is_ a grouping. No one should expect it to refer to a specific OS these days.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI agree that we don't have to be accurate - in fact, we cannot be.\r\n\r\nBecause `$IsPosix` references an actual standard - trademarked as POSIX® - my concern was that it suggests an unwarranted accuracy (unlike `$IsUnix`).\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps, as with the \"Unix\" / \"UNIX®\" distinction, there's also informal use of \"Posix\".\r\n\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, POSIX® is a _family_ of standards, and _selective_ certification is possible.\r\nThere is no _the_ POSIX® standard, but there are parts that matter in the context of PowerShell.\r\n(I'll cover that in a separate comment.)\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, if everyone's happy with `$IsPosix` and understands it to mean quasi-POSIX® rather than certified compliance, that's fine.\r\n\r\nWithout the compliance confusion, I agree that it's helpful to reference POSIX as a de-facto near-common denominator (even though that is quite fuzzy in itself, without naming parts or versions).\r\n \r\n",

POSIX.1-2017 aka IEEE Std 1003.1™-2017 aka The Open Group Technical Standard Base Specifications, Issue 7 is composed of 4 volumes, the following 2 of which are the non-real-time POSIX standards (1003.1) required for POSIX® certification, albeit in a _more recent_ edition:\r\n    * [XSH: System Interfaces: IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 (Revision of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008)](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/contents.html) (APIs, system functions)\r\n    * [XCU: Shell & Utilities: IEEE Std 1003.1-2017 (Revision of IEEE Std 1003.1-2008)](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/contents.html)\r\n    * The other 2 volumes are:\r\n         * [XBD: Base Definitions](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/basedefs/contents.html) (sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 of which the non-real-time POSIX® certifications also require compliance with) \r\n        * [XRAT: Rationale](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/contents.html)\r\n       \r\n  * Currently, **3 UNIX® certifications exist, depending on the (historical) version of the SUS: UNIX 03, UNIX 98, UNIX 95** - see https://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/, which also lists all currently certified operating systems.\r\n\r\nThe perhaps surprising thing is that while UNIX® certification _encompasses_ compliance with a specific POSIX _standard_, it is distinct from POSIX® _certification_ (with the latter seemingly of little real-world importance, given how few products are currently certified).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> Open Group certifies operating systems as UNIX not POSIX\r\n\r\nAs stated above, the Open Group does _both_ (in the case of POSIX jointly with IEEE).\r\n\r\n> POSIX is a ABI specification. \r\n\r\nThe current POSIX standards _include_  - but aren't limited to - an A*P*I specification, not an A*B*I specification - compatibility is only required at the _source-code_ level, not at the _binary_ level.\r\n\r\n> Windows, through the POSIX subsystem, is certified as POSIX-compliant, as are a large number of operating systems.\r\n\r\nNo, Windows is _not_ currently POSIX-certified (and it's safe to assume won't ever be again).\r\n(Unix-like platforms aren't technically POSIX-certified: some went for UNIX-certification, which, however _implies_  POSIX compliance, as detailed above.)\r\n\r\nA brief history of POSIX on Windows:\r\n\r\n* Windows NT - Windows 2000: [_defunct_] [Microsoft POSIX subsystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_POSIX_subsystem): \"Windows NT versions 3.5, 3.51 and 4.0 were certified as compliant with FIPS 151-2.\",  a specific, [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards)-related POSIX standard that [has since been withdrawn](https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/15/withdrawn_fips_by_numerical_order_index.pdf).\r\n\r\n* Windows XP / Server 2003 - Windows 8/Windows Server 2012: \"The POSIX subsystem was replaced in Windows XP / Windows Server 2003 by [_defunct_] [\"Windows Services for UNIX\", (SFU)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Services_for_UNIX) [...] SFU was removed from later versions of Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012\" (ibid.)\r\n\r\n* Windows 10 / Server 2016 - now: \"SFU is logically (though not formally) replaced by the [Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update and Windows Server 2016 Version 1709 respectively.\" (ibid.)\r\n    * Note that **Microsoft conceives of WSL as  [\"primarily a tool for developers – especially web developers and those who work on or with open source projects\"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)**\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
