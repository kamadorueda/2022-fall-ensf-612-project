    "body": "This is perfectly doable. I do this to great effect in PSKoans. However, it has some caveats.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vexx32/PSKoans/blob/eac7d8250dfe49e85e12b7432ad687dcf5470f78/PSKoans/PSKoans.psm1#L16-L26\r\n\r\nYou'll notice I duplicate the definition _with_ and _without_ the `Attribute` name suffix, one inheriting from the other.\r\n\r\nI found that unlike in C# where you can _consistently_ drop the `Attribute` portion of a class name when actually using it as an attribute, you can't always do this in PS. I don't know why, but in some circumstances (e.g., class being available in _global_ scope) you can define a class called `KoanAttribute` and refer to it with `[Koan()]`. In others, you instead have to use the _actual_ name of the class. To get around this weirdness, I duplicate the class name with a short name and just use it to directly inherit the original class. Whichever it picks, I'll get it more or less correct. You have to be careful when examining attributes manually, if you ever need to do that, though.\r\n\r\nI also use this for my transform attributes in PSWordCloud:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vexx32/PSWordCloud/blob/55723befc757eae27fb20dfb7dd273360c150655/PSWordCloud/Public/New-WordCloud.ps1#L7-L58\r\n\r\nAnd its use adheres to the aforementioned restriction -- its _full_ name has to be used, not the short name lacking the `Attribute` suffix on the name in the definition.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/vexx32/PSWordCloud/blob/55723befc757eae27fb20dfb7dd273360c150655/PSWordCloud/Public/New-WordCloud.ps1#L307-L326\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT @lzybkr I'm not sure why this happens, but it's weirdly inconsistent. As I mentioned, if the type is made available in global scope (e.g., by including it as a `ScriptsToProcess` file in the module manifest), then the attribute can be referred to as `[SizeTransform()]` instead of `[SizeTransformAttribute()]`",
