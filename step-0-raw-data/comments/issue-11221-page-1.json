This provided an understanding of the process, style and key points. When you try to understand changes in a PR, it educates great. After that, you begin code review and commenting. You can spend it 5 minutes or an hour a day for your pleasure. Then you can try to prepare the environment and compile the project. But first you have to read documents in the repo. They can be outdated and you can update them in your first PRs to get experience with contributing process and git. This is my experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I believe `Select-Object` is in `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility` so you should be able to find it in that folder. _Most_ commands are named `VerbNounCommand` so I'd start looking for `SelectObjectCommand`, but there are some exceptions, so you might just want to search for `SelectObject` and see where that gets you. \r\n\r\nYou can sometimes find things searching the PS cmdlet name in full `Select-Object`, but that will typically only appear in documentation comments more than anything, so you might have trouble finding things using that.\r\n\r\nIf you're not used to C#, @iSazonov's suggestions will help a lot when it comes to getting familiar with it, but equally I'd say tinkering around with a cmdlet or two would also be a great way to get a feel for things.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOn the most recent aspect of this issue specifically, where Select-Object seems to be waiting until the end of the pipeline to send off output when using `-Unique`, I'd think you can remedy that by simply outputting each object in `ProcessRecord`. It'll most likely be adding each unique object to some cached collection that it uses to ensure each object is unique, so you can build off of that by just outputting objects as they're added to the collection. Once that's working, just remember to remove the output in `EndProcessing` that most likely occurs when using `-Unique`, so you don't duplicate the output.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/49609581/96590180-07d7-11ea-89b1-2f719dc4bb9c\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell\">PowerShell/PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>PowerShell for every system!

It cascades to several other documents, some of them I am already familiar with, others not. As stated, I need to do some more investigation before I can grab this PR and need to start with some easier ones, like [Rule for the use of the command: [ScriptBlock]::Create `#1454`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/1454.).\r\nMy goal is to eventually pick this one up, but it might take quiet a while, therefore I do not want prevent anybody else to do so if it get any urgency.",

    "body": "This is the closest issue I could find instead of opening a new one. Not only is `Select-Object` slower than it should be, but there is no documentation regarding the fact that the `Unique` switch is applied to output *AFTER* other parameters have been applied. Therefore if the input collection has more items than you're asking to be returned as output, the final number isn't guaranteed. To me this feels backward and the workaround of using two instances of `Select-Object` as shown below is inherently slow due to how it is implemented. See [PowerShell Select-Object: Using -Unique with First/Last/Skip/Index](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69577421/15243610) for additional details.\r\n\r\n**Recommendation:** Update documentation for how `Unique` interacts with `-First` / `-Last` / `-Skip` / `-Index` / `-SkipIndex` / `-SkipLast` parameters\r\n\r\n**If possible:** Change how `Select-Object` is implemented. I don't know exactly what this would look like, but using the pipeline is an advantage in my mind, yet whenever I'm working with large data sets I find myself avoiding the pipeline syntax in scripts. This is another example that I'll be using a workaround in a script instead of the pipeline\r\n\r\nAs an example of where documentation would be helpful, consider the following which I expected to return 3 unique items:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS > 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5 | Select-Object -Unique -First 3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n```\r\nA quick workaround is to use a second call to `Select-Object` to first get the `Unique` items and then select the `First` number. This approach is 1) Slow due to how `Select-Object` is implemented, and 2) undocumented as far as I can tell\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS > 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5 | Select-Object -Unique | Select-Object -First 3\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n```",

With this in mind - it is somewhat clunky to explicitly return `$_`, but you can use `ForEach-Object` and create your `HashSet` in the `-Begin` block. _However_, due to [issue #7930](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7930), you cannot free-up memory by removing the `HashSet` in an `-End` block.\r\n```pwsh\r\n#iRon7's example using case insensitive string comparisons\r\n$HashSet = [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]]::New([StringComparer]::InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)\r\nGet-ChildItem . -Recurse | Where-Object { $HashSet.Add($_.Name) }\r\n\r\n#Swapping Where-Object to ForEach-Object\r\nGet-ChildItem . -Recurse | ForEach-Object -Begin { $HashSet = [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]]::New([StringComparer]::InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) } -Process { If ($HashSet.Add($_.Name)) { $_ } }\r\n\r\n#Getting wild with a direct invocation to script blocks instead of ForEach-Object\r\nGet-ChildItem . -Recurse | . { begin { $HashSet = [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]]::New([StringComparer]::InvariantCultureIgnoreCase) } process { If ($HashSet.Add($_.Name)) { $_ } } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefinitely worth checking out [this blog](https://powershell.one/tricks/performance/pipeline) and [Issue #10982](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10982) on why the last example might be speedy.\r\n\r\nOverall, the contrived example using `Get-ChildItem` probably isn't the most realistic scenario - but `Select-Object` definitely has a few problems that have been noted:\r\n\r\n- `-Unique` is applied after other switches which means you might not get the total number of results you're expecting\r\n- `Select-Object`'s case sensitivity isn't consistent and the opposite of what you would expect (and get with `Sort-Object`)",

    "body": "In this weird example, using `&` might have been better, but in general dot-sourcing would be more akin to a translation of what `ForEach-Object` is doing. Since we don't care about the value of `$HashSet` and would eventually want to free up the memory there, the call operator would have made sense.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I recall the blog comparing dot-sourcing to the call operator, as they're different operations; but should be comparable in performance. The simple difference is easy to see with something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1..5 | . { begin { $FirstVal = $_ ; \"First Value was $($FirstVal)\" } process { \"Current number is: $($_)\" } } | Select-Object -First 2\r\n\r\n1..5 | & { begin { $FirstVal = $_ ; \"First Value was $($FirstVal)\" } process { \"Current number is: $($_)\" } } | Select-Object -First 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nGive each of those a whirl and check $FirstVal when you're done. For me, I'm often updating a variable (hashtable, custom object, anything really) within the `ForEach` loop structure and I need that variable beyond a pipeline one-liner, so dot-sourcing works well a lot of the time and is a more direct translation of what `ForEach-Object` is doing",
