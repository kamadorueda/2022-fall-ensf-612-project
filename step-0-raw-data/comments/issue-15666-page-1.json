    "body": ">  we should have something similar for pwsh\r\n\r\nWhy for? Who will be the consumer? Are there really so many that a special update channel is required?\r\nUsually you say that this should be a separate community project. :-)\r\n\r\n> What about LTS, stable, and preview channel support?\r\n\r\nIn general it doesn't matter. This is the concern of the update service.\r\n\r\n> Presumably, this is built into the Console host.\r\n\r\nLet's look how other applications do (on Windows):\r\n1. Need specific update service with installer elevated permissions and permissions to download new version.\r\n2. Need schedule tasks to trigger checks, notifications and install/update/upgrade\r\n3. Application it self trigger p.2.\r\n\r\nIf an application has not the elevated update service the update process will ask user to elevate.\r\n\r\n> Presumably, this is built into the Console host.\r\n\r\nI hope this doesn't happen in pwsh itself. There are already many means for updating applications. Now also winget. It is their task to implement the required update model.\r\n\r\nThis can most likely only be implemented on the basis of links and my main concern is that it is completely incompatible with WindowsUpdate.",

    "body": "Bash updates itself through a package manager.  You could have multiple terminal panes/tabs/windows using the same host and the other bash sessions will continue working while the updates continue. and either require sourcing bash or restarting the host. Pwsh could do similar but I'm presuming this request is to help users of WinGet more than users on other systems. Not sure this approach will work as well on Windows. I'd use Chocolately as example in this case as it updates choco as it's utilizing choco. ",
