    "body": "Agreed, @vexx32 - it's worth switching to a hyphen.\r\n\r\nThat said, the error message isn't part of _this_ repo, and it looks to me that the DSC code may not have been open-sourced (yet?), so the correct place to report this issue is https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell?category_id=148047\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n\r\n_Separately_, it's important to understand the true issue here, and the true issue is one of character encoding. A lack of awareness of that can cause other problems down the line.\r\n\r\n@Cryowatt: Whether it's documented or not, PowerShell _does_ support this substitution, as it does with other punctuation and quote characters, as @vexx32 mentions - see [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55053609/45375) for details.\r\n\r\n@BenJTucker: \r\nYour script will only work as long as it contains only characters in the ASCII range (7-bit, code points `0` through `127`), because both UTF-8 and ANSI encodings (the default in Windows PowerShell) share that range.\r\n\r\nWhile you may have no plans to use non-ASCII-range characters, know that saving your scripts as UTF-8 _without BOM_ will cause Windows PowerShell to misinterpret them as ANSI-encoded, once you add a non-ASCII-range character - and as you've experienced, that can happen through copy and paste.\r\n\r\nThe best cross-edition and cross-platform choice of encoding is UTF-8 _with BOM_.\r\nVS Code defaults to UTF-8 _without BOM_, which generally makes sense, but causes problems with Windows PowerShell (but not PowerShell _Core_).\r\n\r\nLack of API support has so far prevented the PowerShell extension for VS Code from defaulting new PowerShell files to UTF-8 _with BOM_ - see [this issue](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/1771), which also shows how you can _manually_ configure VS Code that way.\r\n\r\n",
