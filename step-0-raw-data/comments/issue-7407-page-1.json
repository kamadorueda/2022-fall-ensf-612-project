You're making changes to one of the core APIs for handling backticks and that is almost certainly going to break people in strange ways. I sympathize with what you're trying to do - I've never been terribly happy with our quote processing - but we have millions of people using PowerShell today and some significant portion of these users may be broken by these changes. Weighing the cost of breaking current users against the somewhat marginal value this PR brings leads me to recommend that we should not take this change.",
