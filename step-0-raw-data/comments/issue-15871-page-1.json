This only applies when the output is going to be processed by powershell either with:\r\n\r\n* redirection\r\n* saving to a var\r\n* being pipelined to something else\r\n\r\nWhen none of these apply then the stdout is written directly to the console buffer bypassing PowerShell. Unfortunately some of these concepts may not apply to Linux so take this with a grain of salt.",
