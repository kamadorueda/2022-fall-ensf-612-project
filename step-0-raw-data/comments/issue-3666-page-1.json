It may turn out to be related to path normalization, but I still think it should have it's own issue.\r\n\r\nThis one is about attempting to rename, remove or move an *existing* file. The error message in this case is `Cannot find path '1\\2' because it does not exist.` rather than `Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\temp\\1\\2'`.\r\n\r\nI think you'd be unlikely to run into this in Windows, at least on its native file systems, since both forward and backslashes are disallowed. In Unix forward slashes are allowed, and it's simple create, from bash or other programs, a file with forward slashed in the name.",

One problem is that I haven't found a way to definitively identify an NTFS file system under Linux.\r\n\r\nRegarding `[System.IO.Path]::GetInvalidPathChars()` and `[System.IO.Path]::GetInvalidFileNameChars()`, there appear to be separate implementations for each *platform* in coreclr.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the notion of illegal characters is largely platform-based rather than file system based. As an experiment, I created a file named `a>b<c:?|` on an NTFS volume on my Linux box with the `touch` command. There are five characters in there that Windows considers to be illegal, but the NTFS file system accepts them and Windows displays the file properly in Windows Explorer. I can't *do* anything with it on Windows, such open or delete it, but it is recognized.",

Furthermore, one of our primary goals right now is enabling more backwards compatibility with existing scripts and modules. \r\n\r\nWith both of those in my mind, **I think it's fair to rule out ever requiring Windows users to conform to Linux and use forward slashes**. \r\n\r\nOn a more positive note, I think that enabling escaping of backslashes (which we may have already done to some degree) is certainly a step in the right direction, even if it doesn't solve the pipelining issue. **Is there any reason someone sees *not* to do this?**",

    "body": "I'd start with design. We want magic features but every time fallback to platform specific implementation details.\r\nWhat is the main goal? I believe it is having portable scripts.\r\nAt the same time, we need to give users the ability to perform low-level operations (such as described in description of the issue).\r\nCurrently, path portability is achieved by means of aggressive normalization. It has several side effects and they _cannot be eliminated_ completely without adding complexity to the language or/and rules.\r\nI'd split file provider to two levels - high (portable) and low (platform specific). Then introduce [portable] path (PSSA will understand this!). Perhaps non-portable could be default in console or we could have a switch for the mode. Perhaps we could do agressive normalization while user types a path and force typing backstick to escape and stop the normalization. Perhaps we could have syntax sugar for [portablepath]/[non-portablepath] to enhance current Path/LiteralPath experience.",
