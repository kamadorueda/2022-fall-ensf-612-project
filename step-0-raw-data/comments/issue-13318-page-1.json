    "body": "> I feel confused to see support for a Microsoft product pointing to a third-party library. \n\nThis is the modern open-source world.\n\nNot only does the PowerShell team not have any business writing a Json schema implementation, but if we did it would take (a lot of) time away from working on PowerShell itself.\n\nInstead, people in the .NET community work hard to create and maintain libraries that we all get to reuse and can contribute back to freely. Rather than us insisting that only Microsoft can build good software, we participate in the ecosystem and in doing so de-fragment solutions to problems.\n\nDoes that mean there will be bugs? Sure, but there were bugs before too. Where once you might have filed a ticket that got internally bounced around into oblivion, this time support involves you communicating directly with the engineers who build the product, and if you don't like their response you still have the option of going to the original library to open an issue or even a PR.\n\nSo I understand your confusion, especially since PowerShell traditionally being a Windows product meant a certain form of product feedback. But now we're building PowerShell as a community out in the open, and that involves reuse, collaboration and pitching in.\n\n",
