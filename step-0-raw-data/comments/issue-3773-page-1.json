That's a serious breaking change.\r\n\r\nYour justification is just that you want it to be more like pipeline output.\r\n\r\nMy point is that making these common parameters more like pipeline output doesn't seem like a useful goal. They are not _like_ pipeline output -- they are output _parameters_. In fact, sometimes (when you use the +name syntax) they are actually _reference_ parameters. Additionally, _they exist within_ the pipeline. -- where they are more like streams than a finished output collection -- and changing them from the live stream type to something else at the end would just be confusing.",
