    "body": "Great! Now, we need to make the commits history better, so we keep a high-quality bar for the repo history.\n\nParticularly: \n- Currently there are 29 commits. It's unreasonable big number for PR that adds 7 new test files.\n- History contains your experiments to troubleshoot the failure on CI. That should not be included in the final history.\n- History contains two commits with a message \"fixing indentation\". At least, it's redundant to have two of them. I would question even having one of them, because it's probably better to incorporate in the previous commits, since this is a new code.\n- Commit messages don't follow [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#common-engineering-practices). Particularly in f4041463a9ceadb16043e02ba4eb9c87759120ce it's desirable to add more details to the commit message body about tests that are added.\n\nNow, there are two approaches we can take here:\n1. I can just squash all changes in the merge UI and we will have 1 commit for everything. It could be acceptable **in this particular** case.\n2. You can do an [intercative rebase](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase) to re-write history. It will also be very useful for your ongoing contributions because these git history questions will come again and again.\n\nPlease, review the [pull request lifecycle](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#lifecycle-of-a-pull-request) for more details.\n",
