    "body": "There is already a program called [NoSleep ](https://www.symantec.com/connect/downloads/readynosleepexe-prevents-screensaver-and-pc-locking)but I agree, this would be nice to have in PowerShell but it is also difficult because if there was a cmdlet then it would have to work on any OS. I think this should rather be a separate PowerShell cmdlet on the PSGallery. In general, PowerShell is moving into the direction of following an extension model containing only basic cmdlets and the rest being optional module extensions to it.",
