    "body": "Currently, hosting PowerShell in a custom ALC is not supported, because it tightly coupled with the default assembly load context in many places, for example, \r\n\r\n- module loading uses `Assembly.LoadFrom` which implicitly loads an assembly into the default assembly load context.\r\n- `Add-Type` also depends on `Assembly.LoadFrom`, as well as `AssemblyLoadContext.Default.LoadFromStream`.\r\n- PowerShell class also depends on default load context.\r\n- the helper resolver to load an assembly from GAC is registered with the default assembly load context.\r\n\r\nRegarding the `International` module used in this repro, its assembly resides in GAC, so the helper resolver is used and load the assembly into the default load context. That's why you see some PowerShell assemblies get loaded in the default load context.",

Are you saying that this is this an acceptable or recommended way for a library to load assemblies under .NET Core and .NET 5+? Or are you saying that fixing it would be too much work (or too potentially disruptive?)\r\n\r\nAs I understand, correct standard practice is to load assemblies into the same ALC as the requesting assembly:\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar myAlc = AssemblyLoadContext.GetLoadContext (typeof (<typeInMyAssembly>).Assembly);\r\nmyAlc.LoadFromAssemblyName(...)\r\n// or myAlc.LoadFromAssemblyPath(...) if you need to specify a path\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis mimics the behavior of how assemblies **implicitly** load in  .NET Core and .NET 5+.\r\n\r\nHard-coding to the default ALC saves a line of code, but is reliable only if the requesting assembly is also in the default ALC. Otherwise it introduces the possibility of the assembly loading into both the default ALC and requesting ALC. And that almost never ends well.",
