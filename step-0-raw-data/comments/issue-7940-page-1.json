    "body": "History notes: When I first implemented ranges, I'd planned to support a unary range operator e.g. `$a[1..]` but never got around to it (obviously).  For the upper bound, I'd been thinking about having a magic variable `$end` which would be equivalent to `$a.Length-1` so you could write `$a[1..$end]` to get everything but the first element.  And unfortunately we got the precedence \"wrong\" for computed endpoints (because we wanted to allow ranges to be concatenatable as in `$low .. $middle + $high .. $veryhigh`)  so I don't really see how we can avoid parens in things like `$a[1..($end-1)]` but it's still much nicer than `$a[1..($a.length-2)]`",

    "body": "> History notes: When I first implemented ranges, I'd planned to support a unary range operator e.g. `$a[1..]` but never got around to it (obviously). For the upper bound, I'd been thinking about having a magic variable `$end` which would be equivalent to `$a.Length-1` so you could write `$a[1..$end]` to get everything but the first element. And unfortunately we got the precedence \"wrong\" for computed endpoints (because we wanted to allow ranges to be concatenatable as in `$low .. $middle + $high .. $veryhigh`) so I don't really see how we can avoid parens in things like `$a[1..($end-1)]` but it's still much nicer than `$a[1..($a.length-2)]`\r\n\r\nI think if range `operator..` supported the optional `steps` (skipping n items) like Python's slice `operator:`, users can explicitly add a positive steps (such as +1) to tell the index `operator[]` to intercept and convert the negative range endpoint indices to positive indexing (by adding the array length) **BEFORE unrolling** the range**s** (concatenated or not). This way Powershell can keep the backward compatibility while adding a much needed _non-unit steps_ feature by offering something like `4..-1..+1` which translates to `4..($array.length-1)`.\r\n\r\nLooks like the index `operator[]` is above comma `operator,` and concatenation such as `operator+` according to this [document about operator precedence](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_operator_precedence?view=powershell-7.2). Does that mean that `operator[]` gets to see the range end-points in the (potentially compound) expressions inside it so it gets a chance to convert the indices to positive indices? If I misunderstood the precedence rules, could this be fixed through introducing a pre-processor stage replacing the negative index end-points with positive indexing (as appropriate based on supplied context) within the square brackets of the index `operator[]` before the interpreter's parser sees it?\r\n\r\nAnother way is to give users a shortcut referring to the array targeted by the indexing `operator[]` square brackets as it'll open up a lot more possibilities such as logical/boolean indexing (which is another way of doing filter/select element based on conditions like `$array[$_self -ge 5])` so we can do something like `$array[(1..6)+(4..($_self.count-1))]` when the $array can be unnamed, such as directly indexing into the output array of `(Get-ChildItem).Name`\r\n",
