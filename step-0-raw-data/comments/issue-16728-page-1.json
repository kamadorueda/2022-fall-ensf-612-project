However, you're talking about a .NET Core / .NET application being compatible with .NET Framework 4, which has been out of support for many years now (unless you mean 4.8, which I believe is the only version of 4.x still in support?). \r\n\r\n.NET Framework applications and libraries are by and large simply not compatible with newer .NET versions; that's not something PowerShell can do anything about. If you want to run something under Windows PowerShell you can do so, and if you're shipping a module you can specify in the manifest that it only supports specific PowerShell versions or platforms.\r\n\r\nIf the module manifest does not specify supporting the Core edition of PowerShell, pwsh will typically attempt to load the module in 'windows compatibility mode', where it will actually load the module in Windows PowerShell and communicate between the processes to allow you to use it. This isn't perfect, but it's the closest you'll get without just running Windows PowerShell.",

You need to ask the person whose code you're cutting and pasting if they have a version for .NET 6.\r\n> \r\n> Can't the PowerShell script be set to use .NET Framework version 4, or to launch older versions of PowerShell? If I update for .NET 6 it will break backwards compatibility, while @iSazonov just said \"Keeping compatibility is main priority\". This is a mess and not well designed.\r\n\r\nWindows PowerShell 5 is written and compiled for .NET Framework 4 \r\nPowerShell 7.2 is is written and compiled for .NET 6\r\n\r\nNo progress comes with absolute 100% guaranteed compatibility. People find old code on line that they don't understand, paste it into the current version and get upset that the two don't work together. 20 years after .NET was introduced I still hear people complaining that Microsoft should have stayed with VB6  (VB was only 7 years when the shift to .NET happened).  Shifting from earlier version of .NET to the current cross platform and open source version has caused some pain.  Progress isn't free, sadly. \r\n\r\n\r\n> Also the shortcut should be renamed, from `PowerShell 7 (x64).lnk` to `PowerShell Core 7 (x64).lnk`. Same for 32 bits version and other architectures.\r\n\r\n\r\nGo back and read the documents about why the word \"core\" was removed when 6 became 7. \r\n\r\n",
