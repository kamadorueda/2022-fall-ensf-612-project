    "body": "This version of PowerShell does not have the perf improvement for ForEach-Object -Parallel, and creates and destroys a runspace for each loop iteration (perf improvement in 7.1 preview reuses runspaces by default).\r\n\r\nBut I have tested both versions for leaks, and haven't found any.\r\n\r\nHowever, running scripts in parallel *does* use a lot of resources.  Try adding `[System.GC]::Collect()` to your loop to help ensure CLR recovers resources.\r\n\r\nI notice two things in your test repro above:\r\n  1. You store output from Get-ADUser, which may use a lot of resources depending on how large the returned objects are.  Instead you could just stream directly to For-EachObject -Parallel.\r\n\r\n  2. Your loop script writes to output/console, which is a serial operation.  So your repro expends a tremendous amount of resources to parallelize something that is immediately re-serialized, and essentially provides no benefit.",

    "body": "> In 7.1.4, I am noticing similar issues.  I have resorted to having each thread call [system.gc]::Collect() before the end of the parallel loop.  I am running between 25 and 100 threads each of which is loading modules and i get all kinds of weird effects.\n> \n> \n> \n> - Memory increasing and hours after the script has exited gracefully the process still has GBs of RAM that on some servers can threaten and has once made the server unable to reboot without an external hard reset.  The effect on memory seems to be different depending upon 7.1.4 running on 2019, 2012 R2 or windows 10.\n> \n> - Even with garbage collection being called in this manner, i still see memory increasing over the course of the 7 hours this script runs.\n> \n> \n> \n> But what's also alarming is that custom repositories go missing in threads sporadically.  IE in a batch of 50 threads, maybe 10 to 15 respond that the Repo is unavailable and when that happens, i am required to re-register the repo at the beginning of the script because the configuration keeps getting lost.\n> \n> \n> \n> There is something fundamental in how threads are spawned in this manner that needs to be reviewed.\n\n@Kettoch ive seen sporadic issues loading custom repos as well, but I don't have anything on hand to easily reproduce this. I saw the issue when using a module I wrote to do massively parallel ps-remoting. After being steeped in loooots of pwsh over the past few years, I think it has its purpose, but parallelization and remoting on a grand scale are just a bit too finicky for my taste. I've been considering rewriting this tool by leveraging a golang-based server and agent that communicate via grpc. Golang is nice and it handles parallelization pretty gracefully. There are also some interesting projects out there that either exec pwsh or actually create a clr hosting environment for pwsh to run. For myself, I'm going to be leveraging these more performant languages in situations such as these, and gluing to pwsh where it makes sense to. ",
