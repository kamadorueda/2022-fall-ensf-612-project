Some of the previous discussions/ideas like subsystem, etc... have turned out to be significant efforts that also have higher risks in terms of regressions.  Our build script used to have a list of assemblies to crossgen while currently it's either compile to ReadyToRun for everything or nothing (fxdependent and forminimalsize pkgs).

Then make another package? Is it worth it? Wouldn't it be easier if this partner just repackaged the existing package and removed unnecessary dlls and even crossgen code from it?\r\n\r\nNotice, pwsh distributes about 430 dlls but only 69 dlls are loaded at (interactive) startup.
