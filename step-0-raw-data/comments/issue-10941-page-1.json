    "body": "Ok, it seems that there is still some filesystem virtualization happening with AppX even though the package requests `unvirtualizedResources`.  When I run `install-powershell.ps1 -daily` in the MSIX pwsh, it ran but also had issues with the newly installed pwsh at the end of the script.  I can see the folder and its contents.  If I use a regular pwsh window, that folder doesn't exist at all.  If I close and start a new MSIX pwsh, that folder doesn't exist anymore.",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT Just FYI that this issue is still present with version `7.1.0-preview.6` from the MS-Store.\r\n\r\nRelated to the MS-Store generally: Apparently it forcibly closes the process of the running app during update (which cannot be controlled either), which could be fatal in some cases where a script is mid execution and could leave a system in a corrupt state. Therefore, personally I will not consider using the Microsoft store any more due to that and I think the store description should have a warning about this risk because most people will not be aware. Please evaluate whether the MS-Store is actually suitable for RTM releases of PowerShell or only previews only due to that.",
