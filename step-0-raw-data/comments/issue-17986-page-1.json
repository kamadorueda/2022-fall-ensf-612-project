You can even do `Get-Item Registry::HKLM:\\Software` and it won't be able to find the path because that resolution doesn't happen.",

It's saying \"here's the 'provider path', don't try to resolve it like a 'PSPath'\".\r\n\r\nThis is similar to a call of a static method vs an instance method in C# where the instance method would be the resolution of a non-provider qualified path?\r\n\r\nYeah kinda. If you consider `PSDrive` to be sort of like a virtual dispatch table of paths.\r\n\r\n> Therefore what I did as a workaround (getting the PSDrive myself) is the intended behavior for a cmdlet provider?\r\n\r\nWell you're not dealing with a `PSPath`, you're dealing with a provider path. Even file system will have provider paths that don't resolve to a `PSDrive`, e.g. `Get-Item FileSystem::\\\\localhost\\c$\\Windows`\r\n\r\nAnd probably only `FileSystem` will actually have PSDrive names line up exactly with literal path elements. I would say that the intended behavior is not to assume that a given provider path has an associated `PSDrive`.\r\n\r\n",
