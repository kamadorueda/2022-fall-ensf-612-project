When there is only one object you get that actual object back rather than a single array of 1 object. If you get multiple matches you get multiple objects back which is encapsulated inside an array. To always ensure you have an array back, whether it be empty or a single entry, wrap your pipeline inside `@()`, e.g.\r\n\r\n```ps\r\n$obj = @(1..3 | Where-Object { $_ -eq 2 })\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy putting it inside the array subexpression it will ensure that the output is always an array. Even if you have multiple matches it will be those matches as array elements rather than an array in an array.",
