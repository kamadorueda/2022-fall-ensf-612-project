    "body": "Looked into this a bit.  I think you discovered an interesting issue / circumstance.  In PowerShell Core, the `[IO.Path]::GetTempFileName(); (, 'foo') * 1e6 > $f` command produces a UTF-8 file without a byte-order-marker (BOM).  Side note: This differs from Windows PowerShell which produces a UTF-16 with a BOM.  When processing UTF-8 data with no BOM, the Get-Content cannot detect the file encoding when the file is read in reverse.  As a result, it does a forward search which enumerates the whole file (albeit in different chunk sizes depending on ReadCount -- which might explain your performance differences).  Can you confirm that doing the following changes the behavior for you?\r\n\r\n```\r\n$f = [IO.Path]::GetTempFileName()\r\n(, 'foo') * 1e6 | Set-Content -Encoding utf8BOM -LiteralPath $f\r\n```",

    "body": "Intriguing, @NoMoreFood, thanks for the sleuthing - using a file _with a BOM_ indeed makes a big difference in the resulting performance (and even seems to make `-ReadCount 0` marginally faster than `-ReadCount $n`)\r\n\r\nI would never expect `Get-Content` to _detect_ encodings, however: if a BOM is present, the encoding is unambiguously specified; in the absence of a BOM, the _default_ encoding should be _assumed_ (UTF-8 in PS Core), so there is no good reason for this variation in behavior.\r\n",
