    "body": "Since `Import-CSV` already supports reading from multiple files, it seams reasonable to make this change.\r\n\r\nWhat's happening is that, in the `ImportCsvCommand` class, the `ProcessRecord` method calls `PathUtils.OpenStreamReader` which does both path expansion and opens the `StreamReader`.\r\n```\r\nStreamReader streamReader = PatthUtils.OpenStreamReader(this, path, this.Encoding, _isLiteralPath\r\n```\r\nObviously, since only a single stream reader can be returned, the call has to error out if wildcards expand to more than one path. The solution would be to process the paths in two passes. Pass one expands the wildcards and pass 2 does the actual processing (using `LiteralPath`). \r\n\r\nNote that this is specific to the `Import-Csv` cmdlet implementation, so I'm not sure we can make any general assumptions about the others. However @mklement0 If you do have the time/inclination/patience to check them out, that would be cool.\r\n\r\n",
