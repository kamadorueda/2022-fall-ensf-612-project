    "body": "There's another problem with using `-AsJob` as a common parameter.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 6.x and earlier, we have `-AsJob` as a parameter on some commands (most notably: `Invoke-Command`), and it returns a `PSRemotingJob` for the job that is being run in the background.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 7, we have `-AsJob` as a parameter on the new `ForEach-Object -parallel` parameter set, and it returns a `PSTaskJob`.\r\n\r\nWe also have `ThreadJob` as a third type for jobs that are launched using `Start-ThreadJob`.\r\n(Aside: I find it quite confusing that we have `ThreadJob` and `PSTaskJob` types -- do we need two types of jobs here or can we move forward with just one?)\r\n\r\nIf we were to try going the common parameter route, do we provide a common parameter for each type of job? Or have a default job type for `-AsJob` and another common parameter to define the job type to use?\r\n\r\nPlus, as @mklement0 pointed out, using common parameters here feels awkward. I'd rather we control invocation of commands using post-positional operators.\r\n\r\nFor those who are interested, I opened an RFC for this a while back when I felt this was missing and would add value to the PowerShell async story. You can read that proposal and add comments in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/205.",

    "body": "I actually came to this from .net's async methods (like DoSmth()/DoSmthAsync()). As I understand from above there is already a mechanism to invoke cmdlet asynchronously without creating extra scopes (which was my main concern) and we just discuss implementation. I'm good with either operator or switch, latter sounds more intuitive to me, but I agree this could be awkward to see it on every  cmdlet. Probably switch appearance could be indicated inside CmdletBinding attribute.\r\n\r\nBtw, what is a PSTaskJob? Thread job seem to create a decent overhead, unlike task that came from async methods. Wondering if PSTaskJob can improve this. Below are some dummy examples.\r\n\r\nThis eats/cloggs 100MB+  of memory on my machine (on average)\r\n```\r\n1..100 | foreach {Start-ThreadJob -ScriptBlock {sleep 1} }\r\n```\r\nThis takes 1-2 MB\r\n```\r\n1..100 | foreach {([System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping]::new()).SendPingAsync(\"www.example.com\") }\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "This is all a great discussion.  \r\n\r\nCmdlets aren't really designed to run asynchronously.  There are threading, data streaming, and state sharing issues.  Over the years PowerShell has added various ways to run script/commands asynchronously: PowerShell remoting, Start-Job, Workflows, asynchronous API.\r\n\r\nMore recently I have tried to make the async API easier to use through ThreadJobs and the new ForEach-Object -Parallel experimental feature.  This has been mostly successful but has also accentuated PowerShell's inherent limitations, in particular the large overhead required to run PowerShell scripts concurrently (see my blog post for more information: (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-foreach-object-parallel-feature/).\r\n\r\nI am a bit ambivalent about adding syntactical ways to automatically invoke cmdlets in parallel.  The feedback we have received from the new ForEach -Parallel experimental feature makes clear that it does not meet many users expectations.  The large overhead, often slower performance, and lack of awareness of basic threading safety makes ThreadJobs and ForEach -Parallel potentially dangerous to use, or at minimum a disappointment for some users (again see blog link above for more explanation).\r\n\r\nI would love to build something that 'just works'.  But unfortunately, due to inherent PowerShell design limitations, this is not possible and each existing concurrent model has its own benefits and side effects.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2018/09/Powershell_256.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/wp-content/uploads/sites/30/2019/02/Powershell_2561.png\" height=\"14\"> PowerShell</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-foreach-object-parallel-feature/\">PowerShell ForEach-Object Parallel Feature | PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>PowerShell ForEach-Object Parallel Feature\nPowerShell 7.0 Preview 3 is now available with a new ForEach-Object Parallel Experimental feature.

    "body": "Adding `-AsJob` to _commands that can natively support it_ is the right way to go. It is the existing idiom for running things asynchronously in PowerShell. And regardless of the underlying implementation, -AsJob should *always* return a `Job2` object. PowerShell jobs are **the** abstraction for asynchronous operations. As long as you return a `Job` object, the user can use the standard *-Job cmdlets to manipulate it. If you break this abstraction, then you'll end up rewriting these cmdlets for each type of asynchronous \"handle\". In the OP's example `Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Url -Method $Method -Headers $h -AsJob` would probably return a subclass of Job2 that wrapped a `Task`. Not a background job object, not a threadjob but still a job object that can be manipulated with standard patterns. ",
