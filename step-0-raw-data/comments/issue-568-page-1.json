    "body": "I should expand on why I emphasized _readline_. These are not Emacs bindings; they are \"Emacs-style readline\" bindings. What we choose to do for a specific binding is entirely up to our shell. I agree that we should make an effort to work \"as expected\" for a Bash or a Windows-PowerShell-with-PSReadLine user, but it is not necessarily high-priority. As it is, this very simple addition to our readline implementation causes it to act much closer to GNU Readline than it did previously. I added this because it was bugging me, @zach-folwick, and @vors in the last couple days, and did not take much time (at this point, less time than trying to get a sign-off on the code itself).\n\nAdding a \"kill buffer\" for `Ctrl-K` and pasting it with `Ctrl-Y` is certainly some low hanging fruit we can do, but it does not _need_ to be in this PR for sign-off. Same goes for restoring a command before executing `clear`. I welcome anyone to add these extended features at any point (and I might do so myself later), but I think a continued discussion about it here is not useful. (Incremental history search is probably more tricky, and ought to be approved before being worked on.)\n",

In fact, Zach and I have discussed this, and I was debating whether to jump in and do exactly what you did here, after you closed his work item.  As you noted, it's not hard to implement a few commands using existing functions, and it greatly helps users without doing a lot of work.\n\nBut to explain what I was saying, let's take example of Control-S...In your implementation, if I read it correctly, you have Control-S, and Control-N duplicate behavior of a Down-Arrow.  Control-N is good, but why Control-S as well?  Control-S is forward-search in Emacs.  Why confuse users?  We can do Control-S later.\n",
