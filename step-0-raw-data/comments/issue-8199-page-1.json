    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT with all due respect, may I ask to reconsider this decision? The `-Depth` parameter in `ConvertTo-Json` does not have the same behavior as the `-MaxDepth` I implemented here:\r\n\r\n`-Depth` in `ConvertTo-Json` will quietly suppress conversion after the depth level specified (2 by default), for example:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> ConvertTo-Json (ConvertFrom-Json '{\"1\":{\"2\":{\"3\":{\"4\":{\"5\":1}}}}}')\r\n{\r\n  \"1\": {\r\n    \"2\": {\r\n      \"3\": \"@{4=}\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`-MaxDepth` as implemented here strictly fails the conversion if the depth of the json exceeds the value, the same way `ConvertFrom-Json` currently fails if the depth is higher than 1024 **and** `ConvertTo-Json` currently fails if the depth is higher than 100. With this in mind, `-MaxDepth` could also be implemented for `ConvertTo-Json` and is not equivalent to its `-Depth` parameter.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I believe the current `-Depth` parameter of `ConvertTo-Json` is not intuitive and has caused a lot of confusion for users in the past (there are lots of threads about it on StackOverflow, for example). What json serializer do you expect to stop serializing at third depth level by default? This leads to the user having to know beforehand what depth his input has in order for conversion to work properly (an unrealistic thing to expect). I don't think we should model new parameters aligning with it.\r\n\r\nI also think putting `1024` as the default is a bad idea. This would make it so there is no way to say \"I don't want a maximum depth\" (which is the most common scenario). It would also lead to the same problem `ConvertTo-Json` currently has: we expect the user to know beforehand what is the depth of his input.\r\n\r\nI know it would be a breaking change to have no maximum be the new default, but is it really a common scenario that someone is relying on the default behavior failing with input of depth higher than 1024? I think handling higher depth with this new parameter is the perfect opportunity to change the default behavior to something more intuitive: the cmdlets should handle whatever is thrown at them, if the user expects the input to cause a DoS in their system (which I assume was the reason for this default max depth), then they should specify a maximum depth optionally.",

At the time of discussion, we were not aware of the limitation of \"maxdepth\" would fail the entire operation rather than serialize up to 1024.  This (to me) seems broken, but would be a breaking change.  In light of that information, it's worth discussing again the the committee to see if there should be two parameters (which would be confusing to the user) or accept a breaking change at the limit.\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful if you can provide examples where the current limit of 1024 is insufficient.",

I like the idea of another switch for no `-NoMaxDepth`, more elegant than another invalid value!\r\n\r\nI would like to implement an equivalent to `-MaxDepth` for `ConvertTo-Json` too, to allow users to change the current default 100 value. If we're naming this parameter `-Depth`, it would conflict with the current `ConvertTo-Json` parameter, unless the team decides to break its backwards compatibility and make it explicitly fail from now on. In my opinion this is the best option because the current behavior of that parameter is a pain for powershell users for the reasons I explained above but I understand the backward compatibility concerns.",

    "body": "There are 2 things: 1) The maximum depth you want to convert and 2) the behavior of that conversion. They **both** need to be configurable, IMO and just relying on a single param for both would be a pain. \r\n\r\nThere are a very large number of objects passed to `ConvertTo-Json` where only having a max depth that errors would make them impossible objects to convert. We _need_ the ability to squash. This includes object types that have parent child mappings. There would no way to convert those without squashing.\r\n\r\nConsider the Current behavior:\r\n\r\n| cmdlet | Max depth | Default Depth | Depth Configurable | Default Behavior | Behavior Configurable |\r\n|--------|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|\r\n| ConvertTo-Json | 100 | 2 | yes | Silently Squash | no |\r\n| ConvertFrom-Json | 1024 | 1024 | no | Error | no |\r\n\r\nI would ultimately like to see it as this:\r\n\r\n| cmdlet | Max depth | Default Depth | Depth Configurable | Default Behavior | Behavior Configurable |\r\n|--------|------------|----------------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|\r\n| ConvertTo-Json | Int32.MaxValue | 2 | yes | Error | yes |\r\n| ConvertFrom-Json | Int32.MaxValue | 1024 | yes | Error | yes |\r\n\r\nIdeally we would would want a `-Depth` param that sets the max depth and an `-Squash` ( or something). we still need default depths (2 for `ConvertTo-Json` and 1024 for `ConverFrom-Json`). it would be nice to add the ability to change the behavior of `ConvertTo-Json`, but that's a bit out of scope for this PR. It would also be nice to be able to squash with `ConvertFrom-Json` but that i also a bit out of scope for this PR (or maybe it is easier than I think?).\r\n\r\nBut, keeping in mind that we _could_ add parameters to control the behavior later, for this PR all we need is to add `-Depth` to `ConvertFrom-Json` with a default of 1024, of type Int, with a ValidateRange of 1 to Int32.MaxValue. I don't see a pressing need to change the behavior of `ConvertTo-Json` in the same PR, but if it was I would recommend changing the internal max depth from 100 to Int.MaxValue (Keeping Depth at a default of 2). That way we are safe from DoS by default, but let the user hold their fate in their own hands should they wish to try an absurdly deep object.\r\n\r\nA bit of flavor text: A JSON object over 1024 in depth is an outlier. Other than abused/broken APIs or contrived examples, I have rarely seen a legit JSON objet that is deeper than ~30. On the flip-side, infinitely deep objects are very commonly thrown at ConvertTo-Json. (Based on my experience, YMMV.)",

Correct?\r\n\r\nFor symmetry with how `-Depth` works in `Convert*To*-Json`, that would also requiring _truncating_ the deserialization at the specified (max.) depth, (typically) for deserializing object trees of lesser depth that only need to be deserialized to a given depth.\r\n\r\nIs that the plan too?\r\n\r\nIf so, we need to decide how to represent the truncated properties, which is where @iRon7's suggestion from #8381 can come in, namely to represent the truncated values with `…`, an ellipsis.\r\n\r\nE.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n'{\r\n  \"p0\": {\r\n    \"p1a\": 42,\r\n    \"p1b\": {\r\n      \"p2\": \"not of interest\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}' | ConvertFrom-Json -Depth 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nshould then create something like\r\n`[pscustomobject] @{ p0 = [pscustomobject] @{ p1a = 42; p1b = '…' }  }`\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Sorry, I wasn't aware of the colon convention 😅 I applied your suggestions through GitHub's integrated tool, but there seems to be error when running the tests without the colons! I get errors like:\r\n```\r\nConvertFrom-Json : The input object cannot be bound to any parameters for the command either because the command does not take pipeline input or the input and its properties do not match any of the parameters that take pipeline input.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not super familiar as to why removing colons would cause this, could you point me into the right direction? Thanks!",
