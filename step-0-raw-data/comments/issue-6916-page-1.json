You can now use Write-Host to emit output to the information stream, but the $InformationPreference preference variable and InformationAction common parameter do not affect Write-Host messages. \r\n\r\n(Ignore the fact that this is not the entirely accurate, because the `Ignore` value passed to `-InformationAction` _does_ affect `Write-Host` and is in effect equivalent to `6>$null`.)\r\n\r\nPresumably - and perhaps someone from the team can confirm - this slight repurposing of `Write-Host` since v5 was to compensate for frequent misuse of `Write-Host` by cmdlet/function authors, which resulted in callers being unable to capture or suppress its output.\r\n\r\nBy making `Write-Host` write to the information stream (number `6`) instead, it became possible to either suppress or capture its output. (Note that, as stated, `Out-Host` indeed still only and invariably prints to the host (and possibly transcript)).\r\n",
