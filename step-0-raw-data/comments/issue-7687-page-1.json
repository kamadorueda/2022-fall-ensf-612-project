This is why different distros have different versions of some common utilities and they don't necessarily always move to the latest version.  On the other hand, we do publish to the Snap store which shifts the maintenance of the packages back to the package owners instead of the distro owners.  This means that you can just run:\r\n\r\n> sudo snap install powershell --classic\r\n\r\nOn systems that have the Snap client by default.  Independent of that, we are more likely to succeed on getting PSCore6 in Azure Linux images by default.",

Ubuntu Server has a new installer \"Subiquity\" which has the \"live\" in the iso filename and is the default installer. The older installer is obtained through the \"alternative downloads\" and has a filename without \"live\".\r\n\r\nUbuntu Server 18.04 \"alternative download\" .iso worked. I was able to use the apt repo instructions and install the powershell-preview.\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-rc.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0-rc.1\r\nOS                             Linux 4.15.0-34-generic #37-Ubuntu SMP Mon Aug 27 15:21:48 UTC 2018\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Ubuntu Server 18.04 -live- still gives me the error but I can try that again.  The new installer has an interesting change where there is a \"powershell\" to select in the installer.\r\n\r\nIf I can recreate this problem I will create a new issue.  At first I thought it was related to the documentation but seems there could be something else.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
