I don't know where this distinction originated.)\r\n\r\nSo in terms of formal definitions it looks as inconsistence. Anyone who studies the language using its formal specification will meet difficulties.\r\n\r\nIt also seems it is a bad UX (I and @vors both drew attention to that). If the statements in line are always separated by a semicolon, then users will expect the same in this case.\r\nIt would be good to preserve consistence here. Otherwise, it is not clear why we can `f(){} g(){}` and cannot `$f=1 g(){}`.",
