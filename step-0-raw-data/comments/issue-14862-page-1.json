    "body": "With respect to the _amount_ of extra information shown, one way to reduce it is to apply _exception_ logic, that is to effectively issue an _abstract warning_ if the configuration is unusual, namely:\r\n\r\n* In a _stable_ version, if at least one experimental feature is _enabled_, say something like: \r\n  * `WARNING: At least one experimental feature is in enabled. Type 'help about_experimental_features' for help.`\r\n\r\n* In a _preview_ version, where all features are _enabled_ by default, warn if at least one experimental feature is _disabled_:\r\n  * `WARNING: At least one experimental feature is in disabled. Type 'help about_experimental_features' for help.`\r\n\r\nIn practice, I suspect such warnings would rarely show if we stopped sharing user-level configuration files across side-by-side versions and if we reversed the exclusion logic for preview versions. Currently, it is very easy to _unwittingly_ enable or disable experimental features - see #14891.",
