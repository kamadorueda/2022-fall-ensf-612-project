    "body": "Here's what's happening: Path parsing is handled by the underlying provider infrastructure since each provider can have its own notion of what constitutes a path. There are different types of providers including ones that don't support the notion of paths within their namespace. This is the case for the function, alias, env and variable providers. They are not NavigationProviders which means they don't support (nested) paths, just a flat list of names. As such, these providers don't implement the path parsing APIs. When Split-Path tries to split a \"path\" in these providers it gets a PSNotSupportedException and explicitly returns the empty string. The comment from the code is as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n                            // Since getting the parent path is not supported,\r\n                            // the provider must be a container, item, or drive\r\n                            // provider.  Since the paths for these types of\r\n                            // providers can't be split, asking for the parent\r\n                            // is asking for an empty string\r\n```\r\n",
