    "body": "We looked over this in the Engine working group today (8/5/2021). We're in agreement with @PaulHigin's assertion here; copying variables to additional scopes like this may have unintended side effects. Especially as the condition we're using is based around the command name, it may be possible possible to trigger the behaviour in cases that we aren't expecting by simply defining new functions matching those names.\r\n\r\nFrom the discussion in the linked issue and the code change here, it seems like a potentially more appropriate solution would be to either:\r\n\r\n- Give the tab completion code access to the previous scope in these specific cases, _or_\r\n- Ensure that the scope given to the ReadLine call is a child of the original, currently-executing scope.\r\n\r\nThis change seems somewhat heavy-handed, and there aren't any limits as to how much we're copying from one scope to another. It seems odd that the values are available when executing the prompt, but not during tab completion, which seems to point to there being other possible solutions that shouldn't require copying the variables across scopes. \r\n\r\nWe're also concerned about what might happen if this were to occur in a remote debugging session; would this work & serialise data? Break completely? Simply do nothing?\r\n\r\nIf there's a more direct solution available, it would be preferable to go that route instead.",
