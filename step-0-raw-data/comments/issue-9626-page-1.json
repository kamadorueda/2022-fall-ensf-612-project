Saying that it's like C# isn't helpful for people who aren't C# programmers (i.e. the bulk of PowerShell users). So I think adding a few lines of expository text and some examples would help convince people that this is a good idea. Just a thought...",

Since I'm still writing it, some of the variable names change, so I want to use the exact variable name when dumping out values.\r\n\r\nSomething like this would be handy for that output.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nWrite-Host \"$(nameof($someVariable)): $someVariable\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm just starting to learn to use `Get-Variable -Scope Local` as a workaround on the debugging side, but a `nameof` shorthand would allow for more output control and eliminate some of the noise that is also part of the full local scope.",
