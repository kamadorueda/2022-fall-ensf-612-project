You'd have to ask Rob - but he might be agreeable for such a prominent package.\r\n\r\nIncluding it also makes curation much easier for companies who curate public packages to internal ones and those doing builds that don't have access to the repo (they don't have to rebuild the package)\r\n\r\nFYI - when I include the binary installer, I still do the checksum so that users still get the satisfaction that the binaries are checking out correctly.\r\n\r\nYou would also have to ask about the approval process - since I have trusted packager status there is no human review - but if we add someone to the maintainers list and they submit, they might have to undergo a period of review or you could ask for that status, noting that it is CI automation building and uploading the package.",
