The former could have a `string` `Value` property, and the latter a `ExpressionAst` `Expression`  property.  That way the number of Ast nodes remain the same as they are today, just the structure of how they are represented would be easier to work with.\r\n\r\nIn the end I just don't want to have to do string parsing/manipulation in order to figure out what parts of the `Value` I need to join up with the evaluated Expressions as the parser already did this when it parsed the expression.\r\n",
