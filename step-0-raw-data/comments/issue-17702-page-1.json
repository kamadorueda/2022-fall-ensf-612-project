In other words, I don't think that the snippet you point out is the issue also knowing that all other lines (except for the last line) do correctly return an empty string (rather than `$Null`). As far as I can determine, the issue is that `ReadChar` throws an `InvalidOperationException` at the `EOF` which causes the very last value to be omitted rather than to be an empty string.",

We are focusing on the last column, but this should apply to every one:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n$Data = ConvertFrom-Csv @'\r\nId,Note,Name\r\n01,,John\r\n02,\r\n03,Just a note,Ryan\r\n04,,Luke\r\n'@\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe way I see it, first you split on the delimiter, which gives you array of potentially empty values, then pad with nulls to correct length. With the examples present, it somehow also depends on the very presence of another row after, so reordering rows or truncating the table can change types. ",
