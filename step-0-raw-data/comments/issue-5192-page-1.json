    "body": "> While never passed they do work when they are in the `.bash_profile`\r\n\r\nWhich is also true of PowerShell aliases in your `$profile` when you launch PowerShell\r\n\r\nI think it's important to remember that PowerShell isn't something you use *under* bash, but something you use *in place of* bash. PowerShell is a shell just like bash and tsc. tsc doesn't use bash aliases, and bash doesn't use tsc aliases so there shouldn't be any expectation for PowerShell to use bash or tsc aliases nor for tsc or bash to use PowerShell aliases. Ideally, you would ssh to a system and never even touch bash, it would be PowerShell on the client side and server side. You can set your default shell in /etc/passwd to /usr/bin/powershell  on both client and server and never see bash again if you wanted.\r\n\r\n> I just worry about the user experience once an admin drops to PowerShell.\r\n\r\nI don't think that's an issue at all. Most Linux admins I've been exposed to understand concept of shells and understand that many things don't cross the shell wall. ",
