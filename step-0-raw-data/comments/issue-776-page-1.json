I guess if you don't like catch-all, you can catch at least the 4 exceptions listed there?\n\nAnyway, ClrFacade ends up calling PsAssemblyLoadContext.Load(), which only looked for following:\n/home/george/PowerShell/bin/Microsoft.PowerShell.PSReadLine.ni.dll\n/home/george/PowerShell/bin/Microsoft.PowerShell.PSReadLine.dll\nSince neither exists, it throws FileNotFoundException and give up.\n\nIt then goes to LoadFrom(), which repeats the call to Load(), and fails identically as the first call.  But since LoadFrom() did not have the catches, it gives up prematurely, and the DLL is never found/loaded.\n",
