    "body": "I am working only with the Microsoft.PowerShell.Sdk, I mean embedded PowerShell. I'm not briging more web to PowerShell, there is some requirements, not a lot, and it's mostly net5.0 improvements in old areas. I'm working on a NoName.PowerShell.Sdk, I have bug with SMA that need to be resolved and if an API is broken in a core module, I want to resolve it. \r\n\r\nA important point, Web mean 3rd parties and breaking changes. I see how my WebAssembly PR is complicated because I use a standard template from the aspnet team. Imagine, if someone dislike Dependency injection, another trimming etc.. Well, i only want to said Web is opiniated, Asp.Net is opiniated and a shell object... \r\n\r\nMicrosoft open source management for projects which had moved from netframework was a little bit too much strict in general. I understand it's a complicated move, the result is nice. Now in the net6.0 timeline, there is also a global move to be more relax with contributions. Microsoft is aware open source management à la Winform/WPF is toxic. What people are asking is interface, di, provider, logs, configuration, options and a good sdk, nothing complicated.\r\n\r\n Asp.net core is a bright result from a technical point of view and community is very happy. I am adapting owerShell inside Asp.Net, not in the other way, so I want to keep a cool Web mindset, not the Windows PowerShell old school. I think it's very important to say it, because to implement the other way, PowerShell should be a real language at core, it maybe will happen in 10 years and need PowerShell's Committee.\r\n\r\nTechnicaly, I would prefer a real msbuild sdk. It's easy to create it,  dotnet team have a lot (dotnet, worker, aspnet, blazor, webassembly, android etc..). It build embedded app, but I keep in mind it's complicated without a power-notshell committee ? \"A shell and a language\" are still a kind of problem to define to each platform. (Should Android but be a launcher in Android world and fetch my mail ?).\r\n\r\nFor the first quarter of the net6.0 timeline, I need to open issues on Path & FileLess, HttpClient and planned obsolescence in net5.0 to make any demos later. I open the issues, wait for feedback, update with the last technical info, discuss and will post some PR.\r\n\r\nA RFC is a very good idea. I don't see any reason to not ask community too, but I'm still thinking PowerShell is a bad name when we approach this area. People will ask for things that don't even exist in the available sandbox... \r\n\r\nIf you have any feedback to provide, i'm interested too. There is twitter's discussions with @SteveL-MSFT, I hope the discussion tab on github will be open soon, I would prefer to open there. Or join us on Twitter,  with 2.7k issues here, it can't be a place for free speech about innovations. 😅\r\n\r\n",

I hope there are many interested people.\r\n\r\nHistorically, PowerShell had only two hosts - conhost and graphical host (removed from the repo), and \"limited\" hosting support due to closedness and work only on Windows. Conhost did not evolve due to limitations of earlier versions of .Net Core. .Net Core is now richer and _the PowerShell hosting area is a great area for innovation_.\r\nWe have already encountered limitations in this area and eliminated some of them.

I mean, if later PowerShell want to use this new API as an SDK, they will have some works and a lot of folks asking for 2k of bugs because they want compatibility. Shell is an app. App is not a shell. I would more happy with \"make your own PowerShell\".\r\n\r\nIn 2020, my phone has 6Gb of RAM and the new arm processor of Apple is faster than an Intel i9, so with the 7.2 release, we should be able to use the plugin system and trim legacy dependencies (Win32, Registry, Network, etc..) , if I have a 2MB of SMA.dll (the size of the BCL in Mono.Wasm), the job will be done, it will be easy to embedded in any hardware, OS, dotnet compiled language and browser. \r\n\r\n> A default Blazor WebAssembly app when published should only be ~2MB of total transfer size when linked and compressed. You can reduce the size even further to ~1.6MB if you remove a bunch of the optional stuff added by the template (Bootstrap, timezone data, etc.). \r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/24433#issuecomment-666550019\r\n\r\n",
