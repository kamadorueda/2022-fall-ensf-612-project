That's fast.\r\n\r\nThen we look in the module analysis cache. Slower since we might have to touch the filesystem, but still acceptable. But still no result.\r\n\r\nSo now, we're forced to look on the module path for any module exporting a command or alias called `build`. This is because the cache might not capture modules newly installed or added. This is very slow, because:\r\n\r\n- We must *find* every module on the module path\r\n- We must inspect all manifests\r\n- In the cases where manifests use wildcards, we must do module analysis (where we analyse script modules to see if we can work out their exports).\r\n\r\nOnly after we have looked at every module on the module path can we fall back to invoking the script file on the PATH. And because the filesystem can always have a new module plonked onto it without going through PowerShell (imagine extracting a zip onto the module path in explorer.exe), the cache can never prove the negative, so we always must look. Meaning script invocation now gets much much slower.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Every script invocation without a slash in it takes a `Get-Module -ListAvailable` performance hit.",
