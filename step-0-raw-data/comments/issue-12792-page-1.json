    "body": "@iSazonov, what exactly do you mean? As a long-time developer on WiX (I designed and implemented many features in it, most notably package ref-counting that other installers use as well), I could probably explain if you can clarify what you meant.\r\n\r\nWhen the `<Icon>` is used, the binding (during linking, which is light.exe) knows to stream in a file reference; otherwise, when just a normal `<File>` is process the binder puts it in a cabinet that is later left external or streamed into the MSI based on `<Media>` entries (`<MediaTemplate>` provides default behavior and is often easier for most packages).\r\n\r\nMy main change here was to remove most GUIDs. They aren't needed, except for the `UpgradeCode` property (you normally want that fixed) and shared components without a single key path resource. In fact, just being a shared component - if it always resolves to the same key path - will get the same GUID. This change is mainly about letting WiX create a durable GUID based on the key path at build time, which is far more reliable and easier than people having to maintain it, which wasn't being done here and the main problem with files and registry values not getting cleaned up (they were ref-counted). See https://heaths.dev/setup/2020/05/13/simple-wix-project.html for more explanation and links to many of my old blog posts on what is now the VS Setup team blog (used to be my professional blog - which I used mostly for team purposes - up until a year or so ago).\n\n<blockquote><div>Heath Stewart’s Blog</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://heaths.dev/setup/2020/05/13/simple-wix-project.html\">Simple WiX Project</a></strong></div><div>Globally-unique identifiers (GUIDs) are often the brunt of jokes. Windows Installer packages (.msi files) are full of them, from the required ProductCode, to highly-recommended UpgradeCode, package codes, and required component GUIDs. Authoring an MSI doesn’t require you create and manage so many GUIDs, however. In fact, Windows Installer XML (WiX) has in the last few years made great strides in making sure you don’t have to, and recommends you don’t.</div></blockquote>",

If I can find time, there's some more clean-up I'd like to do (you can do almost everything in the .wxs itself, which makes it easier to maintain since it's not spread all over), but wasn't necessary for now. I also recommend passing parameters instead of setting environment variables, as the scope is smaller (though, at least you scope them to the current and child processes).",
