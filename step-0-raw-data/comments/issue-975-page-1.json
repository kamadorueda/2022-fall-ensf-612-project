Bash (and Zsh, and Csh) all execute\n\n``` sh\neval `/usr/libexec/path_helper -s`\n```\n\nin their respective `/etc/profile` files. The OS Xy way for PowerShell to do this would be to add a similar call to our system profile.\n\nHowever, `path_helper` was of course not designed with PowerShell in mind, and so it only can emit the `PATH` and `MANPATH` variables in two styles, C-shell and Bourne shell. We don't really have much of an option but to parse its output and reinterpret it for PowerShell.\n",

    "body": "@joeyaiello: \r\n\r\nHappy to chime in, but to be clear about what I can contribute: I know macOS pretty well; my go-to Linux platform for contrasting macOS with Linux is Ubuntu; however, I don't have a good sense of what's standard / typical across _all_ major Linux distros.\r\n\r\n* The issue at hand is not macOS-specific; Fedora (and, I presume, RedHat) also adds directories to `$PATH` in `/etc/profile`- despite that fact that  Fedora and Ubuntu (others?) have a separate, shell-independent file for defining system-wide environment variables, `/etc/environment`.\r\nOn Ubuntu, it is the latter that makes `$PATH` additions.  \r\n_Update: This is likely not a problem in LOCAL sessions, but would be with `ssh` - see below_.\r\n\r\n* Login shells - if they're POSIX-compatible - _de facto_ source `/etc/profile` _and_ `$HOME/.profile` - though I couldn't find evidence of that as a _requirement_ in the POSIX spec. (did I miss it?) - `$HOME/.profile` is mentioned as \"typically executed\" in http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/xrat/V4_xcu_chap02.html, but there's no mention of `/etc/profile`; `bash` allows preempting `$HOME/.profile` (but not `/etc/profile`) with Bash-specific alternatives (`$HOME/.bash_profile` (highest precedence) or (rarely used) `$HOME/.bash_login`); an overview of the behavior of the major POSIX-like shells (and `csh` variants, which I don't think we need to worry about) can be found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell#Configuration_files\r\n\r\n* What POSIX does mandate is support for the - rarely used - `$ENV` variable  \"if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option\" (whatever that means), which may point to a script to be sourced for _any_ interactive shell - whether it is a login shell or not - see http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_05_03. \r\n While this is the closest equivalent to PowerShell's `$PROFILE` (given that PowerShell has no concept of login vs. non-login shells), I've never seen it used in practice, and `bash` only honors it when it explicitly run in POSIX-compatibility mode.\r\n\r\n* On Linux, ~~the default shell is called as a _login_ shell _once_, when the user initially logs on to the OS.~~ Seemingly - at least on Ubuntu - a `/bin/sh` login shell is always used when a user logs in to the OS, which does process `/etc/profile`, and seemingly _all_ user processes (not just shells, and irrespective of whether or not they're POSIX-like shells) then _inherit process-level attributes_ from it, which notably includes environment variables , `umask` and `ulimit` values; others?\r\n\r\n  * However, system processes - such as the `ssh` server component - seemingly do _not_ inherit from this `sh` process, which means that remotely accessing a Linux machine with `ssh` sees the definitions from `/etc/profile` only if the remotely started shell instance itself processes it - which is why `ssh` starts the shells used as a _login_ shell.\r\n\r\n* On macOS, _every_ shell instance created via `Terminal.app`, the default terminal (and also third-party terminals such as `iTerm.app`) is a _login_ shell.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe fundamental question is to what extent PowerShell needs to play by these rules.\r\n\r\n* `/etc/profile` is the most important file, because it contains important environment definitions on macOS, and, as stated, on at least 1 major Linux distro.\r\n\r\n    * On Linux - at least on Ubuntu - that is not a concern for _local_ sessions, for the reasons explained above (all processes inherit the env. variables from `/etc/profile`, which is always processed when the user logs on to the OS, and  also from `/etc/environment`). \r\n\r\n      * It is, however, a concern for `ssh` sessions, whose server component itself does not process `/etc/profile`, so that shells created remotely via `ssh` must process `/etc/profile` themselves, which POSIX-like shells do, because `ssh` creates _login_ shells, by way of prefixing the invocation name (`$0`) with `-`, which the shells are expected to honor.\r\n\r\n    * On macOS, the `ssh` problem applies too, but even local sessions are expected to process `/etc/profile`, because local shell processes on macOS do _not_ inherit from a single `sh` process that processes `/etc/profile`; instead, the terminal programs on macOS create _login_ shells _by default_, every time a shell is instantiated, so if PowerShell is the default shell, the important `$PATH` additions - possibly among other initializations - won't happen even for local shells - see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6027#issuecomment-360638685\r\n\r\n* It is debatable whether PowerShell should be expected to honor `~/.profile` or even `$ENV`.  Arguably, only honoring `/etc/profile` is sufficient, as an exception, due to its shell-transcendent importance.\r\n\r\nThe approach proposed by @joeyaiello is robust with respect to honoring the _environment variables_, but:\r\n\r\n* it comes with a performance penalty that on macOS _every_ terminal-program created instance will pay (with PowerShell as the default shell); however, it doesn't apply to direct invocation of `powershell`.\r\n\r\n* the honoring may not be complete, as `/etc/profile` may contain commands such as `umask` and `ulimit` (not sure what other commands need to be considered).\r\n\r\nFor PowerShell to detect being invoked as a _login_ shell it must examine the equivalent of `$0` (`argv[0]`) - the invocation name - to look for `-` as the 1st char., because that is the mechanism used by:\r\n * `ssh`\r\n * macOS terminal programs\r\n * Bash's `exec` builtin when a shell is spawned with the `-l` option.\r\n\r\n`[Environment]::CommandLine` doesn't reflect such such a custom invocation name, however (it contains the path to PowerShell _DLL_, which is a bug yet to be resolved - see https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/20562). As a workaround, PowerShell could determine its invocation name via the standard `ps` utility, using command `ps -o comm= $PID`.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the major POSIX-like shells also support explicit invocation with option `-l` to create a login shell - PowerShell has no equivalent.\r\n_Update: `-l` is now supported - see #9528_\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nFinally, PowerShell's current startup behavior with respect to profiles (and other aspects) is fundamentally at odds with that of POSIX-like shells in that it loads its profiles _by default_, irrespective of whether the shell is interactive or not (or a login shell, which PowerShell has no concept of) - see #3743\r\n\r\n~~This means, for instance, that with PowerShell as the default shell, `$PROFILE` is also sourced in the invisible login shell instance that is created on OS session startup on Linux.~~  (see above).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Shell variables aren't seen by child processes.\r\n\r\nTry the following (from Bash or any other POSIX-like shell) to verify that a true environment variable is indeed inherited by PowerShell (this syntax creates a command-scoped environment variable):\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=foo pwsh -noprofile -c '$env:NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS'\r\nfoo\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso note that such inheritance is a system-level feature that exists independently of PowerShell.\r\n\r\nIf you have a reproducible case where this inheritance indeed doesn't work, please create a new issue.\r\n",

Shell variables are by design limited to the given shell process.\r\n\r\nWhile in `cmd.exe` _all_ variables are environment variables, both PowerShell and POSIX-like shells such as `bash` distinguish between shell(-only) variables and environment variables.\r\n\r\nWhile In PowerShell you always use the same, distinct syntax for both creating and querying  environment variables (`$env:...`), in POSIX like shells _both_ types of variables are _queried_ the same, namely with just the `$` sigil, as in `$NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`; that is when you _get_ a variable value, the syntax isn't telling you whether you're accessing a _shell_(-only) or an _environment variable_.\r\n\r\nIn POSIX-like shells, it's the _declaration_ of a variable that matters:\r\n\r\nAs a _stand-alone statement_, `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=foo` creates a _shell_(-only) variable - by design, no child process will see it.\r\n\r\nWhat I used above - _prepending_ variable assignments directly to a command invocation  (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=foo pwsh ....`) - is _syntactic sugar_ for defining _command-scoped_ environment variables - only the child process created sees them, not the remainder of the script.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a stand-alone statement to create an environment variable, use the `export` utility: \r\n\r\n```sh\r\nexport NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn POSIX-like shells:\r\n\r\n* To see all _environment_ variables, run `env` (in PowerShell you'd use `Get-ChildItem env:`)\r\n\r\n* To check whether a given variable is an environment variable, use `typeset -p <name>` (works in `bash`, `ksh`, `zsh`): if the output contains either `-x` or `export` (`zsh`), the variable is an environment variable (in PowerShell you'd use `Get-Item env:<name>`).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
