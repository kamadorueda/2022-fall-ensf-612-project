Pretty much \"does this contain any character which isn't in our identifier token pattern\" which is a lot more strict then PowerShell's standards.\r\n\r\nI think your plan is probably the best bet.  They use the same pattern for top level statements as well (`<Program>$.<Main>$()`) so it should hopefully catch future additions.",
