This time I tried Ubuntu Xenial, installed omi, dsc and pwsh-preview but I get the same issue. No DSC Resources are found. \r\n\r\nThese are the docs for reference: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/getting-started/lnxgettingstarted?view=powershell-6\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\nAfter a bit more playing around with a custom resource to see if I can get it working I encountered the below warning. This was emitted when i tried to compile a configuration using my own resource. The resource doesn't show up in Get-DscResource but i thought why not try anyway...\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nWARNING: Embedded resources are not support on Linux or macOS.  Please see https://aka.ms/PSCoreDSC for more details\r\n```\r\nThe link is broken it seems so I'm still not sure if what I'm trying to do is supported or not? this suggests not whilst #9834 suggests it is...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dsc/getting-started/lnxgettingstarted\">Get started with Desired State Configuration (DSC) for Linux - PowerShell</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
