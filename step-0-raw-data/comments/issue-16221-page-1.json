    "body": "WG-Engine discussed this today. Our opinion is that this is inextricably tied to other issues we've seen around wildcard escaping in the past. See #7999 for more information.\r\n\r\nOur inclination is that it's not feasible to fix this issue \"just\" for this one case without taking a look at the larger scope of work involved here. An idea proposed in terms of properly fixing this issue was to define a new Path API which wraps the path string itself, and contains some metadata for indicating whether the path has been resolved already, and so forth.\r\n\r\nDoing this would require rewriting large portions of the filesystem provider code (and potentially other providers as well), and as such it's unlikely this will get a satisfactory fix until the filesystem provider is rewritten.\r\n\r\nFor the time being, we're resolving this issue as a duplicate of #7999 and we expect that it will be resolved in the course of that issue, although we don't currently have a concrete timeline of when that scope of work is happening just yet.\r\n\r\nThanks for the report! ðŸ’– ",
