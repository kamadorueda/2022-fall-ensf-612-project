I have seen this in the past but to me it seemed that the problem disappeared after the rename to pwsh but I might be wrong. I remember trying to reproduce using clean uninstall and install in the past but could not. I am wondering if this only occurs when someone performs a certain action with the installed product that makes it not remove the folder.",

    "body": "Ok, So I tried reproing by installing 6.0.0 and the installing 6.0.1 on top of it and I cannot repro. Please show us the content of the old folder. Should you have ever created a file in the installation folders (which can easily happen because the default working directory is in the installation director) then it won't remove the folder by design (but still the old files). If a PowerShell cmdlet happens to drop a file in the installation folder without the need for it then this could maybe be be considered an issue but otherwise I'd mark it as `CANNOT REPRO`.\r\nNote that I am only speaking about the Windows Installer but maybe the case of files getting into the installation folder after installation applies probably to *nix systems as well.\r\n@RichardSiddaway : The issue that you see with RC2 is related to the problem of pre-release versioning that was discovered only at release time, see similar issue #5834 where it was decided that it is not worth putting any effort into pre-release version because that is the nature of pre-releases. Just uninstall/remove RC2.",
