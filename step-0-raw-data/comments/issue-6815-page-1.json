Some of these would be in the grey area in terms of official support (like amazon linux) - but it would still seem weird to lose support over an intermediary tool requirement - especially since these are some of the toughest targets for adoption - so making it even harder for a trite reason seems like an adoption anti-pattern.\r\n\r\nAnyone have coding experience doing github full version enumerations in pure bash?",
