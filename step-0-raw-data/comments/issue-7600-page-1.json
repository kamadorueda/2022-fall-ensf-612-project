    "body": "Sorry @iSazonov , I don't understand the relevance of that transformer. Yes, it also demonstrates the first workaround demonstrated by the repro script (`UseWorkaround_FailGracefully`).\r\n\r\nEven if we decide that all the code works exactly as desired, then this is a doc bug, because you can't tell from reading the docs that it's how you should fail (docs incorrectly instruct you to throw an ATME if transformation fails, which will break further binding, which cannot possibly be what the user wanted).\r\n\r\n(To be clear, my preferred option is to change PS to treat all ATMEs the same way that ATMEs which wrap PSInvalidExceptions are today. But even if we decide against that, _something_ should be done; this is painful to figure out.)",

I think the code works as expected and it is doc issue - we should add that we should throw `ArgumentTransformationMetadataException` with inner `PSInvalidCastException` exception.
