    "body": "I could tell from the code that the `--` (DashDash) caused any further 'parameters' to be considered arguments (in the AST), but still find it surprising that they are flagged as 'CommandName'.  Without modification, PSReadLine will continue to highlight them as parameters, but if changed to prioritize CommandName flagged tokens highlighting as command, it would be alarming to a user.\r\n\r\nI also think its an error, but maybe the 'nix shells do the same thing, that the `--` (DashDash) can be accepted as a command name at the same time it triggers further parameters to be ignored.  This would be similar to a redirect being accepted both as a command name, and redirection at the same time.\r\n\r\nI did test changes to the parser to change this behavior.  I had to add a couple `when` clauses to a couple of switch case statements to cause the 'command' `--` to not trigger this behavior and to be properly marked as a command name, when the context of the parser was 'CommandName' or 'CommandNameAfterInvocationOperator'.  I haven't determined what the correct change would be for the parameter's being marked as command names though.\r\n\r\nThere also still seems to be no documentation on the topic, as it relates to PowerShell.  Is it a recent addition, or in there from day one?  Looking at the code, I'd be willing to bet its relatively recent addition and it was added hastily on the end of a section that normally found parameters that were meant to be command names …  unfortunately I cannot trace the blame (it was a new file when the code first appeared, so its been here since 6.0, which I can prove it was in Windows PowerShell 5.1).\r\n\r\nOnly showing the section of importance:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/5974afaa8daf9ed6fc45077eff899088a650e1e2/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/Parser.cs#L6281-L6289\r\n\r\nI am thinking the fix here it to use a when clause for `!sawDashDash` on the case statement, it seems to do the trick.\r\n\r\n",
