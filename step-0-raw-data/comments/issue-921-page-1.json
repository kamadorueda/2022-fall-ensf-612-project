    "body": "What is the purpose of this bug?  Is it to:\n1.  Have symbolicLink.Target return the full path?  On Linux, if you created the symbolic link using a relative path, it will store the target using relative path.  If you type \"ls -l\", you will see that the linked path is whatever path you used when you created it, even if it doesn't exist.  \n2.  Or is the problem that Get-ChildItem doesn't show files that you think should be there?  Keep in mind that on Linux, the symbolic link behaves likes a file, so Get-ChildItem should just return the link itself, not what's in the directory that the link points to.  I know on Windows, the behavior is different. \n\nWe had a similar problem when dealing with delete.  On Windows, deleting a symbolic link that points to a directory will potentially delete everything in the directory.  But on Linux, deleting the link does not affect the directory at all.\n",
