    "body": "1) there are no guarantees that a higher version of a module will be WinCompat-compatible, in which case user experience will be bad again as before deny-list fix.\r\n2) `is the compat list only ever looked after the module is found to not loadable in the current session?`\r\nYes, assuming `found to not loadable` means that the module is under System32 and {either has `CompatiblePSEditions` missing from `psd1` or `CompatiblePSEditions` does not contain `Core`}. Such modules used to be called `Core-incompatible` before WinCompat and were generating `PSEditionNotSupported / Module '{0}' does not support current PowerShell edition '{1}'. Its supported editions are '{2}'. Use 'Import-Module -SkipEditionCheck' to ignore the compatibility of this module.` error.\r\nAlso the compat list is checked when WinCompat is enforced with `-UseWindowsPowerShell` parameter.",
