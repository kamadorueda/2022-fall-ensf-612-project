Ideally I'd ask someone on the PS team (possibly multiple people) who is familiar with the code path(s) in question.\r\n\r\nFrom a brief look through, I would guess we shouldn't see any adverse effects from always handling BigInteger the same way as we do other numeric types; from what I can see, handling it in this way doesn't break anything immediately obvious, and it also solves the issue raised in #11628 \r\n\r\nThe other code paths using IsNumeric(), as you'd expect, all deal with handling numeric values in various scenarios (I see formatting code, remoting code, and parameter binding code, among a couple others). At least intuitively, I _think_ we're best off continuing to handle them uniformly, and adding a standard case in for BigInteger, but as I said... I lack the familiarity others may have to really make a solid call on that.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I agree the right solution is to review and handle them all. If we have time to do so prior to 7.0 GA, that'd be my preference. If not, this more minimal change will prevent breaking existing scripts in at least this specific scenario. It mightn't be perfect, but it's a better state than we're sitting in currently. 🙂 ",

If that change is reverted, the above is fixed.\r\n\r\nThis next issue exists in both branches:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS> [string][BigInt]0\r\nInvalidArgument: Cannot convert value \"0\" to type \"System.String\". Error: \"Object must implement IConvertible.\"\r\n\r\nPS> [BigInt]$null\r\nOperationStopped: Invalid cast from 'System.Int32' to 'System.Numerics.BigInteger'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn PS5/6, the first cast converts to a string as expected, while the second cast also fails though with a more clear exception. Treating a BigInteger as though it were a Numeric primitive in `LanguagePrimitives.RebuildConversionCache` seems to be the culprit. One way to fix this could be to create a new converter method [such as in this update to the WrapBigintLiterals branch](https://github.com/gurnec/PowerShell/commit/fb567009d8386521d3ce3c0ff4a61cef75fb0836) which treats BigInteger as any other object when converting it to a string (which eventually causes `IFormattable.ToString` to be called), but has the `.TokenText` special case from `ConvertNumericToString`.\r\n\r\nI wish I were qualified to comment on whether or not other issues exist... but I thought I'd at least comment on what I'd found so far.",

Thanks for the ping @iSazonov! 🙂 \r\n\r\nEDIT: Some tinkering later, and I think @gurnec has the right idea; having PS treat BigInteger as a regular number in _all_ circumstances is not the way to go. It doesn't implement some of the interfaces necessary for those conversion paths to work correctly (most notably `IConvertible`). Since most conversions with it are currently behaving OK, we just need to add a few additional ones to iron out the edge cases. That shouldn't be too tricky to do. 🙂 ",

They really need a thorough pass in a separate PR and I'd rather not complicate the commits here too much.\r\n\r\nA few things seem to have been caught by my autoformatter, I can remove those if we need to, but I've already got plans to do a good style pass on LanguagePrimitives anyway 🙂 \r\n\r\nI don't think we should incorporate this into `IsNumeric()` directly. The code paths that are calling this seem to pretty commonly assume that a result of `true` from that method means that the type they're asking about implements certain interfaces, which usually includes `IConvertible` -- and BigInteger does not implement this interface. Changing the IsNumeric() method now without thoroughly examining all the code paths using it is asking for a whole heap of exceptions to get thrown all over the place.\r\n\r\nThe changes as they are allow things to keep treating BigInteger as kind of its own thing, which it is, while also adding the necessary conversion paths for it to appear like a more normal number to users and allow it to be used as such.",

Whether it makes sense to start down the road of making BigInts more like the other simple numeric types as opposed to keeping things simpler isn't really my call....",

I don't think it should require _quite_ that complex of a solution though; you'll note the original `ConvertStringToInteger()` essentially does the same thing, just doesn't support converting to the BigInteger value itself. Shouldn't be too complex to work that in a little more effectively in there.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Yeah the issue is essentially that `GetIntegerSystemConverter()` doesn't have a way to handle BigInteger and just returns `null`, which isn't expected in the method. Added some extra handling for when the target type is BigInteger that sorts it out reasonably neatly. 🙂 ",

It is, after all, much closer to a primitive value than pretty much any other struct that is provided in .NET.\r\n\r\nI think it's likely to be more useful to folks this way in that it avoids hitting an edge case where if you expect a number as input and use `if ($number) { ... }` to determine if it's zero or not (not strictly advisable, but convenient at times) then bigints behave the same as all the other number types we have direct access to in PS.",

For one, even `[decimal]` doesn't support all the conversions you list.\r\n\r\nSome of those I would _like_ to fix (especially the ones involving rounding to bigint), but they will likely have to be addressed on an individual basis. For instance, I don't think it's a good idea (or really possible) for `bigint` to be falling back to `double` like the lower integer types tend to when you create fractional values via division, since `double`'s range is significantly narrower than `bigint`'s. I do appreciate the concise summary of the differences, though! ",

    "body": "@daxian-dbw yeah so if I take out the changes in the actual `ConvertStringToInteger` method, the following will happen:\r\n\r\n1. The `Assert()` call will fail, because the `TypeCode` for `BigInteger` is the same as the type code for `object`.\r\n2. If we only bypass that, the `Convert.ChangeType()` call can fail since `BigInteger` is not `IConvertible`, so the conversion cannot be handled by that method. This is a fallback method (when the number can't be parsed directly) so I'm not sure how often this path would be hit, but it's still a potential concern.\r\n\r\nLooking at pulling off the latest commit now, might need some parts, will need to verify.",
