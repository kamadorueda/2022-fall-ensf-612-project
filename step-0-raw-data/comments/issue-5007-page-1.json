I don't have a strong opinion about whether \"Content\" should include the BOM when present or not.  I do feel fairly strongly, however, that the inclusion or exclusion of a BOM should be consistent across the PowerShell built-in APIs.  Consider that\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n[System.IO.Path]::GetTempFileName() |\r\n    % {\r\n        Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alx9r/BootstraPS/master/Resources/utf-8-bom.txt -OutFile $_\r\n        [int](Get-Content $_)[0]\r\n    }\r\n```\r\noutputs 116.  In other words, if you download the file to the file system and retrieve it the \"Contents\" does not include a BOM but if you download the file to memory and inspect the \"Contents\" there is a BOM.  It seems like either both should include the BOM or neither should include the BOM.",

    "body": "It looks like the discrepancy between the decoding behavior of `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Get-Content` lies in the way that they decode the byte stream to a string.  Specifically, the difference is as follows:\r\n\r\n* the file contents read from the filesystem using `Get-Content` [is decoded](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c1c5344a8897262433141ecbc13bb06ac2c4bbef/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemContentStream.cs#L884) by [`System.IO.StreamReader`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.streamreader(v=vs.110).aspx)\r\n* the file contents read from an http response using `Invoke-WebRequest` is decoded by the [PowerShell project's `StreamToString`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d20d53eaacafd4645ea668bd46e62093d3f3e503/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/StreamHelper.cs#L362)\r\n\r\n`StreamReader` is aware of the byte-order mark and seems to honor endianness during conversion.  `StreamToString`, on the other hand, uses [`System.Text.Encoding`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.encoding(v=vs.110).aspx).  While `System.Text.Encoding` includes support for decoding different endianness, `StreamToString` does not interpret a byte order mark at the beginning of the stream to adjust the decoding to match.\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\nByte-order mark aware conversion using `Invoke-WebRequest` and `System.IO.StreamReader` can be achieved as follows:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$response = Invoke-WebRequest https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/404e876740aa65b1bdd17ce614060eb88e3e7da9/test/powershell/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/WebCmdlets.Tests.ps1\r\n\r\n# this uses StreamToString which ignores the byte-order-mark, so it is the first character\r\n[int]$response.Content[0] # 65279\r\n\r\n# StreamReader interprets the byte-order-mark strips it, so the first character is the pound symbol\r\n[int][System.IO.StreamReader]::new($response.RawContentStream).ReadToEnd()[0] # 35\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implications for Endianness Mismatch\r\n\r\nThere seems to be another implication to `Invoke-WebRequest`'s use of `StreamToString`.  Because `StreamToString` decodes without considering the byte-order-mark it should be expected that the `.Content` property of the object returned by `Invoke-WebRequest` would contain incorrect data in the case of an endianness mismatch between whatever computer wrote the file that is served to `Invoke-WebRequest` and the computer invoking `Invoke-WebRequest`.",
