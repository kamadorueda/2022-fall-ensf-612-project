    "body": "`&` as a suffix is an operator that places the previous pipeline in a new job for execution. It also acts as a statement separator much like `;` does.\r\n\r\nSo in each of those examples the `[type]` is run in a background job and the following statement is sent to the current session as regular output. You can see the output from the background job by doing `Get-Job | Receive-Job`\r\n\r\nThe first example is precisely equivalent to running `[char] &` and `{!{}}` as two completely separate commands.\r\n\r\nIf your intention is to use `&` as the normal invocation operator it needs to be the _first_ thing in the statement, and given the reproduction examples given here I'd imagine you want to cast the result of some operation to a specific type after it completes. In that case you'd use parentheses like so: `[char](& {!{}})`",
