    "body": "It's true; I learned the term in a college class (don't remember if it was a straight-up CS course or a required-for-CS stats course).\r\n\r\nThe etymology of the term is simple, though: suppose you are drawing some colored marbles out of a sack, one at a time. From this you can pose the question \"what is the chance you will draw N of the same color in a row\" or somesuch. Naturally this depends on the numbers of different-colored marbles in the sack, but it also depends on your drawing behavior: after drawing a marble, do you put it back into the sack before drawing the next one? (i.e. do you *replace* it?)\r\n\r\nHence \"selection WITH replacement\" (putting the marbles back as you draw them), or \"selection WITHOUT replacement\" (don't put any marbles back in).\r\n\r\nIf *I* saw an `-AllowDuplicates` parameter here, I might also be confused. I could wonder if it meant that if there are duplicates in the input, then without this param I will get an error? (because otherwise they are not \"allowed\")\r\n\r\nSo I feel like the better tradeoff would be to use the more precise technical term. Yes, people might have to read the doc if they haven't had a stats course; but better to raise the general educational level of everyone than keep the confusing term for everyone (honestly, everyone would probably have to read the doc to understand what `-AllowDuplicates` would actually mean for this cmdlet, too).",
