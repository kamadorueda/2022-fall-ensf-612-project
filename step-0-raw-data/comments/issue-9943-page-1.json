    "body": "The way `#requires -Version` works currently, it doesn't do a version comparison, but instead looks up the version in `$PSVersionTable.PSCompatibleVersions` which is supposed to be a mechanism that keeps track of PowerShell versions that are strictly incompatible with the current runtime. Arguably that mechanism isn't used properly, but it's still the way the logic works currently.\r\n\r\nSo for that reason, I think the @PowerShell/powershell-committee should review the mechanism of `#requires -Version` in this PR.\r\n\r\nBut also, if we go down the route of changing that mechanism, we should strip out the for-loop entirely and just do a version comparison.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the change that needs to occur is to add/change the right version in the list here:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/29e21470d9e0a6edd163bcff9b1574ccf557b18f/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/PSVersionInfo.cs#L108",

They should also validate 7.0 and when 7.1 is released the tests have to be updated to deal with the incremented minor version. This is fine but it would be best if the test would fail as soon as the PowerShell minor version is incremented and the test is not updated. I'm thinking about adding a test for 7.1 which should throw, once it doesn't throw, the test will fail and the author would be reminded that the test needs to be updated.\r\n\r\nI'll add some more test logic and maybe revise the current once a little bit if that is alright?\r\n\r\nAlso, we currently have the same issue with PowerShell 6.2\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10071039/62800127-e9d5f800-bae2-11e9-92ff-150f70e846c1.png)\r\n\r\nShould I create a PR for the 6.2 branch as well?\r\n",
