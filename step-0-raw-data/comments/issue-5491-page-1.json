    "body": "`FileWebRequest` and `FtpWebRequest`? I believe `WebRequest` is what was being used in Windows PowerShell. It may be possible to fall back to those when the URI is FTP or FILE, but, many of the options and features in place are built around `HttpClient` and wont work for `WebRequest`. I'm not a fan of that. \r\n\r\nThis somewhat falls in line with my suggestion for separating the web cmdlets (and related cmdlets) from the rest of the project and leaving a very simple file downloader cmdlet baked in. My gut tells me that there is a missing cmdlet here. I realize it is somewhat redundant with IWR and IRM, but a cmdlet that just downloads a file with very basic options and no processing overhead seems desirable. All of the value in IRM and IWR is tied to their post-processing capabilities. They support `-OutFile` but so much overhead goes to processing the request before it reaches that point.  The download cmdlet could be expanded to support a wide variety of protocols (i.e FTP & TFTP) that make no sense for the HTTP processing of IWR and IRM, \r\n\r\nAlso, FTP might be a prime candidate for a PSProvider and to be used with `Get-Content` and friends. I think managing an FTP server with those would be awesome as there is way more to FTP than get and put.",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT for a full FTP solution, sure. But, I'm willing to bet 90% or more of all FTP user stories are \"I have an FTP URI to a file I need to download\". \r\n\r\nWith Windows PowerShell 5.1 it is as simple as `iwr ftp://server.com/path/file.txt -outfile file.txt` On linux and mac it's similarly easy to do that with wget/curl. If we make it painful, the user will shell out. I'd rather we have a native solution.\r\n\r\nI see room for both, a network file PS drive (for NFS, FTP, SFTP, FTPS, TFTP, etc) and a simple download cmdlet (for HTTP and the others).\r\n\r\nI'd envision the PS drive being defined with `New-PSDrive` like all other providers. I may want to connect to more than one FTP server and possibly even copy between them or copy/move between FTP and NFS. This would accommodate the user story \"I have a network file resource I need to manage.\" It would be similar to how SMB is managed by the FileSystem provider.\r\n\r\nI'd envision the download cmdlet to be very basic taking a URI, optional credentials and optional path. `Invoke-Download ftp://server.com/path/file.txt` would be the minimum required and it would save the file in the current folder similar to how wget operates, unless the file path is supplied\r\n\r\n`Invoke-Download -Uri <Uri> [-Credential <PSCrdential>] [-OutFile <String>]`\r\n\r\nIt would work off the URI schema and we could plug network/transport protocols as needed. It would be intentionally feature poor to become the de facto file download cmdlet in PowerShell for all protocols.\r\n\r\n@dragonwolf83 \r\n`Receive`  doesn't really make sense. That implies it is server initiated, in most cases it would not be.  in FTP, downloads are client initiated. `Get` and `Set` make sense, but if we are to generalize a cmdlet that may also work with protocols that `send`/`receive`, `Invoke` makes sense.

The creation of the new provider could be done in parallel with the improvement of the Provider meta code improvements so long as those improvements do not break the public API. if the improvements are just in the FileSystem provider, then it could definitely be done in parallel as it shouldn't have any effect on a new provider.",
