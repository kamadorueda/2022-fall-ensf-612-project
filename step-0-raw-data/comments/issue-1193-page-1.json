It may be worth clarifying in the [docs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/docs-conceptual/learn/remoting/WSMan-Remoting-in-PowerShell-Core.md) what the psremoting setup procedure is and removing the reference to this issue. Let me know what you're thinking and I'll happily go submit a pull request to the docs repo.",

    "body": "After installing PS 7.1 and in the installer checking \"Enable Remoting\" or whatever the option was I couldn't remote. Full details on this [SO post here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65131931). \r\n\r\nI found a kind of solution which is giving the windows user I'm trying to connect with Full Control of `C:\\Windows\\System32\\PowerShell\\7.1.0`, but I'd obviously like to know if something else has gone wrong and it seems kinda of related to what this installer was doing though I used Enable-PSRemoting in a 7.1 isntance so not sure... \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated!",
