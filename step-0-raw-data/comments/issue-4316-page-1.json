    "body": "I like this quite a bit. Compare-Object has long been... lacklustre... in implementation. I would personally also prefer if rather than `==`, `<=`, and `=>` symbols for the grouping (or indeed even for the current behaviour) the `SideIndicator`s were changed to match the actual parameters the objects are passed to (i.e., `ReferenceSet`, `DifferenceSet`, and `Both`)\r\n\r\nCurrently the default display is actually surprisingly difficult to make sense of in my opinion with any appreciably large comparison sets. It may even make more sense for the default display to actually do a `Format-Table -GroupBy SideIndicator` similar to how `GetChildItem` will group the table display by folder in a recursive search. It would make comprehending the data you're getting significantly less befuddling. :) ",

Can I suggest you create a new issue to propose the grouped output? \r\n\r\nAs for the `.SideIndicator` property values: I fear that ship has sailed, as the value of that property is used programmatically. (We could transform the values just _for display_, but the resulting discrepancy between what is displayed and what you need to use programmatically may be confusing).\r\n\r\nAs an aside: It's unfortunate that the property wasn't defined as an `[enum]` type to begin with.\r\n\r\nPersonally it took me a while to remember the logic of `<=` vs. `=>`; here's how I remember it now: the arrow points to the side the object at hand is _exclusive to_.",

I don't feel strongly about this, and Ive updated the original post to mention `-UsingSet` - renamed to `-SetOperation` - as an alternative.\r\n\r\nRe `-Group`, I do see your point: piping to `Group-Object SideIndicator` is conceptually cleaner.\r\nHowever, that is at odds with the proposed implementation of returning the _unwrapped_ elements from the set operations, in which case `... | Group-Object SideIndicator` wouldn't work.\r\nWe would then need an opt-in to have the output objects wrapped (as currently happens by default) - which sounds clunky too.\r\nAny thoughts?\r\n",
