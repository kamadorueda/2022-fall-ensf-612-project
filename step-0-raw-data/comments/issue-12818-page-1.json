Reducing lines & repetition is great, but if we end up with lines > 1 screen wide a lot of folks will just end up splitting it up into more lines again.\r\n\r\nAlso... if we're redefining this and adding new names/syntaxes/etc I'd _much_ prefer the `Parameter` prefix on every property name to go away. We already have the clear context that this is in a `[parameter]` attribute -- I don't think we also need to specify that it's a `Parameter`SetName, it's (IMO) plenty clear to call it `SetName` or even just `Set` in that context -- CmdletBinding should still use `DefaultParameterSet` (drop the `Name`, _please_, it's so long!) for clarity.\r\n\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nfunction Some-Function {\r\n    [CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSet = 'DefaultSet')]\r\n    param(\t\r\n\t[Parameter(Mandatory, Group = 'Group1', SetName = 'Set1')]\r\n\t$Param1,\r\n\r\n\t[Parameter(Mandatory, Group = 'Group1', SetName = 'Set2')]\r\n\t$Param2,\r\n\r\n\t[Parameter(Mandatory, Group = 'Group1', SetName = 'Set3')]\r\n\t$Param3,\r\n\r\n\t[Parameter(Mandatory, Group = 'Group2', SetName = 'SetA')]\r\n\t$Param4,\r\n\r\n\t[Parameter(Mandatory, Group = 'Group2', SetName = 'SetB')]\r\n\t$Param5,\r\n\r\n\t[Parameter(Mandatory, Group = 'Group2', SetName = 'SetC')]\r\n\t$Param6,\r\n    )\r\n    ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHmm. Still not sold on the groups. `Set` and `Group` seem fairly interchangeable and prone to confusion tbh.\r\n\r\nAlso, allowing mutliple default parameter sets would need different syntax I think?  `[CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSet = 'SetA', 'SetB')]` is ambiguous; we'd need at least `[CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSet = @( 'SetA', 'SetB') )]` to be able to be clear about which values belong to which property.

Define one or more groups within the block as string arrays. To make it even easier, set it up so that any parameters not included in any groups are automatically included available in all groups. \r\n\r\nTo accommodate slightly more complex scenarios, you could add a keyword option for the group definitions to account for specialized functions like 'set', 'exclusivity', and 'allsets'. 'Set'  is a normal parameter set, while the second can be used to specify one or more collections of mutually exclusive parameters. This would allow for multiple parameters to all be included in one or mote sets, but use of any single one in an exclusion group blocks use of others within the same exclusion set. The 'allsets' type would be a special optimism type that could only be used once, and would serve to intentionally include specific parameters in all sets. If used, then PowerShell would generate an error in the event not all parameters were accounted for in at least one set group.\r\n\r\nThis approach would make it easy for devs and also for Parsing the help for users using the proposed augments to format as well. The only change I would propose here would be a simple indicator to mark a parameter as being part of an exclusivity set for a given parameter group.",

You could likely even leverage the mandatory indicator to narrow down the possible sets in the absence of sufficient other identifiers to indicate the target set.Â For really complex mixed scenarios, perhaps add a second keyword that could also be used only once to indicate a set as the default...or perhaps a set order keyword (similar to the positionalÂ one for parameters) to give control over the order, though i think it better to just use the definition order...the other seems like it would only add confusion.\nAdmittedly I'm a bit lacking in 'true' programming expertise for the last part...I've been scripting since the batch file days, and have been using PowerShell since Monad,Â with lots ofÂ experience writing my own modules as well, but no real .NET or other 'real' programming knowledge outside of using a dll or consuming an API.\n\n",

Obviously if you end up with 50 different Sets you might run into some speed challenges, but to my non-programmer eyes at least, the below is easier to read down than the current approach, and I would personally find it easier than trying to shove everything into the param block. There's still some repetition (I don't know that you could really avoid that), but it's more logically organized.\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Get-Something {\r\n\t[CmdletBinding()]\r\n\tparam (\r\n\t\t[Parameter()]\r\n\t\t$Param1,\r\n\t\t[Parameter()]\r\n\t\t$Param2,\r\n\t\t[Parameter()]\r\n\t\t$Param3,\r\n\t\t[Parameter()]\r\n\t\t$Param4,\r\n\t\t[Parameter()]\r\n\t\t$Param5,\r\n\t\t[Parameter()]\r\n\t\t$Param6\r\n\t)\r\n\t\r\n\tParamSetGroup {\r\n\t\t[ParamSet(Default=$true)]\r\n\t\t$Set1 = {Param1, Param4, Param6},\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t[ParamSet()]\r\n\t\t$Set2 = {Param4, Param5},\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t[ParamSet()]\r\n\t\t$Set3 = {\r\n\t\t\t(Param1, Mandatory=$true),\r\n\t\t\t(Param4),\r\n\t\t\t(Param6)\r\n\t\t},\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t[ParamExclusivity()]\r\n\t\t$Set4 = {Param4, Param6},\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t[ParamAllSets()]\r\n\t\t$Set5 = {Param2, Param3}\r\n\t}\r\n        ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe net result of the above would be as follows:\r\n\r\n - Specify param2 and/or param3 = $Set1 is selected\r\n - Specify jusst param1 = $Set3 is selected (because of the mandatory)\r\n - Specify param1 and param4 = $Set1 is selected\r\n - Specify param1, param6, and param4 (in that order) = $Set3 is selected, but error is thrown for param4\r\n \r\nThe one scenario the above doesn't necessarily account for would be the need for mutual exclusivity specific to a single 'set' definition, but my though here is perhaps to use something like a 'Group' keyword in the ParamExclusivity definition to allow targeting - ``[ParamExclusivity(Group=$Set1)]``\r\n",

    "body": "Perhaps this one comes down more to mindset I guess, and I'm certainly not trying to imply that your approachÂ is bad, or thatÂ mine is superior.Â For me personally, defining everything at the parameter level,Â even using the current approach, hasÂ proven challenging to master because it's too muddled together.IÂ always end up missing something,Â or causing PowerShell to throw errors because it couldn't properly determine the intended set definitively. I alwaysÂ end up having to either model it outside of PowerShell and translate it back in, or scrapping the use ofÂ sets completely.\nBy separating it out to is own construct, I can build my parameters first, then organize them into logical groups in what (again, to me personally) is a visually and logically consistent manner. I build each set all at once for a particular usage pattern, can specify in line ifÂ the parameter is mandatory for that specific set, and have a simple mechanism for setting exclusivity globally or at the set level...though with a simpler nomenclature than the dynamic parameters that gaveÂ me the idea. With your approach, while simplified language wise, itÂ actually decreases usability for me personally by putting more elements into the same space, making it harder for me to ensure I account for everything.\n\nAs for the multiple groups of sets, I guess I'm unclear on that one....I think it wouldn't be overly difficult to accommodate however if you use nested hash tables, or add another type to hold a collectionÂ in,Â similar in manner to dynamic parameters....like a dictionary or something, butÂ more naively accessible.\n\nBetter still perhaps might be to incorporate something like my approach as an underlying framework that powers your approach, then supporting both to appeal to more variability in mind set. For those that can process everything all together, it provides for shortee overall code structures, while for people like me, it provides a different logical grouping approach with the same net result.\n\nTo be clear here, I fullyÂ agree that the current approach is bothÂ confusing and far too limited, and I can absolutelyÂ see the merits of your approach. That said, our discussion here seems to clearly indicate a need to have something that doesn't necessarilyÂ try to be one size fits all...which makes sense really...that's what makes PowerShell so powerful...it's ability to appeal to multiple mind sets by offering multiple approaches to problems.\n",

    "body": "> . An example parameter situation:\r\n> \r\n> The command `Get-Something` has two primary parameters that are mutually exclusive. It also has two supplementary parameters which _may_ be used with either, but not together. Theoretically this results in 6 parameter sets:\r\n> \r\n> ```powershell\r\n> Get-Something -Main1\r\n> Get-Something -Main1 -SubA\r\n> Get-Something -Main1 -SubB\r\n> Get-Something -Main2\r\n> Get-Something -Main2 -SubA\r\n> Get-Something -Main2 -SubB\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n> With the current system, this cannot be expressed at all: Assuming the first path becomes the `DefaultParameterSetName`, the fourth option will automatically lead to an ambiguous parameterset (as all the last three options could still be possible).\r\n\r\nNot quite, \r\n\r\n- main1 is mandatory in sets 1,2 & 3 \r\n- main2 is mandatory in sets 4,5 & 6.  \r\n- subA is mandatory in 2 & 5, \r\n- subB is mandatory in 3 and 6. \r\n\r\nThis causes a complication when things are piped in but it's solvable. \r\n\r\nThat aside there is a lot of sense here. Especially with the problem of multiplication, if every parameter ends up being prefixed with multiple lines saying which set it is in and where it is mandatory the parameters themselves shrink into a sea of other information. Help becomes horrible because each set is listed. \r\n\r\nA way of  saying \"Allow one of these\" without having to double or treble or quadruple the number of sets would solve many , maybe most, problems in one go\r\n\r\n\r\n> I dunno. That kinda feels a bit much like dynamicparam-lite. Part of why I _don't_ like dynamicparam is it's a much less declarative syntax, and it's much harder to tell at a glance what's going on as a result. ðŸ˜•\r\n\r\nDyamic parameters cause at least as many problems as they solve. Having everything relating the parameter with the parameter means even if you can't see at once what is going on, it's in one place.  \r\nBut when you say\r\nParameter A is in Set 1,3, 5 and 7\r\nParameter B is in Set 2,3, 6 and 7\r\nParameter C is in Set 4,5, 6 and 7\r\n\r\nWhat's in any given set isn't obvious (which is what we have now)\r\nIf you say    \r\nSet 1 is A, 2 is B, 3 is A and B, 4 is C, 5 is A and C, 6 is B and C and 7 is A, B and C    \r\nWhat sets B is in needs a long hard look. \r\n\r\n\r\n> Hmm. Still not sold on the groups. `Set` and `Group` seem fairly interchangeable and prone to confusion tbh.\r\n\r\nI think we have this X-Y product thing going on.;  but I'm having a problem visualizing multiple axes.\r\nIn importExcel we have some issues Import-Excel has 6 sets and Set-ExcelRange which applies formatting does use any because of the trouble in trying to support all that would be needed\r\nIt has borderAround, which excludes Borderleft, borderRight etc.  It originally just had switches for [add] bold, italic, underline, strikethru, subscript, superscript \r\nSo you have size, and type face which go in all sets, including the unnamed default\r\nborderaround, and each of the other borders which divide things into two sets;  subscript , superscript (and neither),   So that's six sets. When someone said they wanted remove-border  remove-bold, etc we went for the unconventional -bold:$false because -bold -unbold and neither would allowing -noborder -bold, -borderbottom -Unbold, -borderAround -italic -unStrikethru ... with the appropriate options blocked  means over 100 sets.\r\n\r\nI think @merddyin has got closer to solving this problem, because currently sets serve the need of saying \"These combinations cannot be used together\" by specifying what can.   That's great if the choice is _either_ (A and/or,B and/or C) _or_ (D, and/or E and/or F)   not for (A or B) and/or (C or D) and / or (E or F) \r\n\r\nExpressing the latter needs a new syntax which may need nesting \r\nsomething like \r\n```\r\nparam (\r\n$FontSize. # in all sets\r\n[exclusive]( param([switch]$bold) , \r\n                  param([switch]$notbold) ,\r\n)\r\nexclusive( param([switch]$BorderAround) , \r\n                param([switch]$borderTop, switch]$borderleft, <<etc>> ) \r\n                param([switch]$No Border ) \r\n)\r\n```\r\nwith nesting it can do things like border weight but I don't think the syntax can be called nice.\r\n```\r\nexclusive(   \r\n    param ( \r\n        exclusive( \r\n            param([switch]$BorderAround) , \r\n            param([switch]$borderTop, switch]$borderleft, <<etc>> ) \r\n         )\r\n         param ( $BorderWeight )\r\n    )\r\n   param([switch]$No Border ) \r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n[parameter()] inside these blocks would say if one member is present another is mandatory and also say that NoBold and noBorder come at the end of tab completion so users don't need to tab through on/off for options they don't want to set. \r\n\r\nI don't think there is a single new syntax which will please everyone, and if there is to be change the first thing to do might be to identify the cases which give the most frequent problems in practice  (the above seems is a real problem for _me_, but how common is it?)  there are likely to be cases which can't be done but no-one wants. \r\n\r\nIt's also worth saying that accessing other parameters in **validation** is not easy and two validation attributes could solve the problem \r\n```\r\n [NotWith(Bold)}\r\n[Switch]$NoBold\r\n\r\n[NotWith(NoBorder,BorderLeft,BorderRight<etc>)}\r\n$BorderAround\r\n\r\n[With(BorderAround,BorderLeft,BorderRight<etc>)]\r\n$BorderWeight\r\n```\r\nNote that tab completion would need to look at the with / notWith attributes of parameters, so borderweight only becomes an option if border around or left or right is specified. I can imagine how one says say _some_  border is mandatory - but there are 17 allowable combinations - but I would hope never to see it coded ! \r\n",

Because -gt -match -notlike and all the others can't be used together  each has it's own set - 32 of them! More than a screenful of sets before the help.  add `-Full` and look at the detail under, say, NotMatch and NotLike.  It says BOTH are required ... they are required _in their own mutually exclusive parameter sets_ but the help doesn't give you that info _with the parameter._   \r\nNow imagine that help showing one parameter set and under the parameter in the help it said \"Can't be used with:  -eq -ge -gt ....\"   \r\nExplaining to end users gets _way_ simpler (although where-object is an unusual case) and to programmers who currently have to grasp sets its also simpler. In both cases it does what @vexx32  said above (I think it was) keep everything about the parameter in one place. The information which says -NotLike and -NotMatch are not required _at the same time_  is 500 lines back up the help from the suggestion that they are. \r\n\r\nIt needs more thought, and some more input would certainly be good, as I say, I'm starting to think this is a good solution to a lot of the cases. \r\n\r\n",

At this time, I'm going to withdraw this RFC. The feedback makes it clear that the current proposal doesn't completely solve the problem without introducing new problems in readability. Any RFC for this issue should also (as @KirkMunro [pointed out](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/2#issuecomment-177718730)) include addressing making help more readable as generating many parameter sets makes it much less readable for end users.\r\n\r\nA main point here - **User Experience**\r\n\r\n_Obviously enhancements of existing attributes or introducing new attributes add new complicity and impairs readability and maintainability._\r\n\r\nWe should consider these attributes as implementation details and hide the complicity in PowerShell Engine/compiler. \r\nWhy?\r\nLet's look how we create new cmdlet/adv. function: define the cmdlet name, output type(s), define parameters and their input value validations, then define parameter dependencies. \r\nOnly last is in a scope of the discussion. How do we define parameter dependencies? First, we create a syntax diagram on paper or in the head, then _manually_ transform/\"compile\" the diagram to ValidationSet attributes with some names, and at the end, we run `Get-Command -Syntax` to generate a syntax diagram to check results.\r\n\r\n_So starting and ending points is the same __syntax diagram___. Can anybody propose anything more user-friendly than syntax diagram? We can't think of anything else. (If we look the related issue #13746 there @iRon7 is trying to resolve the problem and he has started with syntax diagram too.)\r\n\r\nThis immediately raises questions:\r\n- why don't we use the diagram right away?\r\n- why do we do this transformation manually if, following simple formal rules, we can entrust it to a computer?\r\n\r\n__Thus the solution to this problem is to prompt the user to create a syntax diagram.__\r\nThis gives us:\r\n- best UX\r\n- great flexibility\r\n- hide complicity in Engine\r\n- full backward compatibility\r\n\r\nRoadmap is:\r\n- Design a notation for the parameter dependencies syntax diagram in a RFC\r\n(we could start with @KirkMunro's proposal mentioned above in the post)\r\n- Create parser/compiler for the notation\r\n(we get very flexible Ast tree )\r\n- Create new attribute to assign the syntax diagram to a cmdlet\r\n(we get great UX)\r\n- Enhance existing attributes (like ParameterSet) and add new ones so that implement parameter dependencies any complicity (which is hided from uses in Engine).\r\n",
