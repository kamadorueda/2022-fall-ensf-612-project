I don't know how long it takes to understand why color schemes in Windows are so carefully chosen.\r\n> \r\n> It is in #16634 too.\r\n \r\n#16634 was a user  thinking PowerShell's `ls` alias would output text like unix ls. So when he sent it to `select-string`, and got a a search through the _contents of all the files_ for the text \"dll\" instead of a search of the _file listing_  (a) It was unexpected and (b) there were some really long \"lines\" :-) \r\n\r\nNot sure if you mean #16618. I thought I posted to that one - maybe I was a bit forthright in my views and someone deleted it.  But that one means out-of-the-box PowerShell can't redirect to a file without getting Ansi-corruption.  `dir > file` has it ,  in the headers  `get-itemproperty` has it on every line. \r\n\r\n```\r\nAuthenticationLevelOverride : \u001b[0m0\r\nPSPath                      : \u001b[0mMicrosoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Terminal Server Client\\\r\nPSParentPath                : \u001b[0mMicrosoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\r\nPSChildName                 : \u001b[0mTerminal Server Client\r\nPSDrive                     : \u001b[0mHKCU\r\nPSProvider                  : \u001b[0mMicrosoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry\r\n```\r\n\r\n>  I don't know how long it takes to understand why color schemes in Windows are so carefully chosen.\r\n\r\nWhat happens is sooner or later some dev or devs look at the monochrome text and think things would be a whole lot better if they were in colours or (heaven help us) flashing, or some such. They colour things in a way they like, but doesn't make any sense to anyone else - take a simple example, the experimental feature in Pwsh to apply colours to file listings says compressed files should be red. Red is usually used for \"Danger\" \"Beware\", \"Not right\", so why mark zips as worrying ? Simply because the guy who did it liked red.   For every person who likes the prettification, there's another who is driven mad by it.  No UI expert is ever involved. No one is able to tell them \"You've made everyone less productive because they're spending more time reading and trying to understand what the visual differences mean\". \r\n\r\n",
