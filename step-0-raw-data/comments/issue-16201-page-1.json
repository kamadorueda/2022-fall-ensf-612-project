This is most likely a question that should be directed to that module as this repo is for PowerShell itself. It may even be a question for Azure Cloud Shell who build the environment to ensure it has set up the DSC components in OMI properly but a quick scan online suggests `Publish-AzVMDscConfiguration` is meant to be run on a Windows host.",
