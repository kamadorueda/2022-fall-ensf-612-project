I think it's fair to say that we cannot implement a fully effective solution without first having a clear description of the problem and how it's impacting what you're attempting to accomplish, would you agree? ðŸ™‚ ",

    "body": "If you're using the PowerShell Core console it supports <kbd>ctrl+v</kbd> for pasting.  Also, newer versions of Windows 10 console (used by both cmd and PowerShell) support paste via <kbd>ctrl+shift+v</kbd> (this might need to be enabled in the console properties).\r\n\r\nssh issues should be posted to https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/issues.  However, I've been using ssh on Windows 10 1803/1809 and it is pretty simple to set ssh-agent to serve your passphrase all the time.  Once you've add the Windows optional feature OpenSSH Client, run this command from an elevated PowerShell console to enable the ssh-agent service:\r\n```\r\nGet-Service ssh-agent | Set-Service -StartupType Automatic -PassThru | Set-Service\r\n```\r\nThen add your private key (supplying your passphrase):\r\n```\r\nssh-add ~\\.ssh\\<private-keyfile-name>\r\n```\r\nIf you want to use ssh: protocol with Git you will need to also let Git know that it should use the Windows built-in version of openssh instead of the version that ships with Git for Windows.  Do that like so:\r\n```\r\ngit config --global core.sshCommand \"C:/WINDOWS/System32/OpenSSH/ssh.exe\"\r\n```",
