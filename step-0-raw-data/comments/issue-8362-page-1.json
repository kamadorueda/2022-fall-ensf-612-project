    "body": "The current behavior is actually by design. `Register-ArgumentCompleter` is for argument completion, not parameter completion. When given `foo.ps1 -pa`, powershell cannot resolve `foo.ps1` (you need to use `.\\foo.ps1` for such a file at the current folder), and thus treat `foo.ps1` as an unknown native command. For a native command, anything following is considered its arguments, that's why the argument completion kicks in for `-pa`. However, when given `.\\foo.ps1 -pa`, powershell knows `.\\foo.ps1` is a powershell command and `-pa<tab>` is an attempt of parameter completion. Therefore, the custom argument completer shouldn't kick in.\r\n\r\nWhen you run `gcm foo.ps1`, you will see the following error and suggestion, because `foo.ps1` cannot be resolved to a command:\r\n```\r\nPS:65> gcm foo.ps1\r\ngcm : The term 'foo.ps1' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ gcm foo.ps1\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (foo.ps1:String) [Get-Command], CommandNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetCommandCommand\r\n\r\nSuggestion [3,General]: The command foo.ps1 was not found, but does exist in the current location. PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: \".\\foo.ps1\". See \"get-help about_Command_Precedence\" for more details.\r\n```",
