    "body": "[`System.Net.Http.HttpResponseMessage.IsSuccessStatusCode` ](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.Net.Http/src/System/Net/Http/HttpResponseMessage.cs#L123) only considers `200`-`299` as success. [`Invoke-WebRequest`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/CoreCLR/WebRequestPSCmdlet.CoreClr.cs#L567) is evaluating that and then generating a terminating error if `IsSuccessStatusCode` is false. I think their definition of \"success code\" is literally the `200` responses. `100`-`299` are \"not errors\". Not all \"not errors\" are \"successes\" but all \"successes\" are \"not errors\".\r\n\r\nI guess in the case of your example, wouldn't a `301` with `-MaximumRedirection 0` technically be a terminating error? I mean, I understand that you are attempting to retrieve where the page is redirecting, but under normal circumstances if you told it not to redirect and it tried to redirect, wouldn't that be an error?",

Was the old behavior considered a bug that is now fixed?\r\n\r\nEither way, action is needed, even if it only means _documenting the change_.\r\nI suppose another option would be for `Invoke-WebRequest` to mask the change.",

But, then, there are a bunch of changes in behavior between 5.1 and 6.0 in the WebRequest cmdlets (like the headers dictionary values now being a `[System.String[]]` instead of just a `[System.String]` and strict request header and user-agent validation is now default). Not sure how or where to document all of those differences.",

What I do have planned for a future version (possibly 6.2.0) is to add the ability to specify what status codes to treat as success. There are many instances where you need check the content of a 404 from a REST API as it contains valuable information in JSON.\r\n\r\nThe 3XX status codes could be treated as success.\r\n\r\nI have some possible designs listed in #6157",

    "body": "I think the default action of throwing a terminating error is bad. For example, I'm writing a module to use with HDFS which happens in a 2 part interaction. The first put request returns a 307, I need to look at that response to get the location header and make sure it was a 307, not something else like a 400 or 500. Then I send a new request with possibly different headers and body content, so I can't just follow the redirection. I need to be able to see the response code from the first request, make sure it was a 307 and then move on. In PS v5, I was able to do this with the -ErrorAction parameter. This should be the same behavior in PS Core.",

    "body": "So, this is a terminating error because, well,, this is a terminating error. When the result is not successful the command terminates and doesn't process further. A non-terminating error only makes sense when the command continues. This is a common pattern (as far as I can tell) with `Invoke` cmdlets. When a response is successful there is more processing done on the response. That's why the command terminating early is properly a terminating error. \r\n\r\nAs for the testing of 300 level response codes (and others), this will be addressed in another manner by allowing users to either treat all status as successful or to supply what response codes should be considered successful. There are plenty of situations where even a 404 needs to be tested.\r\n\r\nFor general use, if a user supplies a `-MaximumRedirection` and the redirects go beyond that count, that is an error and in the case of these cmdlets, a terminating one. Instead of thinking about it from a testing or grabbing location headers perspective, think about it from a normal user's perspective. They are saying \"do not go more than this many hops\" if the last hop in that count is not successful, then they would be expecting an error, not a successful response without what they are looking for. Now the burden is on them to test the status code to see if it was really a successful call or not.",

From this thread as well as https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6157#issuecomment-365796222 there seem to be at least two solutions:\r\n\r\n 1. Provide an option to treat all status as success, like `-TreatsAllStatusAsSuccessful` or `-IgnoreStatusError`.\r\n 2. Provide an option to specify the successful statuses (besides the standard ones like `2xx`?). Note that we may need range here, like `300-399` or `3xx`.\r\n\r\nI would prefer the first one. It’s easy to implement, and we don’t need to discuss whether to allow default successful statuses. User can write their own logic to decide whether status is success.",
