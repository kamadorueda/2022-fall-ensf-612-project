    "body": "I could use some additional eyes on the root cause behind this issue, because what is done in PowerShell right now is off, and I can fix it, but I don't have the history behind it.\r\n\r\nThe code in question is in [debugger.cs, on lines 3227 to 3247](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a34d094b21057299dfd6501b9df897216e947780/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/debugger/debugger.cs#L3227-L3247).\r\n\r\nThat event handler is invoked in response to a breakpoint being updated in the local debugger _or in any nested debugger_. This includes the `PSTaskChildDebugger`, `RemotingJobDebugger`,  `RemoteDebugger`, `ServerRemoteDebugger`, and `NestedRunspaceDebugger`. That's why modifications to breakpoints in a remote runspace (in the example above, in a job) result in breakpoints changing in the local debugger. The local debugger `HandleBreakpointUpdated` event receives details about the breakpoint that was changed _in another runspace_, and then tries to make the same changes in the local debugger.\r\n\r\nThis behavior seems clearly wrong to me, and I'd like to fix it. My initial thought is: that event handler doesn't appear to be needed at all, so remove it. If I create, enable, disable, or remove a breakpoint in a local debugger, the breakpoint is created, enabled, disabled or removed via direct API invocation. If I do the same in a remote debugger, the same happens. Why then do we have an event handler that is notified when a breakpoint is updated in a remote session in PowerShell itself? The only logical reason I could come up with was to synchronize breakpoints across all runspaces, but we don't do that -- we manage breakpoints separately in each runspace.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, @PaulHigin, if you could have a look at this and share your thoughts, it would be appreciated.",
