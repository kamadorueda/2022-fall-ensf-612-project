Really even the constructors should throw.  The point in adding this back is only for assembly load/JIT time backwards compatibility right?  If someone is trying to actually instansiate an instance of `WorkflowInfo`, that should definitely throw as well.

    "body": "We discussed this at length within the @PowerShell/powershell-committee and went back and forth a few times:\r\n\r\nIt's been our philosophy for a long time that we should make a \"best effort\" to load .NET Framework / WinPS compiled modules in .NET/PS Core. E.g. if 9/10 cmdlets in a module would work just fine at runtime, but the 1 cmdlet contains a reference to a missing type, it gives me heartburn that we block import altogether. This is particularly relevant with regards to modules that are not and will not be maintained but that still can have value in (mostly) working with PS7. \r\n\r\nThat being said, we also don't want to start adding these things back on an ad hoc basis. We removed a ton of stuff over the course of 6.x, and we certainly shouldn't re-introduce just this one type if we decide that it's the right thing. The effort level to enumerate, analyze, decide on, and reintroduce all those types would be significant, and may cause other unforeseen problems. Therefore, we'd rather wait until we see this problem more often in the wild--and particularly around modules that are not well maintained--before it makes sense to make that investment. \r\n\r\nAlso, we all agree that we wouldn't ever want to add something like this back to .NET Standard, as we're trying to get as close to of a guarantee of \"it will work on both editions\" as is possible at compile time. Furthermore, if a module is being recompiled, then it means it's being actively maintained, and the usage of that type can be removed.",

    "body": "@joeyaiello I think you made the wrong call on this. I chose to apply the PR because that was something I could do today. Obviously if I could have just fixed this in my modules I would have already, but releasing an update to my modules is not something I can do until I have a new code signing certificate.\r\n\r\n> That being said, we also don't want to start adding these things back on an ad hoc basis. We removed a ton of stuff over the course of 6.x, and we certainly shouldn't re-introduce just this one type if we decide that it's the right thing.\r\n\r\nThis is a new change in PowerShell 7. It was not in PowerShell 6.x. Ergo it isn't re-introducing something, it's just undoing the removal of that thing before PowerShell 7 is released.\r\n\r\n> Therefore, we'd rather wait until we see this problem more often in the wild--and particularly around modules that are not well maintained--before it makes sense to make that investment.\r\n\r\nThis is a specific issue with a problem in the wild, for a change that has not yet been included in anything other than a pre-release. It's also a problem with a module that is used by other modules, so the impact isn't just localized to one thing. I don't see where \"investment\" comes to play here given that this is pre-release. It also appears that you're deciding to handle this differently for me than you would for a customer with shipped modules, assuming I can just do the work to make this right on my side, and that's not right.\r\n\r\n> Furthermore, if a module is being recompiled, then it means it's being actively maintained, and the usage of that type can be removed.\r\n\r\nI only compiled the module again to identify where the issue was coming from. While I want to actively maintain my modules, I am not in a position to code-sign them yet, and as such, they are sitting idle until I can code-sign them again. This is something I hope to be in a position to do again in the next few months, but it is not something I can do today. That doesn't qualify for \"actively maintained\" in my book.",
