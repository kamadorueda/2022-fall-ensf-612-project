I agree with @dlwyatt that `ValueFromRemainingArguments` should be similar to `params` in C#, which means when it gets to the point to call `BindParameter`, the provided argument should always be a collection.\r\n\r\nActually, the changes in this PR cannot guarantee the `RemainingArguments` binding step to always try binding a collection object to the target parameter because of the `IsObjectEnumerable` check. The remaining argument could be a single custom object that happens to implement `IEnumerable` interface, in which case this single object will be used to bind to the target parameter. **I'd love to have a more restricted check that makes sure it's a collection/list**, but as long as we can agree that \"use `ValueFromRemainingArguments` only for array type parameter\" is a guideline/best practice, then we should be good.",

I'm all for adding more errors on inappropriate use of an an attribute.\r\n\r\nOne more random thought - not necessarily a good idea, but the only case that truly needs to be a breaking change if we want an error - if the parameter type is explicitly specified and is not `object` or `PSObject` or an array of anything. For singular `object` or `PSObject`, the cmdlet must handle arrays anyway or it's broken, so there is little risk in always creating an array.  I suspect there is very little code out there that explicitly uses a parameter type constraint that isn't `object`, `PSObject`, or an array with `ValueFromRemainArguments`.",
