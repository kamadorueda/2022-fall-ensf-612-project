    "body": "> Current SMA.dll size is ~20 Mb with R2R (~10% from dir full size) and ~7 Mb without R2R (~3% from dir full size).\r\nI wonder how could we noticeably reduce \"disk footprint\" with the plugin model?\r\n\r\n@iSazonov sorry for the delay of my response. You are talking about the whole pwsh package size. If you have a scenario that require full set of features, then there is no much we can do about the disk footprint. But when you have scenarios that you only need a subset of PowerShell features, there is a chance to reduce the footprint.\r\n\r\nFor example, say an Azure service wants to use PowerShell language for local in-proc processing, then the remoting and job components and their dependencies are just burden. The goal of minimal powershell is to make the engine minimal and pluggable, so you can get only what you need and don't waste additional disk footprint.",

    "body": "> It looks like the Prediction subsystem is still in SMA but one of the goals of subsystems was pulling them out of SMA. Any reason Predictions didn't start outside of SMA?\r\n\r\nThe `CommandPredictor` subsystem is not in SMA. Without a predictor implementation, APIs exposed from `CommandPrediction` do nothing. `CommandPrediction` exposes the interfaces for a user to consume the `CommandPredictor` implementations, if any is registered. So `CommandPrediction` is not the \"_prediction subsystem_\", but just a thin layer between users and the `CommandPredictor` subsystem.\r\n\r\n> Hosting scenarios using the PowerShell SDK - How does a PSHost interact with subsystems?\r\n\r\nSo far, I don't think a PSHost needs to interact with subsystems. When remoting is refactored as a subsystem, it may need to interact with PSHost, but the host doesn't need to know whether it comes from `S.M.A.Core` or a `PowerShell.Subsystem.Remoting.dll`.\r\n\r\n> PowerShell SDK currently pulls in SMA... what\r\n\r\nNot sure what you are asking here.\r\n\r\n> If I am a PowerShell module referencing PowerShell Standard, how could I leverage a subsystem only when I'm running in PS 7.next?\r\n\r\nFor now, you will have to build 2 assemblies for the module, one targeting PS standard, which can be used on prior-7.1 PowerShell; one targeting the 7.1 nuget packages, which is used when the psversion is 7.1. It's in the same situation as the new debugging APIs added in 7.0. They are not in the PowerShell Standard. How are you using them in PSES today?",
