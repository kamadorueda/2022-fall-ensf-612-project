Why would anyone want to block new versions or features in his _own_ code? \r\n I rather expect that users will request to add support to latest Roslyn and C# versions. Currently we have to change the cmdlet to add new version explicitly but if we'll use native Roslyn types we get this automatically. (With .Net Core hosting model even more automatically).\r\n\r\n3. @SteveL-MSFT suggested using dynamic parameters because Roslyn exposes different types for different languages. This allow us to expose exact language version strings in a parameter in any cases. I don't investigate but I guess we could to try emulate current `-Language` behavior if we could give up current `Language` enum type.\r\n",

Therefore, on PSv5.1 these 2 options don't work unless the user manually installs .NET 2 and .NET 3.5. See examples below:\r\n```\r\nPS:2> Add-Type -TypeDefinition $source -Language CSharpVersion2\r\nAdd-Type : Cannot add type due to the following exception: Compiler executable file csc.exe cannot be found.. Verify\r\nthat Microsoft .NET Framework 2  is installed.

As for the other `CSharpVersionN` members, none of them are used anywhere.",

I plan to add new parameter with name like `-WarnAsErrors` - we could add `IgnoreWarnings` as alias. \r\nAlso I plan add support for preprocessor constants. The rest does not look so useful - if you have other considerations please let me know.",
