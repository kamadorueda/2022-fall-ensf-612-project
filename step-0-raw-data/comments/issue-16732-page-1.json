    "body": "> Not sure how I can help here. Is this a WT or pwsh issue?\r\n\r\nYou could call it a WT issue but it's more a conpty thing and it's by design. [microsoft/terminal#8312 (comment)](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/8312#issuecomment-731888271) goes into a bit more detail. Here's the relevant quote:\r\n\r\n> We made a critical mistake approximately forty years ago (😁) and made the entire buffer (120x9001 or whatever the user requests) available to a console application. There's the viewport (120x30) and the buffer (120x9001), both of which the application can control. It can draw outside of its bounds, and it can know exactly where _in the buffer_ it's printing. Pretty cool!\r\n> \r\n> Applications that have some amount of buffer awareness will eventually reach a point where they're on line 9001 and _oops_ the line under 9001 is **also** line 9001 (because the old line 0 got destroyed and shifted off the top of the buffer.) This bit is the crux of your issue 😄. We call it \"circling.\"\r\n> \r\n> Terminals have never supported that viewport/buffer split. They've only ever offered viewport control, and the buffer was an artifact owned by the terminal itself (because, like, it might have been a line printer or a serial device or a modem . . . instead of a terminal emulator application). That puts the terminal in charge of scrollback, and scrollback is stored in a place where the client application can't see (or change) it.\r\n> \r\n> To account for this difference, ConPTY mode restricts the buffer size to _match the viewport size_. This restriction applies _regardless_ of `ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING` (which is a feature of conhost, even without Terminal involved.)\r\n\r\n",
