    "body": "@PatrykMilewski Thanks for taking the time to write up an issue report but I _think_ this is working correctly. \n\nThis statement works:\n    $var = [StaticClass]::staticFunction() # first\nBecause what you are doing is defining a property whose name is \"var\" on the class [StaticClass] whose value is the result of the call.  You can see that by commenting out the next line and do this:\nPS> [StaticClass]::New() |fl *\nvar : \n\nThis line fails:\n   [StaticClass]::staticFunction()        # second\nbecause it is not defining anything in the class.  That is what this error is all about:\n    Missing a property name or method definition.\nBecause you are defining a class - you are limited to defining properties and methods and cannot run arbitrary code.\nIf you replace that line with \"Get-Process\", you will also get an error.\n\nDoes that make sense?\nWhat would have been a better error message/experience?\nAgain - thanks!\n",
