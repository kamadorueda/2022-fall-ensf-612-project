But then if they aren't used, adding the names is unnecessary.  Now what I'd really like is for them to be indexable so I could say `$tuple[0]` instead of `$tuple.Item1`. This would allow you to pass 'arrays' through the pipeline with out having them be shredded. Something like\r\n```powershell\r\n[tuple] (1,2,3,4) | ... shredding goes here ...\r\n```",

I don't think it would be a big deal for most use cases but at scale it could be pretty nasty. As you said it's not a big deal atm, but it's worth having a conversation about since it seems inevitable that there will eventually be a popular library that uses named tuples heavily.\r\n\r\n > I'd really like is for them to be indexable so I could say `$tuple[0]` instead of `$tuple.Item1`.\r\n\r\nGood news! :) I fixed that for tuples (and other cases where an indexer is an explicit interface implementation) about a year ago with #7633.\r\n\r\n> ```powershell\r\n> [tuple] (1,2,3,4) | ... shredding goes here ...\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nNot that though.  But you can do `[tuple]::Create(1, 2, 3, 'four')` or if you want an array `[tuple]::Create.Invoke(@(1, 2, 3, 4))`.  A new conversion path that calls `Create` would be pretty cool though, good idea.\r\n\r\nI'd also love for the deconstruct syntax to work (#7471).",
