It is less intrusive in the previous functionality, so the risk should be lower.\r\nI wonder if you, when you review this, can try to think about if the same things could be accomplished in a smarter way? I'm adding a way to check for the existence of _any_ property in a reasonably efficient way. But in reality, we only use it to check if there exist any property other than our magic remoting note properties. ~~for very _specific_ properties.~~ ~~(The different stream names, and the remoting properties). In the stream case, it is also important which stream it is, but we don't need a PSNoteProperty for that. For example, the 7 boolean flags in PSObject could become bit fields. Maybe we could encode this information there?~~\r\n\r\nI have refactored PSObject to use flags instead of Booleans. I also removed some unused fields, and have plans for using the available padding for speeding up the handling of the remoting properties. I added a field for the stream to use by the formatting system - this was previously magically named PSNoteProperties - and the lookup of these was expensive during formatting.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I've implemented a special case of a the Linq operator `FirstOrDefault`, but I chose not to make this an iterator as I wanted to keep allocations to a minimum. Not sure it's the right call, just trying to explain where I come from :)\r\n\r\nI'm a bit weak on the serialization, so that is an area that could need some scrutiny to see if I've messed anything up.",

The question we need to answer is if there are any properties that should be rendered. The formatting system excludes the remoting properties by default, so we can think of multiple fast paths. For example, we could store a bool per type (somewhere) caching this result, and only do the heavy lifting when needed. Most CLR types has properties, so we could quickly return \"Yes, you have properties to render\". If the cache says false, we may still have attached properties, and need to do the more expensive enumeration, but most core scenarios would be improved.",

Otherwise we force an allocation of the collection on every call.\r\n\r\nThis is especially important in the scenario where the predicated doesn't match any member. That should be an allocation free operation. But with the collection as a return value, it isn't. \r\n\r\nThen consider when the predicate matches a single member. If the caller can reuse the collection, the operation is basically just replacing an item in the collection, instead of creating new, fairly expensive, collections. And this is something that may be done many times for each object in the pipeline. It really adds up.\r\n\r\nYou may have the other version too, but implemented as \r\n```\r\nPSMemberInfoInternalCollection<T> GetMembers<T>(\r\n    object obj, \r\n    MemberNamePredicate predicate ) where T : PSMemberInfo\r\n{\r\n    var res = new PSMemberInfoInternalCollection<T>();\r\n    GetMembers(obj, predicate, res);\r\n    return res;\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe important thing is that there should always be a variant where the caller can be responsible for the allocations.",
