    "body": "There are some oddities about how parts of Get-ChildItem (alias ls) work, most of which are in the filesystem provider rather than the cmdlet. These are compounded when using wildcard characters in file names. \r\n\r\nThere is no obvious reason why ```ls -Path '*\\abc `[defg`].pdf' ``` should not work.  `ls -Path '*\\foo.pdf' ` is fine. \r\n\r\nThe path in  `ls -Path 'abc [[]defg[]].pdf'  seems to read as abc , then one from the set  {\"[\" } , defg , one from the set {\"]\" } , and finally .pdf   which matches.  \r\n `\"abc [defg].txt\" -like 'abc [x[]defg[]x].txt'  `  makes the two sets two-character ones and returns true. So the recursive behaviour is right and it's unclear why the not recursive one does something different \r\n\r\nThe examples where you have ```  ``  ```  are escaping the ```   `  ``` itself, so those are saying a ``` ` ``, then` one from the set {\"d\",\"e\",\"f\",\"g\"} and another ```  `  ``` \r\n",
