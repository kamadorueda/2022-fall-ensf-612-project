    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT: I'd like to get some clarification from the PowerShell Team on how you guys want PRs handled. This PR is done. It's tested and working, and all required changes have been completed. It just needs to be merged. Yet earlier today, @iSazonov added some additional requested changes _that in my opinion add no additional value whatsoever to this PR_.\r\n\r\nSpeaking as someone who is extremely busy, yet makes time to submit PRs when I can, I find this very disrespectful of my time. The casing used in the comment before the added parameter matches the casing used in the comments before the other parameters in the file. Had I decided to change that and use \"Gets\", and at the same time changed the other comments to use \"Gets\" (for consistency), I would very likely have received a comment to undo the unnecessary changes that do not pertain to this PR. And for the \"extra blank line comments\" requests -- why? Who says they are extra? Why is the blank line at the top of the test script block not also considered extra? I can see blank lines considered unnecessary when there are many in a row or when they are used a little too liberally in code, but when we're talking about a single blank line here and there that makes a file more readable, do we really need to nitpick on those details? If so, where are the rules written so that people like me who want to submit PRs can follow them from the onset and not waste time later with these insignificant details? IMHO these requested changes are absurd and have nothing to do with the PR at hand, so I am summarily ignoring them unless someone from the PowerShell team can provide me with a good reason to take time away from what I am otherwise busy doing in order to make these changes. Otherwise, if we can get back to focusing feedback on changes that are actually _required_ for a PR to be approved, it would be appreciated.",

Even the blank line changes? Really? That makes no sense. If I were to waste my time going through PRs and adding comments where I felt blank lines should be removed, does that mean you or someone else from the PowerShell team should create an issue suggesting someone in the community may want to remove those lines at some point? And for the single \"Gets\" comment, wouldn't it be more appropriate to log an issue suggesting that all of the comments where the string starts with lowercase be changed to start with uppercase, and not just one that happened to be entered as part of this PR in a manner consistent with the rest of the file? I don't see any value in #4596 at all -- it feels more like you're passing the time wasting on to someone else, and I feel there is an incorrect judgement being made with respect to what is an appropriate comment to add to a PR and what is not. Saying all comments are welcome is one thing, sure, but for people who are maintainers on a repository, I think the community needs to be able to expect better.",

Then if the person proposing said changes really feels strongly that they should be made, they can take the appropriate steps to try to influence those changes. I wouldn't mind being able to drop in a simple hyperlink in response to any PR change requests that I am not in agreement with. I also think that document should discuss how to propose the right change and how to avoid proposing changes that are inappropriate to avoid all of this in the first place.",
