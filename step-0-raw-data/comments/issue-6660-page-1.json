There was one sporadic test failure (it passed in my branch, which is now even with `master`) and the same test also failed after the PR 6612 of @SteveL-MSFT was merged into master. Unless we are aware of that, we should create an issue for each failure, even if it is sporadic and try to improve the test. From personal experience, sporadic failures can get quickly out of hand if they are not constantly being looked at and can cost a lot of time at the end over time even if they just start as a small nuisance.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9250262/39157059-f394ecb8-4750-11e8-9ab8-8fdecbfc3a87.png)",
