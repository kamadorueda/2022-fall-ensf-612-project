UK, 10AM UTC if run on Paris/Berlin time , 7PM UTC if run in US West coast time.  How do you get noon UTC ? \r\n\r\nAnd BTW \r\n`[datetime]10/11/12`  \r\nuses invariant dates, not local dates. So this is October 11th world wide. \r\n```\r\nfunction test {\r\nparam (    [datetime]$d )\r\n$d \r\n}\r\n\r\n> test 10/11/12\r\n\r\n11 October 2012 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nIt works if you declare a datetime parameter in your own function. \r\n```\r\n>Get-date 10/11/12\r\n\r\n10 November 2012 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nWhat ? Help says it is a [datetime] parameter but in get-date it uses local instead of invariant. \r\n\r\nSorry that I'm pedantic about this stuff.

    "body": "> > What ?\r\n> \r\n> You can set a culture you need at the moment:\r\n\r\nI know @237dmitry  but but some things use invariant culture. \r\n```\r\n Get-Culture\r\n\r\nLCID             Name             DisplayName\r\n----             ----             -----------\r\n2057             en-GB            English (United Kingdom)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm on UK . \r\n```\r\n> [datetime]\"1/12/2021\"\r\n\r\n12 January 2021 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nThat's invariant culture not local (see `[System.Globalization.CultureInfo]::InvariantCulture.DateTimeFormat`)  I might not like invariant being US, but it needs to pick one.  Invariant means my code does the same thing regardless of where I run it.     \r\nBut `-as [datetime]`  does it the other way round. \r\n```\r\n> \"1/12/2021\" -as [datetime]\r\n\r\n01 December 2021 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nIf you know why they're different  you're doing better than I am :-)  \r\n\r\nSo what happens if I put `[datetime]$ParameterName` in a function? \r\n```\r\nfunction test {param ([datetime]$d)  $d}\r\n\r\n> test 1/12/2021\r\n12 January 2021 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nWritten that way I'd expect culture invariant, which is what I get.   \r\nSo let's have a look at Get-Date's parameters : \r\n```\r\n (get-command Get-Date).parameters['Date']\r\n\r\nName            : Date\r\nParameterType   : System.DateTime\r\n```\r\nSo `Get-Date` also declares a `[datetime]` Parameter, so shouldn't that be invariant ? Nope, it uses local culture. \r\n```\r\n> get-date -date 1/12/2021\r\n\r\n01 December 2021 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you use Get-Date on a server where  you don't know what culture and timezone are set \r\n```\r\n> get-date -date 1/12/21 -hour 12 -minute 0 -second 0 \r\n```\r\ncan mean one of three dates, and noon in any time zone. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@iSazonov  \r\nSome of it is definitely [DateTime] . Some is how Get-Date is implemented. \r\n\r\n`Get-Date`   returns the current datetime as local time.  Most people would be surprised if it didn't give the same time as the clock in the system tray. So that's good. \r\n\r\n\r\n`Get-Date -utc `   returns the current time as UTC.  Many people would expect a way to get \"absolute\" or \"zulu\" time this is logical too. \r\n\r\nAfter that the behaviour is just **odd**. I haven't checked the code, but it seems to do this\r\n```\r\n$date = [datetime]::now()    # Current date, local format\r\nif ($year)  {$date.year  = $year}\r\nif ($month) {$date.month = $month}\r\n..etc \r\n```\r\nSo if you give 21 as the year it sets the year 0021, and any parts that are omitted remain set to the current (local) value, and any parts which are provided become local. It seems to end with.\r\n```\r\nif ($asUtc) { $d.ToUniversalTime() } else { $d }  \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis whole question came about because I was fixing someone else's code which split text and passed the results as parameters to `get-date` . Someone more experienced would use `[datetime]::new`  and specify a `DateTimeKind` or one of the parse methods `[datetime]` provides.  I thought Get-Date could be improved but maybe not.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I'm going to close this. @iSazonov  I think there is a \"By Design\" tag you can add. \r\n\r\n1. `Get-Date` always works from _local_ time, using either `[datetime]::now` which is the localize time or the `-Date` or  `-UnixTimeSeconds`  parameter converted to a local `[datetime]`\r\n2.  If `-year`, `-month`, `-day`, `hour`, and/or `-minute`  are given they replace just that value part of the local time.\r\n3. `-AsUTC`  is applied at the end.  So  `Get-Date  -Month 6 -Hour 2 -AsUTC`   keeps year, day, minutes, seconds and fractions of the seconds and changes the month to June (DST in the Northern Hemisphere) and the hour to 2AM and then converts to UTC.  Writing it as  `get-date -asutc  -month 6 -hour 2 ` of course produces the same result, but might suggest to the reader that we have changed the UTC hour. \r\n4. To reliably build a UTC time one should use `[datetime]::new()` and specify the kind as universal. To show the time for a different time zone one should use `[timezoneinfo]ConvertTimeBySystemTimeZoneId`\r\n5. As a compiled cmdlet a `DateTime` parameter passed to Get-Date (`-date`) is converted using local culture settings. PowerShell handles compiled cmdlets and functions differently the conversion for Functions always uses invariant culture. The conversion of some types (including datetime) for compiled code uses local culture. It is a bug but fixing it would break too much existing code. \r\n\r\nI'll take my documentation thoughts for Get-Date to the proper place. \r\n\r\n",
