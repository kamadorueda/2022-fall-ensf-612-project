    "body": "I believe it is because the file is not saved as UTF-8 so right now the left & right pointing double angle quotation mark are in their ASCII value which is `0xAB` and `0xBB`; when read on a system with Chinese as default system locale, the `0xBB` and ending `\"` will be treated as a DBCS character thus causing compiler to fail. If we save the file as UTF-8 they will become `0xC2AB` and `0xC2BB`, which works correctly on any system locales.\n",
