This is a good thing, as notarization is a long-running, asynchronous process. Having to repeat it over and over again for every file in the project would drive me nuts. (That's not even mentioning the automated email that Apple sends whenever a notarization run completes, which becomes quite annoying when I am monitoring it using an automated script!)",

I'll need I very good explanation for this.  If this involves a binary not provided by PowerShell most likely you will need to go back to that binary to get it signed.\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n> Code-sign all *.dylib files with the Developer ID certificate that is used to sign the apphost binary. No other special steps are required here.\r\n\r\nIf the binary is not from Microsoft, and several are, our policy is not not sign the binary.  I'll need a good justification to get an exception to this policy.\r\n\r\nAll of these requirement make building the package long and complicated.  We are having trouble getting notarization support at all.\r\n\r\n",
