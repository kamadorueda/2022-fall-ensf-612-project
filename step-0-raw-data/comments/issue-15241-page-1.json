IMO that more aligns with how most people expect pipelines to work and there's less \"huh I've never seen that before, does it even work\".",

I do agree it's extremely useful, but mostly limited to the *-Item cmdlets. Though I've used with both `Group-Object` & `Sort-Object` often enough, especially in interactive use to quickly get a result without having to formally add a property.  Although those are indeed documented under the about_Calculated_Properties the syntax is quite similar:\r\n\r\n`Get-ChildItem c:\\temp | Group-Object -Property { $_.Extension }`\r\n\r\nI like @rkeithhill approach to focus on examples where reasonably applicable.  I also like @vexx32 idea of additional coverage in advanced function documentation.  There is would be nice to know.  Not to sound cliché but in \"tool making\" we're taught to think about usage scenarios which leads to thought about what and how you can input to the function.",
