My only reservation here is that many module authors won't know that they are actually compatible (or mostly compatible) with macOS or Linux, and I'd rather not _prevent_ users from installing those modules. (E.g. posh-git is 99% working on Mac/Linux)\n\nMaybe we should offer a warning at install time if compatibility isn't explicitly listed? \n\nI also agree we should absolutely give users a way to explicitly filter by Edition. \n",
