Are you expecting it to handle the UTC offset to local time?\r\n\r\nIf so, you're probably better off using `[datetimeoffset]` which is designed to handle UTC offsets. DateTime isn't really meant for handling that, and I'm surprised that ever worked as you expected.\r\n\r\nThat aside, the main issue appears to be that conversion to and from json is resulting in a datetime object rather than the original string... @iSazonov is this something you've seen? Perhaps we should check to see how the newer .NET JSON APIs are handling this kind of case?",
