So ideally you would have:\n\n``` powershell\nget-process | select -top 10\n```\n\nbut is this top 10 by cpu usage, workingset, etc?\n\nNow we would have to include sorting semantics but this breaks the \"do one thing and do it well\" principle unless we can determine significant common use cases to justify it.  For example would we want to support this?\n\n``` powershell\nget-process | select -top 10 -select workingset64 -desc\n```\n\nBut that didn't really save much typing nor improve readability.\n",

I had considered creating new parameter sets for Select-Object for -Top/-Bottom that included sorting, but I couldn't convince myself that baking sorting into Select-Object was the right solution since Select-Object is a pretty well defined atomic command. In the end I decided that as parameter aliases it wasn't so bad, and that if I was going to go the route of actually doing sorting and selecting I might create a different cmdlet instead. I hadn't thought about putting -Top/-Bottom as parameters on Sort-Object though, and I really like that idea -- it makes much more sense in the context of Sort-Object. Is that something you want to run with @lzybkr or do you mind if I have a look?\n",
