In general, a change size of upto `200` lines is ideal for the best PR experience!\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n<details >\r\n    <summary display=\"inline\"> <strong>Quantification details</strong></summary>\r\n    <p />\r\n\r\n```\r\nLabel      : Extra Small\r\nSize       : +26 -1\r\nPercentile : 10.8%\r\n\r\nTotal files changed: 3\r\n\r\nChange summary by file extension:\r\n.cs : +19 -1\r\n.ps1 : +7 -0\r\n```\r\n> Change counts above are quantified counts, based on the [PullRequestQuantifier customizations](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/blob/main/docs/prquantifier-yaml.md).\r\n    \r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary display=\"inline\"> <strong>Why proper sizing of changes matters</strong> </summary>\r\n    <p/>\r\n    <p/>\r\n\r\nOptimal pull request sizes drive a better predictable PR flow as they strike a\r\nbalance between between PR complexity and PR review overhead. PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detetcted.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiZGthdHRhbiIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNzQ2MCIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic1VwIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiZGthdHRhbiIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNzQ2MCIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6Ik5ldXRyYWwifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiZGthdHRhbiIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xNzQ2MCIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic0Rvd24ifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",

Accepting a `ScriptBlock` here will imply the UX of generation based on supplied value, e.g. `$_`. I know your original draft did do something like this and it was changed based on feedback, but the implication will still be there.\r\n2. When this attribute is applied within a module, the `ScriptBlock` invoked will not be invoked in the correct session state. This is already a problem with `ArgumentCompleterAttribute`, but we do not want to add additional features with the same problem until we have a solution.\r\n\r\nWhen the latter issue is resolved, the language WG should revisit the former and determine if there is a feasible design.",

    "body": "@SeeminglyScience I’d be happy to work on the module context issue. \r\n\r\nMy end game is to create a UX similar to Show-Command but for the web. My project (immy.bot) is very tightly integrated with PowerShell with custom PSHosts that push Write-Progress to progress bars in the interface, for example.\r\n\r\nWe already have static forms where you can create parameters for scripts, but it gets rather clunky when the need for parameter sets arise.\r\n\r\nRather than reinvent the dynamic forms wheel, my thought was to simply parse the params block of the script and save parameter values as a hashtable that can splatted on to the script in question and PowerShell can handle the binding.\r\n\r\nObviously this can be done without the feature in the PR, however the primary use case for me does require it, I’ll elaborate.\r\n\r\nMy application installs software on computers based on the user you select. Users are dynamically retrieved from AzureAD. This is currently implemented in C#, but to offer maximum flexibility I’d like to move this logic into PowerShell so users can define their own behavior.\r\n\r\nNow I suppose I could implement dynamic parameters, assuming that works with Show-Command/Get-Command the syntax is just very cumbersome.\r\n\r\nI’d rather keep everything in a scriptblock and simply call Get-AzureADUser.\r\n\r\nANYWAY, if you wouldn’t mind, can you elaborate on the issue with module context?  Is it related to how modules imported using InitialSessionState.ImportPSModuleFromPath are not bound by constrained language mode?",

    "body": "In remoting PowerShell doesn't send scriptblock, it send _text_. Also there is 1-to-1 mapping local to remote runspace.\r\nI think the main problem is how users perceive it. On the one hand they would like to make the script code independent. On the other hand it is always required to run it in some context. PowerShell historically has a solution. For example, a module has its own context. This is what the module concept exists for. It's simple and it's understandable to users. If we allow an exception, there must be an idea behind it that everyone understands. What I mean by that is that the design of the language should change.\r\n\r\nI don't know what else to add. :-)",
