    "body": "I've dug further into this and it appears the problem is a result of setting `OperationTimeout = 0`. libmi only sets its internal socket timeout [if one is specified by the client](https://github.com/Microsoft/omi/blob/b66f6468838c7074c2b3f03eb1344a5958e1aced/Unix/wsman/wsmanclient.c#L719); otherwise it uses its default of one minute. So I think this is still a bug (the PowerShell stack shouldn't hang in this situation), but it's a pretty specific edge case, and can be easily worked around by setting `OperationTimeout` to a non-zero value.",
