    "body": "Thanks Steve. I will remember that for the future.\r\n\r\n-RequiredVersion would suffice. Basically anything that supports getting the exact right version. I actually thought the GUID parameter was to differentiate between two modules of the same version, to support scenarios that require that level of specificity. I suspect many would also come to the same conclusion if all they had to go off off was the parameters and the \"spirit of intent\" implied by the word \"requires\".  But I'm ok if just the documentation gets updated; so long as other folks don' t spend the time I did trying to figure out why it's not working.\r\n",

Specifies a version of the module that this cmdlet imports. If the version is not installed, Import-Module generates an error.\r\n\r\n    By default, Import-Module imports the module without checking the version number.\r\n\r\n    To specify a minimum version, use the MinimumVersion parameter. You can also use the Module and Version parameters of the #Requires keyword to require a specific version of a module in a script.\r\n\r\n    This parameter was introduced in Windows PowerShell 3.0.\r\n\r\n    Scripts that use RequiredVersion to import modules that are included with existing releases of the Windows operating system do not automatically run in future releases of the Windows operating system. This is because Windows PowerShell module version numbers in\r\n    future releases of the Windows operating system are higher than module version numbers in existing releases of the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\n    Required?                    false\r\n    Position?                    named\r\n    Default value                None\r\n    Accept pipeline input?       False\r\n    Accept wildcard characters?  false\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich to me says if the I tell it I only want v1.1, not v1.0 and not v2.0, it will error. My understanding is the -Version is the default parameterset that is used when you execute Import-Module, so that IPMO will always grab the latest version by design.",
