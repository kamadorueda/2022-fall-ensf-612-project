Another engineer had already spent at least 20 minutes wondering why his pipeline didn't work.\r\n\r\nThis looks really bad as a user--Powershell's object-oriented nature should make pipelines like this a breeze, instead you get hard-to-diagnose Heisenbugs (this would have disappeared as soon as someone tried assigning it to a variable, only to reappear again later).",

    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT @joeyaiello \r\n\r\nI'd like clarity on this because it's a common enough issue I hear about with `Invoke-RestMethod` and we should align the behavior of `ConvertFrom-Json` with `Invoke-RestMethod` within the same release if not within the same PR regardless of what is decided (i.e they should always have the same behavior in every release).\r\n\r\nI have code which relies on the JSON arrays not being unrolled. As a simplified demo:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-OneOrMoreJsonArrays {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param ()\r\n    end {\r\n        switch (1..2 | Get-Random) {\r\n            1 { '[1,2]' }\r\n            2 { '[1,2]','[3,4]','[5,6]' }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nfunction Get-ArrayIndexOne {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param (\r\n        [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline)]\r\n        $Collection\r\n    )\r\n    process {\r\n        $Collection[1]\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nGet-OneOrMoreJsonArrays | ConvertFrom-Json | Get-ArrayIndexOne\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Get-OneOrMoreJsonArrays` may return one or more JSON arrays (e.g. `'[1,2]'`, or `'[1,2]', '[3,4]', '[5,6]'`) that are ingested from either a set of files or from an API/Database. So the change to defaulting to unrolling would result in `Get-ArrayIndexOne` receiving 2 objects now instead of 1 for a single array, 6 objects now instead of 3 for the second example, with no way for me to correlate back to which item belongs to which original JSON array. \r\n\r\nThat is just to demonstrate that this is a breaking change and I believe it to be [bucket 1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-1-public-contract) and as such I believe this should not be implemented without a full RFC process.\r\n\r\nHowever, since this has been the observable behavior since addition of `ConvertFrom-Json` and `Invoke-RestMethod`, I would like to suggest that instead of going through an RFC, changing the default behavior, and breaking existing code, I would rather add a `-Enumerate` (name subject to change) switch to both cmdlets. Those seeking this as default behavior could add it to their `$PSDefaultParameterValues`. we could potentially use telemetry to see how often the change is used and see if it justifies switching the default behavior. additionally, we could do a better job of documenting the current behavior and how to use the new parameter.\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to sound dismissive, but those that have voiced their concerns about the current behavior to me personally don't work as regularly with JSON as those who have voiced their desire to maintain the current behavior. It's a somewhat niche group that works heavily with web APIs and JSON that desire this behavior to remain as is and would definitely require it to be available (though `-NoEnumerate` or something). A small group with a lot of code that would break. \r\n\r\nAnyway, since It's still not clear to me how we manage breaking changes in a way that makes sense... I'd like guidance on what to do for this. I agree with everyone that there should be a way to unroll from both cmdlets. I disagree  (with what seems like everyone) that it should be the default behavior, and I certainly disagree that this is something that should be done without RFC. But, I would like to meet in the middle and provide a way to start unrolling now in a way that is not a breaking change through the addition of a new parameter on both cmdlets. but, I also don't want to do that work if someone will just a short time later submit a PR which flops the default behavior.\r\n\r\nIf we add the new parameter and decide to change the default behavior later, we can then add another parameter (`-NoEnumerate`) make the existing parameter hidden (`-Enumerate`). That would be similar to how we changed the `*-Csv` cmdlets.",

I picked this issue not just because it's a nice entry level problem to look at the code base but also because not only have I fallen into this trap, but I also had to help lots of colleagues with the same issue. \r\n\r\nNot only is this behavior completely unintuitive, since it behaves contrary to almost (? I can't think of a single counterexample actually) everything else, it is also as far as I can see nowhere documented.\r\n\r\nAnd not only is the behavior unintuitive, when trying to analyse an issue (which will often involve assigning partial expressions to variables to make it easier to debug), you're likely to unknowingly fix the underlying problem which means you might not even understand the problem at all, just that the problem magically went away after a bit of debugging. \r\n\r\nThe same problem also makes the current solution very fragile, since a simple refactoring will change the observable behavior.",
