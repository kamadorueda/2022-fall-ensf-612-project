We'd also need to special-case `[list]` as a standalone maybe, if we want folks to just be able to get `[list[object]]` or `[list[psobject]]` inferred from  the plain `[list]` though I don't know if that's desirable?\r\n\r\nAlso, is it desirable that this works or just unnecessary?\r\n\r\n```\r\n[list]$a = [list[string]]::new()\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Currently not working.)",
