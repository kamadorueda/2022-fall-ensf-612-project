That said, when `Span` is eventually added to netstandard there are a lot of places in PowerShellEditorServices where this would be useful.\r\n\r\n> Also I think it should be in IScriptExtent which is already public\r\n\r\nWouldn't that be a breaking change for current implementations of `IScriptExtent`?  Not sure how many external implementations are out there, but at the very least PowerShellEditorServices and EditorServicesCommandSuite both have at least one.\r\n\r\n> I suggest AsSpan().\r\n\r\n`AsSpan` is already used a lot as extension methods in instances where a cast would normally work.  This is most often used targeting netstandard because the nuget package doesn't include the implicit operators for types like `string` and `T[]`.\r\n\r\nI think `AsSpan` would imply you are getting the extent itself as a span instead of just the string it represents.  I guess `GetSpan` has a similar problem though now that I think about it.  Maybe `GetTextSpan` would be better?",

    "body": "I still think there is value in the original proposal.  Ultimately @lzybkr's suggestion is better long term, but I think it's a deceptively large undertaking.\r\n\r\nI'll include a rough outline of how I picture the changes below, but before that a few things to consider.\r\n\r\n1. Every AST type would need new public constructors to handle the alternate way of providing extent information.\r\n\r\n1. Tokens would also likely new constructors (though there are no public constructors currently)\r\n\r\n1. A significant amount of logic in the parser (and at least some in the compiler) would need to be updated.\r\n\r\nI've always wanted to see a separate parser package focused on supporting editors and other related tools.  In something like that I think this change would be great because you could throw out `IScriptExtent` entirely.  I could be missing an easy solution (@lzybkr?) but it looks like the amount of work would not likely be worth the performance gain.\r\n\r\nHere's my idea of how it could be done, ignoring thread safety and error checking:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// Public version of PositionHelper that is easier to use and create, and stores script text\r\n// as ReadOnlyMemory<char>.\r\npublic class ScriptDocumentInfo\r\n{\r\n    private PositionHelper _positionHelper;\r\n\r\n    public ScriptDocumentInfo(string file, ReadOnlyMemory<char> scriptText, int[] lineStartMap)\r\n    {\r\n        File = file;\r\n        ScriptText = scriptText;\r\n        LineStartMap = lineStartMap;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ReadOnlyMemory<char> ScriptText { get; }\r\n\r\n    public int[] LineStartMap { get; }\r\n\r\n    public string File { get; }\r\n\r\n    // This could possibly be omitted and instead use a new IScriptExtent implementation\r\n    // that would utilize ScriptDocumentInfo instead of PositionHelper.\r\n    internal PositionHelper PositionHelper => _positionHelper ?? _positionHelper = CreatePositionHelper(this);\r\n\r\n    public static ScriptDocumentInfo Create(string file, ReadOnlyMemory<char> input)\r\n    {\r\n        // Line map creation from Tokenizer.Initialize method.\r\n        List<int> lineStartMap = new List<int>(100) { 0 };\r\n        for (int i = 0; i < input.Length; ++i)\r\n        {\r\n            char c = input[i];\r\n\r\n            if (c == '\\r')\r\n            {\r\n                if ((i + 1) < input.Length && input[i + 1] == '\\n')\r\n                {\r\n                    i += 1;\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                lineStartMap.Add(i + 1);\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (c == '\\n')\r\n            {\r\n                lineStartMap.Add(i + 1);\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        return new ScriptDocumentInfo(file, input, lineStartMap.ToArray());\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    private static PositionHelper CreatePositionHelper(ScriptDocumentInfo document)\r\n    {\r\n        var helper = new PositionHelper(document.File, document.ScriptText.ToString());\r\n        helper.LineStartMap = document.LineStartMap;\r\n        return helper;\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// Every AST would need new constructors that will take either ScriptSpan or\r\n// both ScriptSpan and ScriptDocumentInfo (for top level ASTs)\r\npublic partial class Ast\r\n{\r\n    private IScriptExtent _scriptExtent;\r\n\r\n    private ScriptDocumentInfo _document;\r\n\r\n    protected Ast(ScriptSpan scriptSpan)\r\n    {\r\n        ScriptSpan = scriptSpan;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    protected Ast(ScriptDocumentInfo document, ScriptSpan scriptSpan)\r\n    {\r\n        _document = document;\r\n        ScriptSpan = scriptSpan;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Original extent based constructor should still populate ScriptSpan and Document.\r\n    protected Ast(IScriptExtent extent)\r\n    {\r\n        _scriptExtent = extent;\r\n        _document = ScriptDocumentInfo.Create(\r\n            extent.File,\r\n            extent.Position.GetFullScript());\r\n        ScriptSpan = new ScriptSpan(extent.StartOffset, extent.EndOffset);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ScriptSpan ScriptSpan { get; }\r\n\r\n    // Lazily create IScriptExtent from ScriptSpan.\r\n    public IScriptExtent Extent => _scriptExtent ?? _scriptExtent = ScriptSpan.ToScriptExtent(Document);\r\n\r\n    public ScriptDocumentInfo Document\r\n    {\r\n        get\r\n        {\r\n            if (_document != null)\r\n            {\r\n                return _document;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            // Get document from a parent if it's not present on this node.\r\n            for (Ast node = Parent; node != null; node = node.Parent)\r\n            {\r\n                if (node._document != null)\r\n                {\r\n                    return _document = node._document;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// I used the name ScriptSpan as sort of a reference to Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Text.TextSpan but\r\n// System.Span makes that a little confusing.\r\npublic readonly struct ScriptSpan\r\n{\r\n    public readonly int StartOffset;\r\n\r\n    public readonly int EndOffset;\r\n\r\n    public ScriptSpan(int startOffset, int endOffset)\r\n    {\r\n        StartOffset = startOffset;\r\n        EndOffset = endOffset;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // DocumentInfo must be provided when context is needed to keep the struct size small.\r\n    public IScriptExtent ToScriptExtent(ScriptDocumentInfo documentInfo)\r\n    {\r\n        return new InternalScriptExtent(\r\n            documentInfo.PositionHelper,\r\n            StartOffset,\r\n            EndOffset);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public ReadOnlySpan<char> GetTextSpan(ScriptDocumentInfo documentInfo)\r\n    {\r\n        return documentInfo.ScriptText.Span.Slice(StartOffset, EndOffset);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "> Is this issue still seeking for adding a new property to `IScriptExtent`?\r\n\r\nIt is to add a new interface with the `GetTextSpan` method (or whatever name is decided, but that is my vote).  I believe it should be on a new interface to avoid breaking `IScriptExtent` implementations that target PowerShell Standard.\r\n\r\n> Or, has the goal been changed to pursue a more fundamental change?\r\n\r\nI think the changes @lzybkr brought up are ultimately the right move at some point in the future.  They do however come with a significant amount of risk and effort as `IScriptExtent` is used heavily in the parser.  For those changes to be meaningful at all, that logic would all need to be changed to use the new API. It's also difficult (for me at least) to tell how exactly large of a benefit those changes would really be.  In other words I think it's the right move but I can't commit that much spare time to it.\r\n\r\n> But I'm afraid it might cause you problems when the editor service code that take advantage the new member is running on an older version of pwsh (or maybe that won't happen?).\r\n\r\nYeah I did some tests with `MetadataBuilder`. Both core and full CLR currently throw on type gen if it comes cross an interface member with a concrete implementation.",
