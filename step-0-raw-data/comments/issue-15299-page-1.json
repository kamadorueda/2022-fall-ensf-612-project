    "body": "there's a few things going on here: we create a fair number of files (command cache, for one, which we want to remain after the process is gone). It's possible to disable telemetry, but that's only one file. Some of these things are artifacts of the way we enable debugging. Usually, these files aren't really a problem, but in some edge cases they may be. I would suggest that the appropriate way to proceed is to launch something like\r\n`mkdir /tmp/t; HOME=/tmp/t TMPDIR=/tmp/t pwsh; rm -rf /tmp/t`\r\n\r\nI thought this was instructive:\r\n```\r\n# TMPDIR=/dev/null pwsh\r\nFailed to create CoreCLR, HRESULT: 0x80004005\r\n\r\n# HOME=/dev/null pwsh\r\nProcess terminated.

Here we can see that the CLR is up and clearly running our code. The engine attempts to create a directory for config data in the users home (CorePsPlatform.cs lines 321, 346, and elsewhere) which will obviously fail in my case. We _could_ possibly be a bit more robust in this case. However, because we use the home location for things like command cache, _not_ having it is going to result in some problematic performance (just a gut response). However, I'm going to assert that setting `TMPDIR=/dev/null` produces a much _more_ dramatic result - it looks like the CLR fiddles about and if it can't do what it needs, it just falls over. I don't think we get as far as executing any of our code.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I think this is probably an issue best addressed by documentation.",
