Your interface DSL actually inspired me, both in how rich it was and since it means interfaces could be made definable in PowerShell without necessarily adding them as a universal language feature. With that said, more complicated things like inheritance might not be so straightforward and would probably need to be part of the parser.\r\n\r\nThere's a discussion of some of the class-specific stuff in #6418 as well.\r\n\r\nBut for settling on the syntax and general design, the best place to start might be with an [RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/powershell-rfc/blob/master/RFC0000-RFC-Process.md), just to drive discussion on how interfaces should look and what features should be supported in PowerShell. Especially so that the PowerShell Committee can consider it.",
