    "body": "We had a number of discussions back in the V3 time frame around whether the `finally` block should run if `.Stop()` was called or not. Some people felt that `.Stop()` should stop all execution including `finally` blocks since a `finally` block could run for some time and how would you stop that. But in the end, we decided that `finally` blocks should run after `Stop()` because the canonical use-case for `finally` is to clean up after the code in the `try` block. So it's by design that in-scope `finally` blocks run after `.Stop()`.",
