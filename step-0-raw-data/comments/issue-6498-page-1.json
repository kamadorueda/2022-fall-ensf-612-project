There were a couple that were parameters in a method call that was itself a parameter to `ReportError`, so I've pulled out the whole expression and assigned it to a variable, which hopefully improves clarity without polluting the namespace too much. Also did the `out` variable thing -- much better than Tuples as you say.",

Just on the basis that I started touching strings in `MshSnapInCmdletResources.resx` and `ParameterBinderStrings.resx` which were rightly owned by those resource files.\r\n\r\nInstead, I'm going to write a lookup method and wrap it in a `[System.Diagnostics.Conditional(\"DEBUG\")]` attribute (and possibly an `\"ASSERTIONS_TRACE\"` one as well?) and use that in a `Diagnostics.Assert()` call. There's concern that we're not building debug builds to catch assertion failures often enough, but I imagine the answer to that problem isn't to stop writing assertions.\r\n\r\nHopefully this is the right way to go.",
