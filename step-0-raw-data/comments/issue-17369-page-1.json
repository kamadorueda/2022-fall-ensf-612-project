Then there is also 2) the bundled/verified/slower-updating Windows Update.\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell extension in VS Code doesn't actually check to see which version is installed, but just whether the PowerShell team has released an updated version - whether it is available or not.\r\n\r\nI'm not clear how to switch from option 2) to option 1). I uninstalled PowerShell from Windows Settings/Programs & Features & then went to the Windows Store and installed the PowerShell Preview. But then there are a lot of detailed settings for VS Code/the extension that overwhelmed me: which of the 20 subtly different settings is the right one? tl;dr\r\n\r\nNow I'm getting a notice that there is a new pscore6 available: apparently the store install didn't install that??? \r\n\r\n",
