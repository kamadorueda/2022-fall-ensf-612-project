This is not correct usage and often breaks autoloading for modules.\r\nIf possible, you have to contact the module author to request a fix.\r\n\r\nThe workaround is to import the module explicitly after installing it.\r\n```PowerShell\r\nInstall-Module -Name CredentialManager -AcceptLicense -AllowClobber -Force -Verbose -Scope CurrentUser\r\nImport-Module -Name CredentialManager\r\nGet-StoredCredential\r\n```\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"/favicon.ico\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/CredentialManager/2.0/Content/CredentialManager.psd1\">PowerShell Gallery\r\n        | CredentialManager.psd1 2.0</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
