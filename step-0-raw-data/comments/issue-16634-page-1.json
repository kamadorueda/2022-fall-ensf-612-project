    "body": "> @jhoneill if you allow me one final question? How can I know the return type of a command (wether it is a lsit of files or a string, for example)?\r\n\r\nSure. \r\nPowerShell commands generally don't print strings, they return objects, and PowerShell has some rules for how to convert them for display.  The `Get-Member` command (alias gm) shows you the type name and the properties and methods available so  `ls | gm` shows you `System.IO.FileInfo` and/or `System.IO.DirectoryInfo` \r\n\r\nIf you do `Get-FormatData System.IO.FileInfo` it shows you the info for displaying files and directories.  ` (Get-FormatData System.IO.FileInfo).FormatViewDefinition` shows there are two table views (the first one is the default view) and there is a list and a wide format view\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                 Control\r\n----                 -------\r\nchildren             System.Management.Automation.TableControl\r\nchildrenWithHardlink System.Management.Automation.TableControl\r\nchildren             System.Management.Automation.ListControl\r\nchildren             System.Management.Automation.WideControl\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can drill into it like this `(Get-FormatData System.IO.FileInfo).FormatViewDefinition[0].control.rows.columns` \r\nand see how the columns are selected. It means you can do stuff with the results of a cmdlet without having to parse text, and if you don't like the display style, you can replace it with your own format data. \r\n",
