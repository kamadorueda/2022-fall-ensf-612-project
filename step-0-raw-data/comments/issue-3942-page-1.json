I have 2 unbaked thoughts:\r\n1. We have more and more build steps gradually, such as embedding icon resources, fixing symbolic links, download additional modules and etc. If we move all to `csproj`, it will become another huge complex `build.psm1`. So I think we need to understand what the goal is, and only move those steps to `csproj` to support the goal.\r\n2. If we move some steps to `.csproj`, then we need to make sure those steps run only once when building all powershell assemblies. If I remember correctly, the target `GetPSCoreVersionFromGit` runs for building every powershell assembly. It's OK to do some duplicate 'git describe' and regex matching, but for a build task like `resgen`, it would be too expensive.\r\n\r\n/cc @PowerShell/powershell-maintainers ",

Currently if you change one resx file all resx files should be regenerated manually and _all_ cs files will be re-compiled. With csproj we check if any resx file changed and only the _single_ changed file will be re-compliled.\r\nFor TypeGen the same - we could re-generate \"powershell.inc\" only if json files changed by `dotnet restore` or the file is missing. \r\nI have no idea how we can build on VS 2015 without these things.",
