    "body": "Based on the `$PSVersionTable` this is running on a macOS host which is surprising to me as I didn't know you could do that with AWS Lambda (I know very little about it really). The `mi` library shipped with PowerShell on macOS has it's own unique problems compared to the Linux distributions. It is dynamically linked to OpenSSL 1.0.x at `/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libssl.1.0.0.dylib` and `/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib/libcrypto.1.0.0.dylib`. To get the builtin version running on macOS you need to install a copy of OpenSSL 1.0.x (1.1.x won't work) and make sure those dylibs are in those locations. If you can run this on a Linux host it will be easier to set up as some distros still package that OpenSSL version and it should just work out of the box.\r\n\r\nThe alternative is to use a fork of `mi` and `psrpclient` that I maintain https://github.com/jborean93/omi. This fixes a few problems with the builtin copy of `mi` in particular for this use case\r\n\r\n* Links to OpenSSL 1.1.x\r\n  * Uses newer and stronger cryptographic features not available in 1.0.0x\r\n  * Easier to install on hosts like macOS where OpenSSL 1.0.x is no longer available in the default repositories\r\n  * Still supported and continues to have security fixes released by OpenSSL\r\n* Enables HTTPS certificate verification\r\n  * Version included by PowerShell does not validate the CA or CN of the HTTPS endpoint\r\n* Increases the password length to support larger JWT tokens\r\n  * This is important for modern auth as I've encountered tokens that exceed the arbitrary password limit set in the builtin `mi` library shipped by PowerShell\r\n\r\nI am in no way affiliated with Microsoft or the PowerShell team so there is no support guaranteed if things go wrong. I try my best to help people who post issues on my forked repo but I can't gurantee a turnaround time or that I will fix the problem. If you wish to use this fork you will have to install it like this (run as root)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInstall-Module -Name PSWSMan -Scope AllUsers\r\nInstall-WSMan\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce installed you can close and reopen PowerShell for the new library to be in place and picked up by PowerShell.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8462645?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/jborean93/omi\">jborean93/omi</a></strong></div><div>Open Management Infrastructure.
