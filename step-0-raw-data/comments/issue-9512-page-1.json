(link in original post)\r\n\r\nMy issue here is that the actions of the completions provide confusion to the user.  This is more common in VS Code (or other editors) than on the command line, where the completer is more likely to be tripped accidentally.  I suspect this was partially the goal of the type accelerations, as it improved the interactive experience with the short-hand types, and gave data to a completion engine at the same time.",

Typically when command completion is triggered for an attribute, it's not actually an `AttributeAst` yet.  Until that `()` is typed, it's a `TypeExpressionAst` or a `TypeConstraintAst`.  Both of those do very different things and resolving all attributes without their suffix could lead to a lot of confusing scenarios.\r\n\r\nSame thing applies to `ordered`.  It's only valid in a `ConvertExpressionAst`, but most of the time it's impossible to tell that you want that until you've typed the rest of the expression.
