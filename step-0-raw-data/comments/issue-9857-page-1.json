    "body": "@travislagrone Reading between the lines, you appear to be asserting that we should add 'np' as an alias for New-ItemProperty - correct? Now aliases are for interactive use, in theory to act as accelerators to facillitate interactive operations. In practise I suspect that in fact New-ItemProperty is not used enough to warrant acceleration (please tell me if i am wrong.) so there's not much justification to do this. Also, it would be a breaking change since it adding it would hid existing \"np\" commands. Thoughts?",

    "body": "@BrucePay From my perspective, _none_ of the `*-ItemProperty` cmdlets are used enough by enough people to warrant a built-in pre-defined alias. If I had my preference, I'd remove all of their aliases from \"language-native\" status.\r\n\r\nThat being said, if PowerShell is choosing to / has already _de facto_ committed to aliasing the `*-ItemProperty` cmdlets, then it should provide consistency in that regard.  Otherwise, the implicit expectation of \"ItemProperty cmdlet aliases are a language-native feature\" that is built up by the presence of literally all of them except one is violated in a somewhat jarring (albeit minor) way when encountered during interactive work.\r\n\r\nAll that being said, this issue appears to me more like an accidental oversight given the intention to alias them all, rather than a mediated decision that `New-ItemProperty` in particular is fundamentally less deserving of an alias then every other `*-ItemProperty` cmdlet (whatever \"deserving\" was defined as by the original creator(s)).\r\n\r\nAm I characterizing the genesis of this inconsistency fairly?  And either way, is it actually feasible to \"demote\" (so to speak) the `*-ItemProperty` cmdlet aliases from \"language-native\" status?",

I don't remember us making a conscious decision to exclude New-ItemProperty (@khansen00 might remember more) so it's probably an oversight. However even though you shouldn't use aliases in scripts, people do so removing the existing aliases would be a breaking change. Adding a new alias would also be a breaking change because people might have their own \"np\" command. Yes we were overly enthusiastic adding aliases in the beginning. Clearly not everything needs an alias but it was our \"defence against verbosity\" argument. The core scenario for the ItemProperty commands is the registry which has both items and values (properties). ",
