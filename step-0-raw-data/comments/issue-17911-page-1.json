    "body": "WG-Engine discussed this and the related issue #11297 yesterday.\r\n\r\nWe agree that is is somewhat buggy and inconsistent behaviour that `$a += $b` does not behave the same as `$a = $a + $b` in some circumstances. However, given this was a change made in PowerShell v3 and has remained the same way in the years since, we do not think this level of a breaking change can be accepted. \r\n\r\nRather, we should look to update our documentation so that users are as aware as possible that this discrepancy exists and know the right ways to work around it when they need to do so.\r\n\r\n@sdwheeler I am unsure which document this information should go into, but we need to capture and possibly expand on the notes linked in #11297 - https://github.com/nightroman/PowerShellTraps/tree/main/Basic/Compound-assignment-operators.\r\n\r\nCurrently it seems as though the only place this is documented is the WMF v3 release notes, so we need to call this out in (I guess?) our operator documentation. I believe this affects all compound assignment operators (`+=`, `*=`, `-=`, and `/=`) as well.\r\n\r\nHowever, for these issues specifically we determined that there is not going to be an opportunity to change the behaviour, and that doing so is extremely non-trivial due to the nature of how and why the change was introduced. As such, we will be marking these issues as Won't Fix.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/c296e9980cdddb00fd77033475cc362dfeaca238e2cd65b122ba06455fb038e6/nightroman/PowerShellTraps\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/nightroman/PowerShellTraps\">PowerShellTraps/Basic/Compound-assignment-operators at main · nightroman/PowerShellTraps</a></strong></div><div>Collection of PowerShell traps and oddities.
