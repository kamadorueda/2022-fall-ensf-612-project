    "body": "> this works in gnu land because single hyphen parameters are guaranteed to be one letter in length\r\n\r\nI'm not sure such things are more than just conventional between commands (the convention existing because of a shared dependency on `getopt`) and I can think of a few counter examples:\r\n\r\n- `ls -al`\r\n- `rm -rf`\r\n- `tar -xvf`\r\n- `xclip -selection c`\r\n- `find -printf`\r\n\r\n> In powershell, we don't have that safety\r\n\r\nI would contend that PowerShell's cmdlets have their parameter syntax much more rigorously enforced.\r\n\r\nBut to the point of shadowing parameters and unpredictability, I've seen that raised in other scenarios but my feeling is that PowerShell, as a shell and scripting language, embraces dynamism. There are plenty of things you can do today that are state driven and could be classed as unpredictable. Certainly a huge number of core PowerShell behaviours are things that can't be promised before runtime (working on PowerShell Editor Services and PSScriptAnalyzer has bourne this out for me). If it's possible to override a command (`function Remove-Item { param($Path) Write-Host \"Didn't remove $Path\" }`), then I think we need better reasons why it shouldn't be possible for parameters.\r\n\r\nThe heart of this proposal is I think to find a PowerShell way to express a `sh` alias like `alias ll='ls -l'` or a way to condense common parameter combinations for muscle memory purposes, and splatting doesn't accomplish that because it's not pithy enough and relies on local state.\r\n",
