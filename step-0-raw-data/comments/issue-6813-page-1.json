Not because it crashes during loading of my module, but because PowerShell should not Crash when loading a module which loads fine in previous releases.\r\n\r\nI checked the Changelog and found that PR #6523 did extensive changes to the Module loading code. Maybe some behavior changed causing the crashes here.\r\n\r\nAs suggested I manually loaded the Module from file and discovered, that 6.1.0-preview.2 imports the `.psm1` file without issues, but when importing the `.psd1` module manifest, the Exception is thrown.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if someone with a working Debugging environment could check the following steps which should reproduce the issue and share the findings:\r\n\r\n1. Download the Module from https://github.com/ffeldhaus/OnCommand-Insight/releases/download/4.2.2/OnCommand-Insight.zip\r\n2. Unzip OnCommand-Insight.zip\r\n3. `Import-Module ./OnCommand-Insight.psd1`\r\n\r\nEDIT: I noted that the Module Manifest contains german comments with non ASCII characters like ä,ö,ü, maybe some code changes do not properly handle non ASCII characters in the Module Manifest",

Maybe some behavior changed causing the crashes here.\r\nAs suggested I manually loaded the Module from file and discovered, that 6.1.0-preview.2 imports the .psm1 file without issues, but when importing the .psd1 module manifest, the Exception is thrown.\r\n",

This is a regression introduced from #6523,  in [`PSModuleInfo.cs`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6523/files#diff-9bbf82b18c0321d75bdb0e7693a44040L582). A circular nested module check was removed because the comment there suggested it happens only with a deprecated workflow module. This causes a `StackOverflow` exception when running into circular nested modules.\r\n\r\nAs @iSazonov pointed out, your module manifest is not well structured. The `RootModule` shouldn't be put in the `NestedModules` again, though that shouldn't make powershell crash.",
