    "body": "@theJasonHelmick I think you misunderstand. This is about _tab completion_, not runtime errors.\r\n\r\nIf you have a module like Exchange (or, really, anything else) that happens to not be installed on the machine that you are currently writing code on, you don't get very basic usability.\r\n\r\nLike a tab completion for scripts. If I have a script I'm writing code around and can't tab complete any of the parameters because a module isn't presently loaded, PowerShell is _actively_ hampering DevX features. The module being loaded doesn't truly matter until runtime, which is when that error will actually show up. \r\n\r\nMy suggestion is mainly that requirements for parsing specifically for dev-time features like tab completion can be relaxed around some uses of `#Requires`. Currently, because PowerShell adamantly refuses to parse the script, editor tooling is effectively rendered mostly useless. A better solution might be to have two parsing modes; one that is strict and used when the intention is to then run the script, and one that is a little more lax and mainly used for tab completion suggestions and other dev time concerns where running the script isn't a priority.",

I would imagine an additional overload / optional parameter be added to the parsing methods on the Parser class which can skip some checks of this nature when parsing. Editor tooling, tab completion, and similar scenarios can use the newer overload for parsing methods instead of the typical parsing method to allow tab completion, command discovery, help information, etc. to be used.\r\n\r\nThen, when a script actually needs to be run in PowerShell, the code paths in that case would continue to use the existing methods which hard-stop at unsatisfied #Requires statements.\r\n\r\nThere is possibly an edge case where someone deliberately tries to use an AST compiled from this new overload to invoke the code; perhaps we could return some kind of non-invokable AST (where `GetScriptBlock()` from the AST just throws instead of returning a scriptblock) from the new method to avoid those cases.\r\n\r\nIMO things like command discovery, help discovery, and tab completion don't need the safety checks that #Requires promises in the same capacity that the parser uses for scripts that are intended to be invoked.",
