    "body": "This is more than likely to be an issue with OpenSSL issues. The version that of OMI that pwsh ships with is dynamically linked to OpenSSL 1.0.2. There is a symbolic link inside the `pwsh` dir that points to your OpenSSL library location but on most modern distributions this is pointing to OpenSSL 1.1.x. Because of the ABI incompatibilities between OpenSSL 1.0.2 and 1.1.x the hack that's in place fails when it tries to use a symbol that it expects to be there [SSL_library_init](https://www.openssl.org/docs/manmaster/man3/SSL_library_init.html). According to the docs this was deprecated in 1.1.x which according to the docs was deprecated in 1.1.0 and more than likely was removed in your version causing the error\r\n\r\n> The SSL_library_init() and OpenSSL_add_ssl_algorithms() functions were deprecated in OpenSSL 1.1.0 by OPENSSL_init_ssl().\r\n\r\nTo continue using the builtin version with pwsh you essentially need to install OpenSSL 1.0.2 and change the symlinks to point to that old version but this is a horrible thing to do. I would also suggest my [PSWSMan](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWSMan/) module. This module is a fork of the code that `pwsh` includes that not only adds support for OpenSSL 1.1.x but fixes [a whole bunch of other issues](https://github.com/jborean93/omi#changes-from-upstream-omi). Keep in mind this fork is not affiliated with MS in any way and there is no guarantee of support. I try my best to help where I can but even then some things are beyond my abilities.",
