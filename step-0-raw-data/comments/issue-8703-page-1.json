Regardless of where it is fixed, what would be a viable work around for someone running into this issue.\r\n\r\nI've searched quite a bit on the web and the threads related to this are right on the nose in terms of problems, but there are no solutions.\r\n\r\nIn my `psd1` file, if I specify `RequiredModules = @('Az')` I run into the issue.\r\n\r\nI do not want to specify each `Az` individual model as I am building against all of it and the expectation is that someone will have this installed locally.\r\n\r\nWhat options do I have to specify the required modules? Is there a wild card that I can specify that will separate it from the `Cyrillic/Azerbaijan` locale that it is hitting?\r\n\r\nMaybe even a alias for the `Az` modules that allows me to specify all of the `Az` modules.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help and support.",
