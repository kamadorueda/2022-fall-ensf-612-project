    "body": "When I did the PR #5774 for this feature of the referenced issue #5012 , this got already discussed, see those 2 items for details.\r\nThe main reason for having the submenu is the  limitation of Windows registry options for context menus: they only allow direct elevation of the process using sub menus.\r\nApart from that the entry name would also become very long since it also needs to include version and bitness due to side-by-side installations to disambiguate.\r\nThe installer option is only setting some registry keys. If you do not like it, you can set your own registry keys for your preferred context menu, there are plenty of blogs on the Internet how to do that.\r\nTherefore I would rather close this issue since there isn't really a viable alternative that a substantial amount of users would find useful. Sure, you could add another checkbox to the installer that only gives you one menu entry without a submenu but then the installer UI gets more complex (often leading to most users being overloaded by too much choice). What are your thoughts @SteveL-MSFT on whether we should provide more customisation?",

As per my previous answer the main point of using submenus is due to the technical limitation of not being able to offer an elevated option in the main menu, hence why the menu options cannot be flat.\r\nAlso please consider that this feature should be a best fit for the majority of users and not just your case, you only describe a very minor inconvenience in your special case.",
