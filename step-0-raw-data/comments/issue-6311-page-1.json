    "body": "Hi @hmmwhatsthisdo, this is a consequence of how the remoting protocol/CliXML was designed. Properties and methods are not transported over the protocol. Methods are ignored and properties (including code properties) are evaluated during serialization with the resulting data value attached to the serialized object as a data member (field). You can find more information about the remoting protocol at [MS-PSRP](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd357801.aspx)",
