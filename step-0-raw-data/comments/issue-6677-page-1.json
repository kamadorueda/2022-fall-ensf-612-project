    "body": ">...but @alx9r's tests were considerably more complicated. I think it would be good to rewrite them to some extent and include them in this PR (the only problem being that they are a bit too self-referential for me to pick apart currently).\r\n\r\nIIRC, that test code emerged organically when I was prospecting for a repro of unexpectedly stale modules.  I apologize it's not more readable.  \r\n\r\nWhat would be important to me (as a PowerShell user) is that there be regression tests in place for the full matrix of relevant permutations.  I _think_ all of the following are relevant for testing module reloading:\r\n\r\n| Thing I _think_ is Relevant | Important Test Cases (cases are semi-colon separated) | Notes |\r\n|----------------------|------------------------|--------|\r\n| class or not | module contains PowerShell class; module does not contain PowerShell class |\r\n| module dot-sources or not | module is a single `.psm1`; module is a `.psm1` file that dot-sources  `.ps1` files |  (1) |\r\n| nested module import location | `Import-Module` in `.psm1`; `Import-Module` in dot-sourced `.ps1`; `NestedModule=` in `.psd1` |\r\n| module reload method | `Import-Module -Force`; `Remove-Module; Import-Module`; `Remove-Module -Force; Import-Module` |\r\n| reloaded module kind | dynamic; script-file backed | (2) |\r\n| file cache invalidation method | touch file; append line to file |\r\n| files checked during cache validation | `.psm1`; `.psd1`; `.ps1` dot-sourced from `.psm1` |\r\n| module arguments | second import of module with different arguments from first |\r\n\r\n1. #6117 is an example of unexpected results when dot-sourcing files from a `.psm1` file.\r\n2.  #4713 is an example of unexpected differences between dynamic and file-backed modules.\r\n\r\nI _think_ the combinatorics for such a matrix would work out to somewhere between single-digit hundreds and single-digit thousands of test cases.  My knowledge of the module reloading implementation is very limited.  I suspect someone with more knowledge of the internals could collapse that matrix down a bit.\r\n\r\nNote that [my prospecting tests](https://gist.github.com/alx9r/7d3c220163bf55daca6fcc544c07ee27) do not include many of these permutations.  One example of a missing permutation is that there is no test for cache invalidation of dot-sourced `.ps1` files.  I understand that that is a distinct equivalence partition for cache invalidation when such a `.ps1` contains a class, is edited, and the module that dot-sources it is reloaded.",

    "body": "Well my thinking is that there are a number of core functionalities in PowerShell that are heavily relied on, but over the years have become large enough that we don't have a good grasp on their semantics or API contracts. For us to extend them, make them more consistent with each other or make them more performant, we're going to need to refactor them. But without extensive regression tests in place that can't be done safely.",
