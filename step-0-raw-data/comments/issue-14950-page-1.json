This is different from the PowerShell location which is specific to the Runspace the pipeling is running in. They are not designed to impact each other because:\r\n\r\n* There can be multiple runspaces per thread, if you are running multiple runspaces then each could be setting their own location overwiting the process wide working directory causing all sorts of race conditions\r\n* A PowerShell location can be more than just a filesystem path, on Windows you have registry/cert/wsman/etc so setting a location to something that isn't a filesystem cannot translate to the current directory\r\n\r\nIn short you should always resolve your paths to the absolute path before calling any .NET functions. This will ensure that any relative directories are relative to PowerShell's location rather than the process wide currenct directory.",

(\"working dirs.\" is just a synonym) _were_ possible, you could defensibly _always_ use the `FileSystem` provider's location, even if the current PowerShell location is a _different_ provider's; that is, you could use `(Get-Location -PSProvider FileSystem).ProviderPath` - in fact, the latter is the robust way to refer to PowerShell's current _file-system_ location (directory).\r\n\r\n* Unfortunately, it is currently cumbersome to resolve a mere file name or relative path to its full, _native_ path (given that .NET methods generally don't understand PowerShell-only drives), as is needed for calling. NET methods:\r\n  * If the path refers to an _existing_ item, the solution is simple: `(Convert-Path $relativePath)`\r\n  * Otherwise, things get cumbersome, because `Convert-Path` doesn't work with _not-yet-existing_ items, as is typical when you pass an _output_ file name, for instance; you have to resort to `Join-Path (Get-Location -PSProvider FileSystem).ProviderPath $relativePath` or `[IO.Path]::GetFullPath($relativePath, (Get-Location -PSProvider FileSystem).ProviderPath)` or - only interactively, because it isn't robust - `\"$PWD/$relativePath\"`\r\n  * Potential future improvements are:\r\n     * Make `Convert-Path` support non-existing paths too - see #2993\r\n     * Introduce a PowerShell-aware helper type that makes conversion to a full, native file-system path easy, along the lines of `[PSPathInfo] $relativePath` - see #14745 \r\n",
