    "body": "> I used such workaround while playing with getters/setters :-)\r\n\r\nAbsolutely fair enough when prototyping.\r\n\r\nMy feeling is that the AST's job is to faithfully represent the syntax, and it's up to the compiler (or other AST consumer) to decide how it deals with absent pieces. Basically my feeling is that this is a layering violation. But I'm not sure if others agree with me.\r\n\r\n> So I guess there could be other (many!) such patterns. Huge work to review manually... Maybe we could create a tool to automate this process (parse-recover-compare)?\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how easy this would be to automate, given that it has to compare user expectation (and the AST is very much the API for it -- we're hitting places where the API is kinda lying). I've hit a couple of things like this before and have a small catalogue of them in my head (and suspect others might too), so we could ask for people to dump anything they've been holding on to in issues. Also, I hit this writing [this](https://github.com/rjmholt/MicrosoftPowerShellModules/blob/asttools/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.AstTools/src/PrettyPrinter.cs), which has been a nice comparison tool between what the AST literally encodes vs what the coder wrote. So we might pick up some more there. Also just reading through the parser might pick some of these up.",
