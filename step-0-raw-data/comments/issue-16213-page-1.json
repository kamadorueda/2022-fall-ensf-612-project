Actually, installation of them via Microsoft Store is – or was until recently, if what you have stated is correct – not possible.\r\n\r\nResearch the ‘runFullTrust’ capability. Additionally, because PowerShell has already been distributed via the Microsoft Store at ‘http://microsoft.com/p/powershell/9mz1snwt0n5d’, I am confident that PowerShell has been packaged as MSIX. My sole proposition is addition of this to ‘http://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases’.",
