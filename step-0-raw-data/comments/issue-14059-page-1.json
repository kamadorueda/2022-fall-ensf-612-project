You're making the reasonable assumption that PowerShell 7.1 will upgrade and replace 7.0. But MSI and MSIX don't talk to each other. This is by design. They are two different silos. This also explains why it is possible to have two, side-by-side installations of 7.1: MSI (Web/VSCode) and MSIX (Microsoft Store). Without realizing it, you've crossed a technology border in going from PowerShell 7.0 (MSI) to 7.1 (MSIX). \r\n\r\nIf your intent is to standardize on the Store version, the proper way would be to uninstall the MSI versions and to get PowerShell only from the store. Because Settings might not differentiate between MSI and MSIX, I recommend uninstalling all PowerShell 6.0+ versions and then installing from the Store. This will make it easier to get back on track. \r\n\r\nAnother point of confusion might be that regardless of which PowerShell 6.0+ version you're using, PowerShell 5.1 will always be installed. The technical reason for this is 5.1 has cmdlets and compatibility not present in PowerShell 6.0+. PowerShell 5.1 is 'Windows&nbsp;PowerShell'. And PowerShell 6.0+ is 'cross-platform&nbsp;PowerShell'. \r\n",
