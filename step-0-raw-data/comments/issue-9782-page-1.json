    "body": "Yeah this is what you can call by design. Because `Get-Content` passes items along the pipeline one at a time, it's not going to be done reading the file by the time the `Out-File` cmdlet is called. In fact, the way the cmdlet is designed, the file handle isn't released until the pipeline is completed, so you can't read _and_ write to a file in the same pipeline.\r\n\r\nThe short solution is to force all the input to be pulled before sending it along the pipe; this can be done pretty simply with some parentheses:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Path = 'C:\\Test.txt'\r\n'A' | Set-Content -Path $Path\r\n(Get-Content -Path $Path -Raw) | ForEach-Object { $_ + 'B' } | Set-Content -Path $Path\r\nGet-Content -Path $Path -Raw\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven the behaviour of `-Raw` I don't see why it wouldn't be able to release the file handle early in that particular situation, since it's reading the whole file in one go anyway. That would be a possible feature enhancement, I would think. 🙂 ",
