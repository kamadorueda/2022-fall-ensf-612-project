    "body": "The problem is that when `Get-Clipboard` splits the text on the clipboard into individual lines (as it does, except if `-Raw` is passed), it only recognizes LF-only newlines as newlines, and retains the CR in Windows-style CRLF as _part of the lines_.\r\n\r\nThe problem is here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/11a5d940c4f797be2b6f61c1bf619ccd3a667ce4/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/GetClipboardCommand.cs#L71-L72\r\n\r\nThat is, instead of exhibiting the usual _platform-agnostic_ newline treatment - recognizing CR-only, LF-only, and CRLF _interchangeably_ - only the _platform-native_ newline sequence is recognized.\r\n\r\nSeemingly, Excel uses CRLF newlines even on macOS, which causes the problem.\r\n\r\nA simpler way to reproduce the problem on macOS:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> sh -c 'printf ''line 1\\r\\nline 2\\r\\n'' | pbcopy'; (Get-Clipboard) -replace \"`r\", '\\r'\r\nline 1\\r\r\nline 2\\r\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso note the empty line at the end, which represent an extra, empty output string, which points to an unrelated secondary problem that isn't platform-specific and is also present in Windows PowerShell - see #14810\r\n",
