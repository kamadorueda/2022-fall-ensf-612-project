Changing (or replacing) these protocols is very complex and long time task. In fact, this is not realistic to change for reasons of backward compatibility too.\r\n\r\nAll this does not exclude the use of alternative solutions, modules, designed specifically to solve this problem. I canâ€™t indicate specific solutions, but I hope they exist. The capabilities of PowerShell allow you to utilize the capabilities of almost any API.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
