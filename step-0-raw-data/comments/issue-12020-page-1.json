Getting a fix into dash and then getting that fix packaged into distros will take time and I'm not even sure if that fix would be back ported by canonical/Microsoft. The WSL kernel is 4.4 after all. And after all that, /bin/sh could point to tcsh, ksh, or some other unknown shell that might be required to be fixed and back ported as well.  Lastly, I don't think it's a ton of work to do a:  `if (File.Exists(\"/bin/bash\") { ... }`  and be able to have this working right now. ",

    "body": "Good catch, @gdoenlen:\r\n\r\nWhile running `/bin/sh -l` interactively also processes the scripts in `/etc/profile.d/`, the offending command is inside a _conditional_ that happened not to be true on my system, so the problem didn't surface:\r\n\r\nFrom `/etc/profile.d/apps-bin-path.sh`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Expand $PATH to include the directory where snappy applications go.\r\nsnap_bin_path=\"/snap/bin\"\r\nif [ -n \"${PATH##*${snap_bin_path}}\" -a -n \"${PATH##*${snap_bin_path}:*}\" ]; then\r\n    export PATH=$PATH:${snap_bin_path}\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is:\r\n\r\n* This script is _not robust_ due to the lack of `\"...\"` around the RHS and shouldn't have been written that way, knowing that all POSIX-compliant  shells have to be able to execute it properly. \r\n\r\n   * This is especially unfortunate, because only a few lines later the robust syntax _is_ used:\r\n`export XDG_DATA_DIRS=\"${XDG_DATA_DIRS}:${snap_xdg_path}\"`\r\n\r\n* As for the impact:\r\n\r\n  * The problem usually doesn't surface in stand-alone Ubuntu installations, because having directory paths _with spaces_ in `PATH` is atypical.\r\n\r\n    * However, if you did add such entries, the `/bin/sh` (`dash`) instance that processes `/etc/profile` _on system startup_ (and from which all user processes inherit their environment) would report a nonzero exit code that causes a blocking GUI error message to pop up during startup.\r\n\r\n  * Additionally, even on Windows (with Windows path integration enabled) the problem only surfaces if directory `/snap/bin` isn't already in listed in `PATH` \r\n\r\n    * In a standalone, full Ubuntu (virtual) machine, `/snap/bin` _is_ already in the `PATH` by the time a user's default shell is run, given that `snap` (package manager Snappy) comes preinstalled on Ubuntu 16.04+, and the variable is set when `/bin/sh` processes `/etc/profile` _during system startup_. It is for that reason that Ubuntu terminal emulators do _not_ invoke user shells as _login_ shells - it simply isn't necessary.\r\n\r\n    * That isn't the case on WSL, however, which is not a full Ubuntu VM, but a compatibility layer on top of the Windows kernel, so there's no boot-time `/bin/sh` process that processes `/etc/profile`; to make up for that WSL _does_ invoke user shells as _login_ shells.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThus, using `bash` indeed sounds like the right pragmatic workaround.\r\n\r\nThis is unfortunate, because for long-term stability, speed (though the impact is probably negligible), and implementation simplicity, `/bin/sh -l` is the right choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
