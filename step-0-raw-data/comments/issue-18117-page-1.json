    "body": "Have you tried saving the ssh output to a variable and then piping that variable into your script? I would guess the issue is that ssh intercepts your input, and because you are piping it's output into the script, it is still active when the breakpoint hits, causing the issue. By saving to a variable first, you ensure that only one interactive process runs at a time.\r\n\r\nIf that is indeed the case, I don't see how PowerShell can handle it, it's the same why I don't expect `vim | vim -` to ever work. Though you may raise a bug in ssh that they shouldn't do any terminal intercepts when running a command instead of interactive prompt. ",

For comparison, PS 5.1 is able to enter the debugger (and accept keyboard debugger input) at the specified breakpoint without crashing.\r\n\r\nIf the debugger can't attach to the console input due to another process, then there should be a [non-fatal] error indicating the debugger cannot be initialized in that manner. Alternatively, if an external debugger is attached via PSES/etc., then it's possible (maybe even likely) the console debugger interface isn't being used at all.\r\n\r\n> you may raise a bug in ssh\r\n\r\nAgain, I don't think this is ssh's \"fault\" - any other process could lock stdin.

The unhandled error is \"Cannot read keys when either application does not have a console or when console input has been redirected\" so this could come from _anything_. ssh is **unusual** in doing this for one scenario (a terminal session) where you wouldn't have output to pipe, AND supporting running a command whose output might go into a pipeline. But I doubt if it is **unique**.  \r\nChanging ssh to work differently, is a large change that is difficult to make, changing PowerShell to not crash is smaller, easier to change and applies to other things. No prizes for guessing what the right thing to do is, this isn't a common scenario so I don't see it jumping to the front of the queue, but it should be accepted that it's a bug. \r\n\r\n",
