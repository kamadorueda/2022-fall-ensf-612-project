    "body": "> I was told by Azure-PS team to come here\r\n\r\nApologies, I misunderstood this as \"the AzPS team told me the issue lies with PowerShell\" rather than \"I'm trying to help the AzPS team fix this and I'm here for answers\".\r\n\r\nBasically the fix depends on:\r\n\r\n- How this method is being called/needs to be called (is it always from within the scope of a cmdlet's process methods, or can it be from other threads?)\r\n- What is needed from the existing context and why the original runspace is being use\r\n\r\nBasically, if this is always being called from the original cmdlet thread under the callstack of `BeginProcessing()`/`ProcessRecord()`/`EndProcessing()`, then it's enough just to use a nested PowerShell instance:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing (var pwsh = PowerShell.Create(RunspaceMode.CurrentRunspace))\r\n{\r\n    pwsh.AddCommand(\"Write-Progress\")\r\n        .AddParameter(\"Id\", activityId)\r\n        .AddParameter(\"Activity\", activity)\r\n        .AddParameter(\"Status\", Rsrc.PSSyncOutputEventsLogProgressCompleteCompleted)\r\n        .AddParameter(\"Completed\")\r\n        .Invoke();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, if this is being called from multiple threads as I suspect, then we need to understand the requirements better to come up with a better mechanism to synchronise usage or to otherwise manage the concurrent use of PowerShell resources. Some avenues available are:\r\n\r\n- Creating a new runspace to support background operations, or even using a runspace pool\r\n- Using appropriate [`PSThreadOptions`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.psthreadoptions) to create that runspace\r\n- Using PowerShell eventing for background tasks\r\n- Creating a more customised concurrency management model, like a consumer thread\r\n\r\nIn this particular case though, we're trying to write progress, which is a user-facing UI task (i.e. very much a *foreground* operation). In PowerShell, you don't need to create and execute a `PowerShell` instance for this. Instead, you can use the Host's UI property (`$Host.UI`, also available in `PSCmdlet`s with the [`Host`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.pscmdlet.host) property) to write things whenever you like -- no synchronisation required. But this is a bad idea, because writing output to the screen while the user is doing something else is at best a strange experience and at worst totally mangles their terminal.\r\n\r\nSo my recommendation is:\r\n\r\n- We need to understand the requirements of how `PSSyncOutputEvents` is being used.\r\n    - Is it just being used to write to the UI, or does it need to actually execute commands?\r\n    - If it is executing commands etc, does it need the current runspace to do it?\r\n    - Under what circumstances are other threads calling into `PSSyncOutputEvents` and why?\r\n- Based on our understanding of those requirements, we should\r\n    - Turn purely UI-facing methods into well synchronised calls into the current Host UI, rather than creating a new `PowerShell` instance\r\n    - Come up with a robust thread model for any remaining invocations that need to run PowerShell",
