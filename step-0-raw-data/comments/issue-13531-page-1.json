PowerShell is large and complex and it is impossible to know well all code base so every WG brings together experts in an area of expertise. You can join a WG that matches your interests.\r\n\r\nAs for the issue, feel free to contribute. We ask to do PRs as small as possible. (You can be asked to add new tests if a code is not covered by tests and to measure performance if PR is related to performance.)",
