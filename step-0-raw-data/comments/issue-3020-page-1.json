    "body": "Right-click-paste could use some modernization, pasting the entire clipboard buffer into the console as if you had shift+entered each line and then running it that way. Even without considering this issue I think that would be useful by itself -- how many times have you right-click-pasted something that wasn't quite right (parse errors) and saw a bunch of error messages, perhaps interspersed with a few commands that executed? That could be quite harmful, depending on what you were pasting (oops, that `cd` command didn't parse properly, so I stayed in my current C:\\ directory when the `del *.* -r -fo`  command executed...). It would be better if right-click-paste actually pasted the entire block, and PowerShell handles that well on the execution side already.\r\n\r\nTechnically the interactive experience today is already different from putting the same text in a script because right-click-paste executes commands as they are pasted in, rather than as a collection of commands. The result is that parsing errors don't prevent partial execution in right-click-paste while they do in scripts.\r\n\r\nAlso, for interactive, ad-hoc PowerShell, I think it's pretty uncommon for users to enter multi-line commands by typing them in at the console, and for users who do this today, they can continue to do it just as they have always done. For the rest of us normal folk, our pipelines will be on a single line unless we right-click-paste, which as was pointed out above, could, and probably should, be improved so that the interactive experience really is as close as possible, ideally identical, to putting the same text in a script.\r\n\r\nAll to say: +1 for having PowerShell support pipelines at the beginning of a line without line continuance characters, and a request to fix right-click-paste so that there is better consistency between interactive use and the scripting experience.",

    "body": "@Jaykul This will completely break the interactive command line experience. For example, say you type a command and hit return\r\n```\r\nPS> dir\r\n>\r\n```\r\nDo you get output? No you do not  because the parser is waiting for the next token which _might_ be a continuation. Now bang on the return key. Nothing happens  except you see more prompts because the parser is still waiting for a token to see if it is a continuation. \r\n```\r\nPS> dir\r\n>\r\n>\r\n```\r\nOK -  add `| sort Length` and hit return.\r\n```\r\nPS> dir\r\n>\r\n>\r\n> | sort Length\r\n>\r\n```\r\nAnd still nothing happens because there _still_ might be a continuation token so it's still gotta listen for a new line.  Now you say 'i'm done with this - it doesn't work, let's just get the date'.  You type `Get-Date` and hit return. Yay - you get output. But it's not from `Get-Date`. Nope - you've finally completed the `dir | sort Length` command so this is the output you see. In the meantime, the command reader is now waiting for you to complete the command you started with `Get-Date`.  Or the whole thing might just be an error. \r\n\r\nThis would be a horrible interactive experience for any user.\r\n\r\nCould we make it work only in files? Yeah - probably but as @lzybkr mentioned, one of our base design principles was that what worked on the command line could simply be pasted into a file and vise versa. We even support pasting from Word documents with emdash and endash characters.\r\n\r\nSo while I do actually like how '|' looks at the start of the line in things like Haskell pattern matching:\r\n```\r\nfib n | n == 0 = 1\r\n  | n == 1 = 1\r\n  | n >= 2 = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)\r\n ```\r\nit won't work for PowerShell.",

Elm, Haskell and Elixir are, of course, not shells. \r\n\r\n> _complaints about bad hosts_...\r\n\r\nThe interpreter provides information to the host application by throwing an `IncompleteParse` exception. It's up to the host implementation to catch this and prompt for more input. If the host is doing this wrong, complain to the host owner.\r\n\r\n> If you guys really think there are no differences between interactive and scripts, you need to try using PowerShell without PSReadLine once in a while.\r\n\r\nI used PowerShell for well over a **decade** without PSReadLine. Is that enough?\r\n\r\n> This errors at the prompt unless using soft returns, note the two blank lines;\r\n\r\nHow that's handled is up to the host implementation. Open an issue on the offending hosts if you want this changed. \r\n\r\n> exactly the same issue that if/else does when executed in the prompt.\r\n\r\nYup. It's ambiguous. Sorry. I couldn't think of a way to make it work reliably. If we'd gone with OTBS instead of matching C#'s brace style, this wouldn't have been significant. In fact there would have been a lot of advantages to using OTBS (e.g. DSLs). Also note: in the original console host, this did \"work\" because after receiving the first `IncompleteParse` exception, the host just kept reading lines until it hit a blank line, then executed the result. But this means you always had to hit an extra newline.\r\n\r\n@Jaykul So do you want the opposite of F#'s #light directive? Something like #heavy where spaces are irrelevant and semicolons are mandatory?",

Syntax highlighting doesn't really make it stand out for the most part -- most highlight schemes render it a pretty dull colour.\r\n\r\nAdd to that the fact that when you go back and edit something littered with backticks, the probability you'll just accidentally miss a backtick or two that got misplaced amidst the edits is pretty high.\r\n\r\nI would use that form if tracing backtick mistakes wasn't like finding a needle in a haystack. No, I think it'd just be better to permit the pipe-at-the-beginning format as a style in its own right, without mandating escaping the line. :/",

But the copy-paste thing is currently only _fully_ true only as long as you're pasting into PSReadLine's Ctrl+V and not via right-clicking -- and this change **would work** there as well.

It's _driving me a little crazy_ that we're spending this much effort debating one _more_ problem with pasting into {{not-our-problem}} but we're fine with the fact that it would be syntax that doesn't work in older versions of PowerShell...\r\n\r\nP.S.

As an aside I installed it on Manjaro Linux yesterday and wasa little in awe that it built it all from scratch. And so quickly.\r\n\r\nI also agree with @RichardSiddaway that it would be good to be able to have the _option_ of using the line continuation character at the start of the line. I'm a big advocate in coding for readability so the indentation (ie. first option) is what I use and I'm happy with. I actually don't like the look of the second option (I think it looks ugly :)) but it takes any ambiguity out of it. And I'm all for people having choices if it improves readability!",
