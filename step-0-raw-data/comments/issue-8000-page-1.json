    "body": "There are several factors at play here:\r\n\r\n* The event _never_ kicks in if PowerShell is not in control of its own termination: Thus, closing the window / quitting the terminal emulator will _not_ run the event handler. \r\n\r\n   * This may be a fundamental limitation that is here to stay, but perhaps someone more knowledgeable in this area can tell us.\r\n\r\n* When PowerShell does exit by itself (whether normally or via a script-terminating error generated with `throw`), the handler does run, but attempts to use of much of PowerShell's regular functionality _fail quietly_, which is what you saw:\r\n\r\n   * When your code is run _in-process in a PowerShell session_, it does work for me on `exit`-ing that session.\r\n\r\n   * By contrast, if I run it _via the CLI_ (`pwsh -c ...`) - whether from PowerShell or `cmd.exe` / Bash - it fails (see test command below). What _seems_ to happen (I'm speculating) is that at the time the script block executes, all modules except `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility` have already been unloaded, and attempts to use their commands fail silently and abort execution of the script block instantly.\r\n     * `Set-Content` is part of module `Microsoft.PowerShell.Management`, and therefore unavailable; if I substitute `Out-File` in your command, which comes with `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility`, the script block works as expected.\r\n\r\n    * In either invocation scenario you also cannot use `Write-Output` or implicit output to send output to the _display_ (redirection to a file works, though) - only `Write-Host` is effective.\r\n\r\nAt the very least, the documentation needs to be improved to clarify the constraints: I've asked for that in https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4061.\r\n\r\nHere's a test command via the CLI that demonstrates that the handler _is_ invoked, but fails when `Set-Content` is called:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Call from PowerShell itself or Bash.\r\npwsh -nop -c '$null = Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier Powershell.Exiting -Action { write-host before; try { Set-Content -ErrorAction stop -Value (Get-Date) -Path ~/t.txt } catch { write-host $_.ToString() }; write-host after }'\r\n\r\n# Call from cmd.exe.\r\npwsh -nop -c \"$null = Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier Powershell.Exiting -Action { write-host before; try { Set-Content -ErrorAction stop -Value (Get-Date) -Path ~/t.txt } catch { write-host $_.ToString() }; write-host after }\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above yields:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nbefore\r\nThe 'Set-Content' command was found in the module 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Management', but the module could not be loaded. For more information, run 'Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Management'.\r\nafter\r\n```",

I'm not sure what to do with this issue, though.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, this is actually by design and I probably should close my ticket.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the design should be improved in my opinion. The exiting Register-EngineEvent should be fired before anything is unloaded. The PowerShell would greatly benefit from that. The use-case where I actually found out about this event was to disconnect from all open Office 365 sessions when you forgot to explicitly disconnect before closing the Window. So you don't end up being locked out until the stale sessions expire. Which doesn't work when the modules are already unloaded when the event fires. \r\n\r\nAnother improvement would be to pass the close-event from the window to the Powershell, so it fires when you close by ALT-F4 or pressing the X. Most PowerShell users are using it on Windows and not on Linux, where you would actually have to run the `exit` command explicitly. Should I open another issue for that, or is it better to discuss this here? The context is already there.",

This needs more investigation.\r\n`PSReadLine` does not seem to have any effect; I've tried the scenario with and without it - result is the same for `close button` scenario.",

The app being designed is without GUI and is designed to work in the background as an Tasktray icon. If you right click the Tasktray the icon scripted and select the manual exit from the generated forms submenu, it works. If you open the \"addition info\" prompt from the submenu and close with the X instead of a graceful exit it throws exceptions... Would be nice if we could handle the closure event with the X.",
