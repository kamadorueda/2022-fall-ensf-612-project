    "body": "I think we need to think about the current behavior again.\r\nToday, the escaped wildcard pattern is respected when it's used for searching an item with wildcard globbing. However, when creating a new item, the path is used as is (in fact, `New-Item` only accept literal path when `-Name` parameter is not used).\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nPS> New-Item [out].txt\r\n\r\n    Directory: F:\\tmp\\modules\\temp\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\n-a----         5/13/2019  9:07 AM              0 [out].txt\r\n\r\nPS> Get-Item '.\\`[out`].txt'\r\n\r\n    Directory: F:\\tmp\\modules\\temp\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\n-a----         5/13/2019  9:07 AM              0 [out].txt\r\n\r\nPS> New-Item '.\\`[out`].txt'\r\n\r\n    Directory: F:\\tmp\\modules\\temp\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\n-a----         5/13/2019  9:08 AM              0 `[out`].txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Out-File` follow this convention (well, partially) -- when searching for an existing file, the escaping of the wildcard pattern is respected (because it's used as a wildcard pattern), however, when no existing file is found and it's time to create a new file, `-Path` doesn't treat the provided path as a literal path like `New-Item` does.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# The provided path is resolved to \"[out].txt\" when searching for an existing file (\"[out].txt\" is an existing file)\r\nPS> \"abc\" | Out-File -Path '.\\`[out`].txt' -Append\r\nPS> Get-Content '.\\`[out`].txt'\r\nabc\r\n# Remove the existing file\r\nPS>rm *\r\n# When creating a new file, the path is used as is\r\nPS:78> \"abc\" | Out-File -Path '.\\`[out`].txt' -Append\r\nPS:79> dir\r\n\r\n    Directory: F:\\tmp\\modules\\temp\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\n-a----         5/13/2019  9:17 AM              5 `[out`].txt\r\n```\r\nThis does seem to be confusing -- `Out-File` would operate on files with different names depending on whether the file already exists or not ... But I think we need to think about the convention in general (e.g. should `New-Item` be changed too? what about `Set-Content` which only search for an existing file before creating a new file?) so that the behavior is not contradicting between different cmdlets.",
