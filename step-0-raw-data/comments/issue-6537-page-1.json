    "body": "@kasper3 This is a commonly requested feature. I have investigated adding something similar and it is possible, but not as simple as one would hope. The value of `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod` is in their processing of output from remote endpoints. As such, much of their code is devoted to that purpose as opposed to downloads. This makes integrating download specific features troublesome.\r\n\r\nI have been drafting an RFC for the inclusion of a new download specific cmdlet. In the move to PowerShell Core the Web Cmdlets lost their ability to work with FTP and FILE URIs. There have also been asks to support downloading of files over other protocols such as SFTP, FTPS, SCP/SSH, etc. There are other download specific features that have been requested including the one in this issue.\r\n\r\nRather than overload the current Web Cmdlets with download features, I would rather have a separate cmdlet that becomes the primary cmdlet for all file download functionality.\r\n\r\nI made an exception with the `-Resume` feature as that was currently a huge pain point and not something users could easily work around. However, for the automatic save path detection/creation feature, I would rather that be held off for the new cmdlet and not included in `Invoke-WebRequest` and `Invoke-RestMethod`. I already plan for this to be a default feature that would work like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-Download $uri\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe file would be saved in the current path and the automatic naming logic would be very similar to wget.",
