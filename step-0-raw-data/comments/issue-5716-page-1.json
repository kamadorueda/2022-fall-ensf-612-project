I have 30 commits to this file and those are only the official squash merges. I have, on average, 3-5 commits to this file per merge addressing PR feedback. Not to mention all the work I do that I end up not submitting PRs for. That is a ton of wasted time dealing with formatting issues in one file or having to just not auto-format it and have to do more commits when the fomating comes up in PR review. It's a waste of your time and my time for so little gain.\r\n\r\nAnd that's just me. Asking future contributors to format this file, but be selective raises the bar on who can contribute. If we can simply tell contributors \"run 'format this document' in VS Code\" and not worry about vertical alignment or unstaging/discarding chunks, we can make this easy and more approachable for new contributors.\r\n  ",

    "body": "I'm fine to use `vscode-powershell` auto-formatting for this particular test file for two reasons:\r\n1. This test file is huge and complex. It consists of tests authored by different people with different styles from the past (maybe some were from the legacy tests written years back).\r\n2. @markekraus is by far (and maybe the foreseeable future) the main contributor to this file. If he thinks formatting this file would improve his productivity in the upcoming work with this file, then I would like to see it happen 😄 \r\n\r\nI totally understand @iSazonov's concern about the vertical alignment on single-line hashtables as sometimes it's important for readability, such as the [`commandString`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/test/powershell/engine/Basic/DefaultCommands.Tests.ps1#L11) table in `DefaultCommands.Tests.ps1`.\r\n\r\nFor this particular file, the Hashtable arrays for `TLS` and `redirect` tests are not too bad without the vertical alignment, so I think it's fine. If someday a new test introduces a bigger table that makes it much worse to read without the vertical alignment, we can always revisit it.\r\n  ",
