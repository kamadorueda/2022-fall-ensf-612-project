That's the error you're getting: `-Force` doesn't work to overwrite a file with a folder, and vice-versa. \r\n\r\nHowever, I believe that  is _implementation specific_ (i.e. the behavior is defined by the _Provider_)...\r\n\r\nAs a side-note, don't forget that `New-Item` has a `-Value` parameter, and works on all sorts of things that are _neither directories nor files_.  I think that makes replacing `-Force` with multiple other switches a huge breaking change...",
