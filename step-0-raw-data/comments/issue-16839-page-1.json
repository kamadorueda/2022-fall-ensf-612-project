So if you don't format the what is returned by `Get-Error` you are left with `$error[i]` having its `PSTypeNames` modified. \r\n```\r\nps> $error[2].pstypenames\r\nSystem.Object\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord\r\n\r\nps> $e = $Error[2] | get-error\r\n\r\nps> $error[2].pstypenames\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord#PSExtendedError\r\nSystem.Object\r\n```\r\n Which is the first wrong, the cmdlet should make a copy, to preserve the original.  $e and $error[2] point to the same bytes.  so when the formatting runs it reverts them that's the second wrong. Get-Error only works properly if the output is immediately formatted which as we see here isn't always the case. There is a much better way to do this - and this isn't the kind of practice built in commands should demonstrate .\r\n\r\n",

It also allows the colors to be specified, sorts out the colons for nested items being less indented and and handles long lines better. \r\n\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/jhoneill/6e79c210f78eda01f72426c173fa2bf4 \r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/images/modules/gists/gist-og-image.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> Gist</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://gist.github.com/jhoneill/6e79c210f78eda01f72426c173fa2bf4\">replaceGet-Error.ps1</a></strong></div><div>GitHub Gist: instantly share code, notes, and snippets.</div></blockquote>",
