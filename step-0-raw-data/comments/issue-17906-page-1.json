We cannot selectively allow some method invocations without possibly compromising our security boundary.\r\n\r\nFor most cases, this can be worked around by using the cmdlet equivalent (e.g., `Get-Variable, Write-Output, Write-Verbose, etc.`).  Unfortunately, there is no cmdlet equivalent for `ShouldProcess`, but we feel there should be one.\r\n\r\nFor now, the workaround for `ShouldProcess` is to make the test trusted by signing it or otherwise including it in the system lock down policy.",
