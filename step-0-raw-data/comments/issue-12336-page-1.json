If untrusted user has an write access to a file we can not trust the file.\r\n\r\nTo provide some context, in our environment our user folder permissions are set up as follows:\r\n\r\n- User has Modify permissions to their entire user folder at \\\\\\server.domain.com\\Users\\Username and all subfolders.\r\n\r\n- Delegated file server administrators have Modify and Full permissions via security groups to all files and folders in the Users share (these permissions are inherited from higher folder levels).\r\n\r\nI mention this to clarify that while in practical terms only the end user has access to the user's folder, and no other regular users have access to the user's folder, technically, the file server administrators are visible in the ACLs of the folder in case your proposal is querying the ACLs of the file.\r\n\r\nIn our scenario, we would still need to trust folders that may exist outside of redirected folders too, so we will likely use option 3 from above (Get trusted patterns from config file/GPO) and hence may not need this, but another way to address redirected folders is to consider trusting the locations of the known SpecialFolders Documents and Desktop.  There is also the issue though when querying \"[Environment]::GetFolderPath(\"MyDocuments\")\" on a system that has AppLocker since PowerShell runs in Constrained Language Mode and hence is unable to run this code to identify the path Documents folder path.  But if PS can still query that somehow and trust it, that could be an option too.",

    "body": "@TravisEz13 I wonder why you ask to limit the feature to the outdated behavior.\r\n\r\n- some Unix APIs/apps check ACLs on their config files and ignore/alert them if discovers that untrusted user has a write access.\r\nI guess some applications on Windows (like SCCM client) could benefit from such feature.\r\n- Scenario: redirect Desktop on terminal server to share and try to open some files in latest Adobe Reader by double click. You will can able open only first file but not next. This is because AR detects that files is placed on network share and open first file in sandbox. If we open a properties of the file we can explicitly see that a path to the file is network. If we do not redirect Desktop AR works as expected and we can open all files by double click. If AR checked the rights to files, then I would not spend time on this case to allow users to open files on the desktop as they do usual.\r\n\r\n> If we don't trust the server, we cannot trust the ACLs on the server so they would be an unreliable way of verifying the server.\r\n\r\nWe do not do a security feature like RDP NLA or TLS. Path wild cards do not allow this too. We have no need to identify a server. We can do only \"measure a trust level\".\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "@TravisEz13 This is also blocking our deployment of PowerShell 7. Unfortunately, being unable to run scripts from trusted network shares (specified by a UNC path with a FQDN) is a deal-breaker. I don't think this is an unusual scenario in enterprise networks, which have a tendency to become a morass of interconnected networks and remote connections over time, despite everyone's best intentions.\r\n\r\n### Proposal to fix this issue\r\nIn my opinion, the only reasonable way to restore expected behaviour is to revert to using urlmon ([`IInternetSecurityManager::MapUrlToZone`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms537133(v=vs.85)) or [`IInternetSecurityManager::ProcessUrlAction`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/ms537136(v=vs.85))), like Windows PowerShell and early versions of PowerShell 6 do. This has been described here as a 'legacy IE API', but in practice it isn't - it's part of the operating system<sup>1</sup>.\r\n\r\nExplorer (as in the shell, not IE) uses it, and [Chromium uses it](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src.git/+/refs/heads/main/net/http/url_security_manager_win.cc) (and therefore, presumably, both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome), to name just two prominent examples.\r\n\r\nI've just double-checked to be certain, and the API continues to be available in both Windows 11 and core installations of Windows Server 2022, _including when IE is removed_.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to put my time where my mouth is and submit a PR to fix this myself, but to be blunt I'm seeing hints of this being a religious issue to some contributors. If I did the work, would it be dismissed out of hand?\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n[1] : I think this comes from the API's provenance and location in the Microsoft Docs tree. I believe it first appeared in one of those platform-update-by-the-back-door releases of Internet Explorer in the late 90s / early 2000s.",

This issue is Windows-only.\r\n2. The solution proposed earlier in this issue involves a fair amount of work and new configuration options (that may be troublesome for enterprises to deploy universally).\r\n3. It's been marked as `Up-for-Grabs` for over a year, this particular issue was created over two years ago, and it's been discussed elsewhere for over four years, without any movement towards implementing a practical solution.\r\n\r\nMy point is that the best way to resolve this and restore expected behaviour is to use the existing API, since it's _not_ actually going away with IE as previously assumed.\r\n\r\nThis will have multiple benefits:\r\n1. It won't require a lot of effort to implement.\r\n2. It'll prevent the need for new options, code and complexity for users that only serve to reproduce documented functionality the OS already makes available.\r\n3. PowerShell 7's behaviour will instantly be in accordance with Windows PowerShell, including taking account of Group Policy set up by admins for just this scenario.\r\n\r\nI also offered to do the work myself so that this problem can be resolved once and for all.\r\n\r\n(Sorry for the delay in response - for some reason I didn't receive a notification.)",
