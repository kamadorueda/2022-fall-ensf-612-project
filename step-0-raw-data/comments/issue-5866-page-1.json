Such a module doesn't exist. If you were shipping such a module _in the box_, then you could use it as an rationale. You're not. This was suggested **months ago** when the first round of arguments about aliases passed -- move the aliases into modules and let people import the ones they want in their profiles. But nothing was done, and now here we are at GA, and the team is still deleting individual aliases.\r\n\r\nI don't care if the alias comes back. Removing it was the **wrong decision**, but for me, it's done.

I can only guess that pressure from outside the PS team forced this change. Therefore I encourage both sides to be reasonable in this discussion.\r\nI personally use around 10 aliases on a daily basis but would not have a problem if one of them got removed and therefore don't understand why this is an issue. Alias customisation is what the profile is for and PSScriptAnalyzer has a rule to warn against the usage of aliases. I personally have a profile consisting of a common profile and additionally special additions when I am in the ISE or ConEmu and I would simply create another one for pwsh, adding one line is not that hard.\r\nBut maybe we need something like an alias 'theme' that consists of an alias list that is optimised for e.g. WindowPowerShell, Unix and I am sure someone makes `posh-alias` at some point.",

Now I have to tote around a profile with me on multiple systems or relearn `set-co<tab>`. This was imposed on me and other users for reasons that escape me. Other alias removals make sense to me. `curl` in linux doesn't have a convenient `.exe` to append to it and the full path is painful.

If the community wants to, we can even include this module in our distributions. Anyone could auto import this module and be happy.\r\n\r\nGuys please  do not speculate - we have dozens of incompatible changes in cmdlets and many features are still not ported - this is the main problem not only for beginners, but also for experts. Better think about it how to help the project faster and easier to solve it.",
