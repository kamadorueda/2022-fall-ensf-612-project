So this change is desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also discussed a bit how to mitigate it, with one suggestion being to default to decimal for real number representations.

Back in the 90's I worked on a graphical programming language that had a special operator for this `~=` (read as \"almost equals\") which performed this comparison for \"close enough equality\": `abs(lhs - rhs) < epsilon`.  I don't remember the exact value we used for epsilon but it was in the area of 1E-13.  \r\n\r\nI doubt the parser would support this syntax but `~eq` would be pretty nifty.  :-)  If not that, then maybe an `-fpeq` or `-eqfp` operator (for floating point equal).",

(We looked into this today and this is beyond a formatter issue; there are places that PowerShell doesn't hook into where this change happens, in fact `(3*1.1).ToString()` has changed behaviour (the real breaking change) and I very much doubt we could fix that in a consistent way)\r\n- The old behaviour was totally misleading. Floating point math is hard enough for those trained to be wary of it, and PowerShell needs to be accessible to casual scripters\r\n\r\nFor a reporting script, that seems like a good candidate for `'{0:g5}' -f $value`",

    "body": "Just want to add that this is a by design change in .NET Core to fix the previously broken round-trippable string returned by `double.ToString()`.\r\nExample:\r\n```\r\n$a = 1.1 * 3\r\n$b = [double]::Parse($a.ToString())\r\n$a -eq $b\r\n```\r\nIn pwsh-7.0.0-preview.1, you will see `$a -eq $b` returns `True`, while in pwsh-6.2 you will see `False`.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate the unfriendly string representation in PowerShell, we will need to change [the `ToString` method](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/MshObject.cs#L1270) in `MshObject.cs`, so that during formatting, all double/float values can be converted to string using the old precision specifiers (`G15` for double and `G7` for float).\r\nAlso, the explicit conversion from double/float to `[string]` also needs to be changed to honor the old precision specifiers.",
