It would be nice for code review.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov I would rather not, unless I absolutely have to.\r\n\r\nThis PR was originally part of #10189, which they asked to be broken up into other PRs. After a side discussion between @TylerLeonhardt, @PaulHigin and @SteveL-MSFT, they suggested this set of changes (adding the `-Runspace` parameter and refactoring under the base classes) as the second phase of the #10189 changes in an email.\r\n\r\nThe only real \"style changes\" are replacement of cmdlet parameter property/field pairs with just properties, using static strings where appropriate (for parameter set names), and adding regions to make the set of breakpoint cmdlet classes consistent with one another. They were made while setting up base classes for the breakpoint cmdlets, which makes the code much easier to maintain going forward. I don't think they should really get in the way of this code review.",
