    "body": "Well we are already always explicitly importing.\r\n\r\nSo to be clear we have mentioned two requirements:\r\n\r\n1. Strict function signatures\r\n\r\nSetting `$PSModuleAutoloadingPreference` to something else than `All` still does not guarantee if the function signature is called correctly \"compile-time\". Am I missing something?\r\n\r\n2. Strict cmdlet importing\r\n\r\nSo here are a few paths to pursue:\r\na) `ModuleQualified`\r\nb) Importing only a selected set of cmdlets \r\nc) Faster PowerShell semantics of explicitly importing cmdlets\r\nd) How to deal with module dependencies\r\n\r\n2a) \r\nInteresting to learn the `ModuleQualified` setting, have not seen it before. Obviously if we would adopt this prefixing, it will have quite some impact on our codebase.  \r\n\r\nI just tried out `powershellget\\Get-InstalledModule` but this results in the error `powershellget\\Get-InstalledModule : The module 'powershellget' could not be loaded. For more information, run 'Import-Module powershellget'.`.\r\n\r\nAnd after I have run `import-module powershellget` I get the error `PackageManagement\\Get-Package : The term 'PackageManagement\\Get-Package' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.`\r\n\r\nI checked the contents of `$env:PSModulePath`; the module `PackageManagement` should be discoverable.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?\r\n\r\n2b) \r\nTrying out the the importing of a limited list of cmdlets. Findings:\r\n* You are required to leave `$PSModuleAutoloadingPreference` to `All` or else many cmdlets cannot be found which are required inside the modules being imported;\r\n* Running `Import-Module Az -Cmdlet Get-AzResource` still gets all Az modules are imported;\r\n* Running `Import-Module Az.Resources -CmdLet Get-AzResource' still gets all cmdlets imported, on top you get the Az.Accounts module in your scope.\r\n\r\nWhat can I do to prevent all those cmdlets to become available in the current scope?\r\n\r\n2c)\r\nObviously the importing is still a runtime thing, so it takes time before completion, and upfront you cannot know which cmdlets become available.\r\n\r\n2d) \r\nWe have a custom module that is depending on the Az modules and AzureAD module having been imported:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nRequiredModules        = @(\r\n        @{\r\n            ModuleName    = 'Az'\r\n            ModuleVersion = '2.6.0'\r\n            Guid          = 'd48d710e-85cb-46a1-990f-22dae76f6b5f'\r\n        }\r\n        @{\r\n            ModuleName    = 'AzureAD'\r\n            ModuleVersion = '2.0.2.31'\r\n            Guid          = 'd60c0004-962d-4dfb-8d28-5707572ffd00'\r\n        }\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally we should move the requirement for imported cmdlets from module level to file level, as is the case with EcmaScript module semantics.",

That kind of analysis for an entire document would be very expensive, especially once you get into type inference (assuming you want to check input signature).

    "body": ">  that some internal projects that have been building extra analysis rules for static analysis? Not suitable for general purpose, but maybe the various bits can be shared to build upon further?\r\n\r\nYeah, I don't control that code but I've seen it and it's very very old and different. There's interest from the owning team to perform a gradual migration, at least of the easier parts. As a first example, see https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/pull/1705.\r\n\r\n> In the meanwhile if I find further time I will try to continue working on a simple custom analyzer that takes import statements inside comment conventions, combined with scraping the abstract syntax tree for function definitions. I started this exploration during past summer break.\r\n\r\nSo on this front, I've seen other examples of custom `#include` pragmas in scripts. `using module` and `using assembly` were meant to be the actual versions of this. But for the most part, my intuition is that analyzers should simply forbid things like:\r\n\r\n- Using variables with `Import-Module` or `Export-ModuleMember`\r\n- Using `*-Variable` cmdlets\r\n- `*-*Item` cmdlets with variable/function providers\r\n- Anything involving dynamic scope (variables not defined in the immediate scope)\r\n- Probably a few other things I haven't thought of that allow you to dynamically create variables/functions\r\n\r\nOnce those become errors, you can statically reason about a lot more things.\r\n\r\nAt that point, you want constant folding (to propagate variable values, splatting, etc) and type inference:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/176303d172bcb0726e097ac5139de9f724ecec6b/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/TypeInferenceVisitor.cs#L42-L50\r\n\r\nYou also need some concept of the modules available at runtime and the whole [command metadata](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.commandmetadata) for each exported command. That's needed to work out types and parameter binding, which can be done today like this:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/77054ff586d2c723114862347b798bd89f8e0c56/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandCompletion/PseudoParameterBinder.cs#L251-L360\r\n\r\nHowever, doing it for an arbitrary target runtime essentially requires a manifest of well-known commands on each platform. I've done a fair amount of the work required for that as part of PSSA's [UseCompatibleCommands rule](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/6222e409059664fa02097af5a79d332c4a26fecd/Rules/CompatibilityRules/UseCompatibleCommands.cs#L101-L152). However, there are plenty of improvements to make there.\r\n\r\nI've also seen things that try to follow through a script's dependencies and dot-sources as well, and those basically require static inference of the filesystem layout in a script/module's deployment environment.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't see a huge reason to build a fresh analyzer from scratch here. PSSA is perfectly capable of providing the platform for a lot of this. But if you are interested, I [started some work to reform PSSA as a platform some time ago](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/tree/pssa2) but had to drop it to work on other things.",
