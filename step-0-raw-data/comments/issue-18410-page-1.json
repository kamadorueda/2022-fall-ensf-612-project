In actuality, the main issue appeared to be PackageManager related.\r\n\r\nHowever, the MS Learn/MSDN pages/blogs did nothing to dissuade me from that line of investigation.\r\n(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/dsc/getting-started/wingettingstarted?view=dsc-1.1&viewFallbackFrom=dsc-3.0 etc)\r\n\r\nFWIW: Installing ps core, or something accompanying it, results in two versions of PackageManager 1.0.0.1 and 1.4.8.1. This further made it seem like DSC/Configuration was good-to-go for PS Core.\r\n\r\nI have to file a separate issue for that, it feels wrong that it complains you have two versions when they are both for different editions, and adding a -ModuleVersion feels like a hack. -ModuleVersion has to be a constant so you can't do your own 'select the right one' :(",
