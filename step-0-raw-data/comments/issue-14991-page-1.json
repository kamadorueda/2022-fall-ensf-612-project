As a work around you can do:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$all = [Windows.Management.Deployment.PackageManager]::new().FindPackages()\r\n$all.AdditionalTypeData[[Collections.IEnumerable].TypeHandle]\r\n```\r\n\r\n/cc @daxian-dbw for awareness. It seems like they've made non-concrete types a lot more complicated to work with.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** Or rather they used to have an `ABI.Systems.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<>` concrete class for enumerable WinRT objects, but have now replaced that with a plain `IInspectable`.",
