This would just be a warning though, so if the regex is too aggressive, we don't cause problems for valid scenarios.",

    "body": "Module manifests, by design, are aggregators of modules. You can have a module that contains nothing but a manifest. That manifest then imports (multiple) other modules and re-exports all, some or none of the imported elements. (This is why Import-Module -verbose shows both import and export messages). Assigning an empty array explicitly means \"export no cmdlets/variables/aliases\" i.e. it's an explicit valid value. That said, it's also unlikely to be used so having Test-ModuleManifest (and Update-ModuleManifest) emit a warning when any of the export field _values_ are set to empty array i.e. @() makes sense.  It's a simple value test that I think we should take.",
