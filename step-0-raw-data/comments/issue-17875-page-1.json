    "body": "Let me try to summarize:\r\n\r\n* Currently, `using module` only accepts static, _literal_ paths. \r\n  * If your module contains classes that you want to import, `using module` is your only (direct) option - `Import-Module` (which places no limits on how you can specify the module path) doesn't import classes.\r\n\r\n* `.` is special-cased in that it (sensibly) refers to the location of the _calling script_ rather than the current location.\r\n\r\n* Introducing the ability to express well-known paths _via abstractions_  in `using module` statements is desirable.\r\n\r\n  * However, given that `using module` is a _parse-time_ statement, support for arbitrary variable references and expressions (which wold require _runtime_ processing) is _not_ an option.\r\n\r\n  * What _would_ work, I think, is to allow references to _environment_ variables, such as `$env:HOME`; while `$env:HOME` could take the place of `~` on Unix, it wouldn't make for a cross-platform abstraction, so allowing `~` as a platform-neutral way to refer to the home directory is useful. \r\n\r\n   * As implied by @SeeminglyScience  above, if `~` support is added, it would probably have to be _static_ path of the user's home directory (that is, a customization of `~` via ` (Get-PSProvider FileSystem).Home = '...'` would _not_ be honored). Conceivably, the (always static) `$HOME` could be supported in lieu of `~`, though that could give rise to the misconception that _any_ variable can be used.\r\n\r\n  * On a more general note, this also takes us back to the discussion on whether there should be a platform-agnostic way to express well-known folder paths, such as via a special `$sf:` namespace:\r\n    * #6966\r\n\r\n\r\n",
