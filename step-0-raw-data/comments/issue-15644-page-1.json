The reason is, I think we can address multi-machine configuration issues that  @terrajobst  experiences  other than with GPO. Many machines are not domain joined or running linux. Tooling support should work over remoting, allowing multi-machine configuration. One question i'm investigating is:\r\n\r\n* PowerShell upgrades should not overwrite the configuration, maintaining desired configuration after upgrade.\r\n\r\nHere is an idea for cmdlet tooling - thoughts?\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-PowerShellConfigurationSetting\r\n# Lists all settings\r\nGet-PowerShellConfigurationSetting -Name “PowerShellTerminalLogo”\r\n# List only the specified setting\r\nSet-PowershellConfigurationSetting -Name “PowerShellTerminalLogo -Value True\r\n# Sets the setting value\r\nGet-PowerShellConfigurationSetting -Name “PowerShellTerminalLogo” | Set-PowerShellConfiguratinSetting -Value True\r\n```",

Noise because you have trained me with the rolled up newspaper, er this text over hundreds and hundreds of new PS session starts.  I really, I mean REALLY don't need to see it anymore.  😜   At the very least, just put the `https://aka.ms/powershell` link in the help topic for `help`.  You could then simplify to:\r\n```\r\nPowerShell 7.3.0 (type 'help' to get help)\r\nPS /home/hillr>\r\n```\r\nThat is **if** the team deems it necessary to always display info on how to get help.  \r\n\r\nOne last comment - I'm not a fan of any of this requiring powershell.config.json changes.  The reduced logo should be the default. No \"additional\" configuration (beyond the existing update check env var) should be required.",

We never discussed this.\r\nEx., VS Code run pwsh - system-wide, installed with VS Code, from my profile? can I have specific config for the scenario? Or whether  I run pwsh from Global tool and with specific config? Should we support host specific configs again?\r\n4. Add more options to configs/envs is bad idea. It is difficult to discover and difficult to replicate. Users can put `cls` to user profile. On Windows the profile can be synced with OneDrive.\r\n5. We want to keep update notification.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe need PowerShell Committee conclusion before change something, if change.\r\n",

We looked at other shells like `zsh`, `csh`, `bash` and each of them simply show a prompt without additional information as the user explicitly started those shells and should know what they are using.  We agreed to have the default not show any logo information.  However, upgrade information will still be shown unless suppressed by existing means.  A new `-Logo` switch will be added to retain current behavior (or just `PowerShell <version>`).  Waiting on legal and marketing approval before finalizing.  We would have this as an Experimental feature pending user feedback.",

As such, how quick the first text appears is rather irrelevant, considering the prompt or the characters typed don't appear.\r\n\r\nEdit: Also, I think people who want to use a shell are knowledgeable enough to not need deception about how quickly the shell loads.\r\n\r\nCurrently, PowerShell prints \"Loading personal and system profiles took 532ms.\", so it's also in plain sight that it takes half a second for PowerShell to be ready. This \"snappy\" appearance is just essentially either deception or a simpler loading screen, and I think neither is needed for someone who knows how to work with a shell.\r\n\r\nEdit 2: If this default is still desired (a default which I consider an insult to the user, but it's probably just my uninformed opinion), then perhaps a switch that toggles from \"print logo then load runspace\" to \"load runspace then run Logo function\" would be the best way to please everyone? The default would still be there, and anyone not pleased with it can switch to having a custom function that prints just what they please.\r\n\r\nThat \"switch\" I'm talking about should be something that can be toggled once and saved forever, perhaps in a configuration file.",
