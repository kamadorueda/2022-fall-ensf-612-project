    "body": "> `-CommandType` shouldn't imply `-All`\r\n\r\nI disagree. `Get-Command` without `-all` or `-CommandType` resolves the command that would be run. Supplying `-CommandType` does not. to me, it implies that i want to see all commands of that type. \r\n\r\nIf I have `function:notepad` that will trump either application in cmd resolution. I expect `Get-Command` without `-all` or `-CommandType` to resolve the exact command that would be run if I issue `notepad`. It would return `function:notepad`. When I'm specifying `Get-Command -CommandType Application notepad` I expect to see all the *application* `notepad`s. if it only returned the first one, what help would that be? That's not the command that will run when I issue `notepad` as the function would be run instead. It doesn't make any sense to me to issue `-All` here. I'm implying I want to see all the application type with that command name.. Also absent a name `Get-Command -CommandType Cmdlet` I would expect that to return all cmdlets, not just the first one. It would be confusing to me to have a difference in  `-CommandType`  whether I supplied `-Name` or not.\r\n\r\n",
