One can even `throw` in the transformation if the input values aren't valid - to avoid repeating values in a  validate set.   But that attribute is just moving code out of the function body and making it sharable between functions which have a parameter (and its values) in common.  There just as much work to do for each parameter,  What's proposed would yield code which was quicker and easier to write and to understand when maintaining it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

If everything is split up we'd have a completer attribute, a validator attribute and a transformer attribute. \r\n\r\nI think the original designers thought it would be silly put the same values in a completer and in a validator which is why a validateSet does double duty as a completer.  Martin's view is seems to be more purist than yours and mine. _To me_  a bunch of lines like :\r\n```\r\nif     ($x -ieq \"darkred\" ) {$x = \"DarkRed\" } \r\nelseif ($x -ieq \"darkblue\") {$x = \"DarkBlue\"}\r\n ```\r\nor an equivalent `switch`  (where it is not simply `ToUpper`, `ToLower`) is effort which would be good to remove. \r\n\r\nAIUI it needs a change to allow a _validator_  to change the value of the parameter it is validating.  (Which would allow a single custom class to validate and transform).  _I don't think_ that adds too much difficulty. .  \r\n\r\n",
