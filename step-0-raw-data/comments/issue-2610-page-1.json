Note that the issue seems to really only be that test-modulemanifest didn't normalize paths correctly and had a hard coded '\\' for directory separator so it wouldn't ever work on non-Windows.  You'll still get one error for PowerShellGet.psd1 on Linux because the RequiredModule version doesn't match what is on Linux.",
