    "body": "From https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13425#issuecomment-674141211:\r\n\r\nGenerally I personally prefer public methods on internal and private classes; a class/object has a public API and private methods, internal implies a secondary API and muddies thinking around the cohesion and contract around a class. More than that, keeping members `public` is arguably *DRY*er, since the API represented by the class now has its exposure controlled by a single keyword at the class level.\r\n\r\nHowever, in PowerShell there is a consideration that once you have an object, any public member on it is visible to PowerShell (even if the class itself is internal), which drives a lot of the other classes that have internal members on everything. So there is an externally appreciable difference between an internal type with public members and an internal type with internal members. While we don't consider an internal change like that to be breaking, it's still a change that could affect users.",
