New extensions become messy and make for transitions between versions supporting multiple versions painful. I realize it would be coercive in the \"you must use `.ps6` for core\" sense, but as people begin to adopt it you start getting modules and projects with mixed extensions. Python ultimately went with the assumption that users would just have to know what they're doing. \r\n\r\nIn any case, I would urge that the decision to add a new extension not be taken lightly. It may be simplest in implementation, but it could have a massive and lasting impact on the PowerShell ecosystem as a whole.",

The main problem I can see is that even if we add support for `#requires -v 6.1.0` which automatically tries to find 6.1.0 and execute it, it means we also need to update Windows PowerShell with that logic which means only Win10/Server2016 would get that change.  A workaround (which I don't like) is to use a batch file to wrap scripts in cases where you can't specify `pwsh.exe <script.ps1>`.  ",

It seems like `#requires` is the appropriate way to declare that dependency. Although I'd prefer a new `-Edition` parameter and not solely rely on `-Version` >= 6.  Even though it isn't the plan for Windows PowerShell to ever hit v6.0 - plans change.  Better to have a more \"explicit\" declaration of what is required IMO.",

    "body": "My scenario: user opens PowerShell (v5) from start menu, goes to run my script. Oh no, my script is designed for PowerShell 6!\r\n\r\nIf the user just typed \"pwsh myscript.ps1\" it would work. But now PowerShell 5 chokes on the script with some obscure API error.\r\n\r\nI want v5 to automatically execute v6 instead when it detects some annotation. It should prefer \"pwsh\" in PATH or registry or whereever. I do not wish to hardcode any paths to pwsh in my scripts (especially given that they are crossplatform scripts).\r\n\r\n> it means we also need to update Windows PowerShell with that logic which means only Win10/Server2016 would get that change\r\n\r\nThis limitation would be perfectly acceptable for me.\r\n\r\nAlternatively to a language extension, perhaps a PowerShell module that provides some Invoke-SelfWithV6 command or equivalent?",

    "body": "I love that @markekraus brought up python, since the python community has come up with so many takes on launching the \"right\" python. Version 3.3 added the \"py\" launcher utility, somewhat like the visual studio selector utility. One can specify a version like `py -3 script.py`, but it can also use the version from the shebang line if it's there. More comprehensive utilities (pipenv) pick up requirements from associated files. Whether the signature comprises a shebang line or the `#requires` or a `script.ps1.config`, having a utility to launch the right version of powershell for a given script would be very useful.",
