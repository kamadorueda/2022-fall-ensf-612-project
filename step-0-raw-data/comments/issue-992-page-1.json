    "body": "Note: In this discussion, we're equating PowerShell _profiles_ with _one_ type of initialization file in POSIX-like shells, the \"_individual per-interactive-shell startup file\"_, as Bash calls it, stored in `~/.*rc` files; e.g., `~/.bashrc` for Bash. In POSIX-like shells, _profiles_ are distinct initialization files (which, unlike the `~/.*rc` files, exist both on a system and at a user level) only sourced  by _login shells_, irrespective of interactivity; A POSIX-like shell is a login shell only if the `-l` option is explicitly passed or invocation happens via the `login` utility - PowerShell has _no_ equivalent to that, but in contrast with POSIX-like `~/.*rc` files, PowerShell's profiles exist both at the current-user and all-users (and host) levels.\r\n\r\n* Shebang lines  (`#!...`) on Unix platforms only every work with _absolute paths_.\r\n\r\n* Only _2_ tokens are portably supported (`#!/path/to/foo bar`; macOS supports more, but Linux doesn't).\r\n\r\n* Given that the `powershell` binary (a symlink to it) is installed in different locations across supported Unix platforms (`/usr/bin` on Linux vs. `/usr/local/bin` on macOS), the only way to portably target PowerShell is to invoke it via `env`, relying on `env`'s ability to locate it via the `$PATH`, i.e.: `#!/usr/bin/env powershell`\r\n\r\n   * This means that if you want your script to remain portable, passing any parameters to `powershell` itself as part of the shebang line is NOT an option, given that `#!/usr/bin/env powershell` already uses up the 2 tokens that are portably supported.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* POSIX-like shells (`bash`, `ksh`, `zsh`) do NOT load their initialization files (`~/.*rc`) if _they themselves_ determine that they're being invoked _non-interactively_, such as via a shebang line.\r\n\r\n  * Providing something like `$host.IsInteractive` would be helpful in general, but should _not_ come into play here; in fact, initialization files doing their own interactivity detection causes [nothing but trouble](https://github.com/mklement0/n-install/issues/1#issuecomment-128536212), because it gets in the way of non-interactive scripts purposely re-sourcing initialization files after their modification.\r\n\r\n * Thus, if PowerShell wants to fit into the Unix world specifically and more generally wants to _provide a predictable scripting environment_ it _mustn't load profiles by default_ when executing scripts; unfortunately, that is a breaking change; see #3743",

    "body": "@RichardSiddaway: \r\n\r\nNote that a shebang line is just syntactic sugar (handled by the system) for invoking the executable named in it with the full path of containing file, so that `#!/usr/bin/pwsh` inside file `/path/to/script` is equivalent to explicit invocation `/usr/bin/pwsh /path/to/script`. Not only would it be difficult to distinguish these two forms, they _should_ be considered the same.\r\n\r\nTo be clear: the suggestion is not to make non-loading of the profile the default _categorically_, but only for _non-interactive_ scenarios, which notably includes executing a _script_.\r\n\r\nThis distinction is sensible:\r\n\r\n* When executing a _script_, do not load profiles, so as to provide a predictable, standardized execution environment.\r\n\r\n* When starting an _interactive_ session, load the profiles for a customized interactive experience with custom aliases, functions, ...\r\n\r\n@rkeithhill's example shows that automatic loading of profiles for script execution is problematic in practice - ranging from distracting extraneous output / benign errors to fundamentally changing the script's behavior.\r\n\r\nAlso note that even if this issue is addressed, invoking `*.ps1` files _in-process_ from an interactive session will continue to run in an environment customized by profiles.\r\n(This issue doesn't even arise in POSIX-like shells, where all scripts invariably run in a _child_ process (unless explicitly _sourced_) that is unaffected by the parent shell's state, save for modifications to _environment variables_.)\r\n\r\nAs @iSazonov notes, something's gotta give.\r\nIf a breaking change is not an option: To modify his suggestion, perhaps a _single_ wrapper for `pwsh -noprofile` for use in shebang lines (or directly) is a reasonable compromise: `#!/usr/bin/env pwsh-np`\r\n\r\n",

However it does require a local startupconfig.json file to tell it where the app files are located. So the exe and a simple json file are similar in functionality to the symbolic link original requirements and this new functionality will be leveraged by global tools.\r\n\r\nIf I understand this correctly, then a shim executable with accompanying `startupconfig.json` will do.\r\n\r\nAs an aside: As I've mentioned in the linked issue, I can't help but think that a symlink-based solution should be technically possible, via  [GetFinalPathNameByHandle](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa364962%28v=vs.85%29.aspx), but from the absence of feedback I infer that there's no intent to tackle this.\r\n",

    "body": "It would really be nice to have something for 6.1 that works on Windows as well.  I've been trying to use git pre-commit hooks on my Windows dev box to ensure I have the right email configured.  This works but it slows down all my commits because it processes my profile scripts when it does **not** need to:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env pwsh\r\n\r\n# Verify user's Git config has appropriate email address\r\nif ($env:GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL -notmatch '@(non\\.)?acme\\.com$') {\r\n    Write-Warning \"Your Git email address '$env:GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL' is not configured correctly.\"\r\n    Write-Warning \"It should end with '@acme.com' or '@non.acme.com'.\"\r\n    Write-Warning \"Use the command: 'git config --global user.email <name@acme.com>' to set it correctly.\"\r\n    exit 1\r\n}\r\n\r\nexit 0\r\n```\r\nThe only work around I've found is to put the PS script in a separate pre-commit.ps1 file and modify pre-commit to:\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\npwsh.exe -NoProfile -File .git/hooks/pre-commit.ps1\r\n```\r\nBut I'd rather there be just a single file.  At this point, I'd be satisfied if I could do this:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env pwsh-np\r\n...\r\n```",

All my programs display a lag of 3-4 seconds when starting up. Many applications use `\"$SHELL\" -c <command>` to run external commands, and in each of them PowerShell seems to load the profile, causing the delay (since `$SHELL` is now `/usr/bin/pwsh`). This is particularly noticeable in Neovim and Fzf, as examples.\r\n\r\nPresence of `$Host.IsInteractive` would really help in aborting the sourcing of profile, as in the case of bash.",
