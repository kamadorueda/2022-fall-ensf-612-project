PowerShell internally has many uses for non-default runspaces and it would be good to indicate that when debugging sessions with multiple runspaces.  Note that the original request for this came from a committee member (Jeffrey).  We already provide a runspace name that can be attached to a created runspace.  This is about providing meaningful names for PowerShell internally created runspaces.",
