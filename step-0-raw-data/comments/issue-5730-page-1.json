See @JeremyKuhne's implementation https://github.com/JeremyKuhne/WInterop. Not sure to what extent they can be covered in PowerShell as currently BCL seems to lack some cases.\r\n\r\nNote readlink also resolves the symlink. On Windows soft/hard links and Junctions can be covered by the same semantics?\r\n\r\nWe can also start with simple usecases (without symlinks and UNCs) and then gradually include more features in subsequent releases.",
