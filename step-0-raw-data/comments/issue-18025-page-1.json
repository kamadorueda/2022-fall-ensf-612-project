In Danish the alphabet ends in `Z,Æ,Ø,Å` and in Swedish it ends in `Z,Å,Ä,Ö`. Note how `Å` is used in both alphabets. What should happen if I type in `A..Å`? Do I get the Danish or Swedish alphabet? If you say it depends on the computer language then what should happen when the computer is using an entirely different language like English?  \r\nI think it's best if features like this are consistent, regardless of the system language and while ideally Danish should be the international standard, I think English is a good enough compromise.",
