I wrote about it here \r\nhttps://jamesone111.wordpress.com/2019/11/24/redefining-cd-in-powershell/\r\nAnd in the middle of that there is a statement \"PSReadline caches alias parameters and their associated completers\"  (and I unload and reload PSReadline to work round this). \r\n\r\nIt might be worth raising this with PSReadline folks\r\n\r\n(ps. The title may confuse, because an argumentCompleter specifically fills in parameter *values* and this bit of intellisense is something different) ",
