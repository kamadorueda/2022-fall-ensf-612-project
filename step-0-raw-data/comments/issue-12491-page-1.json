We could update the error message to say that \"blah, blah ... quote arguments starting with '@' blah blah ...\".  As far as \"fixing\" this, I just worry that, given how complex parameter binding already is, adding more special cases could ultimately make things worse, not better. How much of an issue do think this is?",

    "body": "> I assume quoting the argument is all that's needed to make it work\r\n\r\nThat is correct.  It is a fair point to ask if the increased parameter binding complexity is worth it.  As for the question of how much of an issue this is ... that is hard to say but I expect it is more of an issue now that new (Linux/macOS) users are kicking the tires on PowerShell.  The problem is sort of a \"first impression\" issue.  For most folks, their first impression is how well PowerShell does at executing commands from the console.  The command line I listed above was from a training class on Conan.  The first attempt in PowerShell was a failure - not a good first impression.  \r\n\r\nThat said, there are so many of these issues - `;` as a statement sep, `$` for variables `()` for expressions, quoting issues, etc.  Maybe there should be a more holistic approach to all these native app arg issues?  Yes, **I** know about the stop parsing operator but anybody kicking the tires on PowerShell will not.  And there is nothing in the error message that gives the user any help or clue as to how to rectify the situation.  That is not a good user experience.  At the very least, if we detected certain types of parameter errors for a native app, we should offer some suggestions on how to rectify the situation - use `--%` or quote args, etc.  Ideally, in an interactive situation, PowerShell would offer to re-execute the command in a dumb parsing mode.  There are likely a number of other ways to address this to varying degrees.  Most of them are probably better than what we have now.  ",
