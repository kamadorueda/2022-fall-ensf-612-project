    "body": "WG-Engine discussed this today, and the consensus is that this is by design. It may be a little unintuitive that the value behaves like multiple types depending on how it's used, but this is necessary to avoid overcomplicating the command syntax and allowing bare strings that look like numbers to be entered, without losing their original representation if that is desirable.\r\n\r\nThe fix for this is to cast the value to the type you want to treat it as (for example `[int]` in this instance) either in the `param` block or immediately before using it.\r\n\r\nIf we were to remove this behaviour, there would be no way to get it back for the cases that _do_ find this desirable, so our conclusion was that it would be much riskier to change the behaviour than leave it as-is.",
