But PS Core considers any module that is Not in system32 as PS Core-compatible. In other words, any module downloaded from PSGallery by default is considered PS Core-compatible. \r\n`Modules\\AzureAD\\2.0.2.76\\AzureAD.psd1` does not specify `CompatiblePSEditions` and [`get-module AzureAD -ListAvailable` displays that as `PSEdition` == `Desk`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/34f9b43514445a8ceac05794827072b35d0ea577/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/DefaultFormatters/PowerShellCore_format_ps1xml.cs#L1658), which is misleading.

Some basic testing works as expected but have not delved deeply.  Are you meaning ScheduledTasks or PSScheduledTasks? The latter does **not** work.\r\n\r\nThe Scheduled Tasks module is marked as core compatible so loads natively - there is no reason to use the -UseWIndowsPowerShell switch to load the module. \r\n\r\nDNSClient - version 1.0.0.0 and marked as compatible with Core. Built a 2 domain forest, created a second forest, with X-forest trusts, and carried out a wealth of other operations all of which required DNS. Created multiple zones (forward and ptr), RRs etc. I see no issues at all in the Client (or Server0 modules.\r\n\r\nAs this module is marked as core compatible - no need to use the -UseWIndowsPowerShell script.
