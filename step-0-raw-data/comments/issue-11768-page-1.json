    "body": "@daxian-dbw @vexx32 Could the work group discuss this? Specifically whether a PR would be accepted to make the following syntax work:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$memory = [Memory[int]][int[]](0..10)\r\n\r\n# Should return 0\r\n$memory[0]\r\n\r\n# Should set index 0 to 1\r\n$memory[0] = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you can't do this in C# either, in C# you need to access `memory.Span[0]`. Trying to fit that into PowerShell's binder would be very challenging though.  If it is deemed acceptable to fake this indexer, I can provide a PR.",

    "body": "We discussed this in the Engine Working Group last week and had the following thoughts:\r\n\r\n- The request here is for language-level special casing/support for a very specific type\r\n- We don't really have any motivating scenarios described here and generally it's not clear how useful enhanced support of memory types would be for most PowerShell users, compared to just falling back to C#\r\n- There's some concern about handling stack-based value types safely in a language as heap-oriented as PowerShell\r\n- It would probably require significant effort to implement the proposed changes within PowerShell itself, so we'd want to be able to justify that with significant impact\r\n\r\nWith those thoughts in mind, we think handling of memory types is better done with a set of cmdlets in a standalone module than baked into PowerShell and that we should decline this PowerShell feature request.",

One point of clarification:\r\n\r\n> There's some concern about handling stack-based value types safely in a language as heap-oriented as PowerShell\r\n\r\n`Memory<>` is the heap only version of `Span<>`.  The point of the proposed feature is because the intended way to use `Memory<>` is via the `Span` property which is not usable in PowerShell due to it's possibility of being stack based (when not returned from `Memory`).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf anyone else wants this feature they will need to champion it, I will be accepting the WG's decision.",
