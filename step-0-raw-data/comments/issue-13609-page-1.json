Technically it can represent any value between 0 and 65535 (`[UInt16]::MaxValue`) but your character exceeds that size.\r\n\r\nFor example `𩏻` is part of the [CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B](https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/cjk-unified-ideographs-extension-b/) set and the UTF-16 encoded byte value of that is `0x64 0xD8 0xFB 0xDF`. This is known as a surrogate pair in UTF-16.\r\n\r\nYou might consider using the new [Rune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.rune?view=netcore-3.1) type that is designed to handle unicode values. Otherwise we would need to know more about what you are trying to achieve here to help you reach your goal.",
