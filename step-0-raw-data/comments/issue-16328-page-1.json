I'm not sure that's a good reason not to do it.\r\n\r\nIf original proposal is accepted, I don't think the key name should be `.ctor` since most folks won't be familiar with that (or be able to remember it). I don't really have a good alternative in mind though, since anything that doesn't have that problem may be too risky due to potential property name conflicts.\r\n\r\nThe type name might work since most compilers won't let you have a member with the same name as the type that defines it but that may also be too obscure.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMaybe you could also allow this syntax but I'm unsure how I feel about it:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[TestClass]::new(\r\n    'ThirdTest',\r\n    'SomethingElse') @\r\n    {\r\n        Payload = 3\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n \r\n---\r\n\r\n**Edit:** @vexx32 beat me to a response üòÅ. Yeah `::new` is pretty good. Considering that it's much more likely to be implemented than actually building it into the language, that might be the way to go. I'd still like to see it supported in the way that most folks may try to do it intuitively, but it's hard to justify with this alternative.",
