    "body": "The `.ToString()` on `PSCustomObject` explicitly returns an empty string which is pretty much useless.  Having `PSCustomObject.ToString()` do what `PSObject.ToString()` does makes sense. Note - this is a breaking change as there is a slim possibility that people might use `.ToString() -eq ''` to detect `PSCustomObject`.\r\n\r\nFor help objects specifically, which are \"typeless\" `PSCustomObjects`, `Get-Help` could add a script method to each instance it emits along the lines of\r\n```powershell\r\nAdd-Member -Force -InputObject $h ScriptMethod ToString {$this | Out-String }\r\n```\r\nso that `.ToString()` would render the help object as a formatted string.",
