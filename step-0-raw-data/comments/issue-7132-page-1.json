So why should PowerShell Core? If .NET hadn't silently broken this, would we have asked them to or let them?\r\n\r\nIn the real world, attacks exist but so does the usability/security tradeoff. PowerShell already bends over backward trying to manage security boundaries that other applications never contemplate, threading the needle between being able to manage a machine and not being able to do anything bad to it. We have a whole suite of established mechanisms in and around PowerShell to control the power of the user, and I'm not convinced that making this change really enhances that. Factoring in that it's a relatively serious breaking change, I wouldn't endorse it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it's all academic, since the change is already upon us. The question is, what do we do with it?

As described in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7132#issuecomment-501451500, the root cause of the original inconsistent behavior in PowerShell is the inconsistency in returning result of `FileInfo.ToString()`. When invoking `Get-ChildItem` against a directory, it uses `DirectoryInfo.EnumerateFiles()` to get the `FileInfo` objects, which return the file name only when calling `ToString()` on them. When invoking `Get-ChildItem` against files directly, it uses the public constructor `new FileInfo(string fileName)` to create the `FileInfo` objects, which return the full path when calling `ToString()` on them.\r\n\r\nSo to retain the old _wrong_ behavior, we will have to put some hacky code in `FileSystemProvider` to differentiate the `FileInfo` objects generated from `Get-ChildItem <dir>` and `Get-ChildItem <file>` and `Get-Item <file>`. That code would be definitely confusing and I don't think we should do that just in order to retain an unfavorable existing behavior. Since .NET accepted the breaking change by fixing the inconsistency, it's a good chance for us to do the same.",

    "body": "@PowerShell/powershell-committee reviewed this.  The work involved to maintain compatibility is not worth the effort as the underlying platform has introduced a change to fix an inconsistency problem.  This results in a breaking change for some PowerShell users, but detecting of this will be quick and using `.FullName` or `.Name` as appropriate is the right thing to do.  We could make a change in `Join-Path` to support joining two absolute paths to make this simpler for scripts, but that would be a separate issue.",
