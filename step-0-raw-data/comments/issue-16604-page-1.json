    "body": "> I think the issue here is PsReadLine controlling the colours at the console. It certainly hit me - but I just used `Set-PSReadLineOption` to set the colours I need to make the console look better.\r\n\r\nIf he does ` Get-PSReadLineOption` I'll bet he has numbercolor = Escape [97m , but those screen shots show  his console settings are redefining the colour used in 97 to the same as his background.  \r\n\r\nI had to change `operatorcolor` and `parametercolor` from 90 to to 97 because in some of Microsoft's hosts 90 is a bit short of contrast . The old console host, the New Windows Terminal and VSCode all have their own definitions of what (e.g.) Yellow should be \r\n",
