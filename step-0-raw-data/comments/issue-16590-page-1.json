For pwsh today it is appropriate time to migrate Json cmdlets to new .Net Json API so that has more time for user adoption before next LTS release.\r\nAlso we could migrate our code for config file manipulations since .Net Json now support writable DOM.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2020/10/dotnet-bot.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/10/Microsoft-Favicon.png\" height=\"14\"> .NET Blog</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-next-for-system-text-json/\">What's next for System.Text.Json?</a></strong></div><div>Learn about the new performance, reliaility and easy adoption that has been made with System.Text.Json, and whatâ€™s going to come next.</div></blockquote>",
