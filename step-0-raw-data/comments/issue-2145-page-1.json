PowerShell \"smartly\" converts the output into an array of string (with encoding guessed and line-breaks broken). It's worse when your command outputs true \"binary\" stream.\n\nTo use native utilities properly, use `Start-Process` with `RedirectStandard(Input/Output/Error)`.\n\nTo avoid setting an array to a file with CRLF, use `-join` to join them with LF before sending it to `Set-Content` or `Out-File`.\n\nAh, did I mention that you shouldn't use `Set-Content` or `Out-File` if you want to get rid of BOM? Use `[IO.File]::WriteAll(Lines/Text)`.\n",

There needs to be preference variables or some other mechanism to define the default encoding for Out-File (which `>` uses) and in 5.1 and higher you can set `$PSDefaultParameterValues[\"Out-File:Encoding\"] = \"Ascii\"` and Out-File will honor that.  However, that should be set perhaps by default on Linux?  There also needs to be a EOL preference/setting that defaults to just on LF on Linux.  It  would also be nice to see Out-File/Set-Content also get a `-NewLine` parameter that takes CRLF or LF.\n",

Mind you, that writing to a file with `>` is equivalent to piping the object to `Set-Content` (or perhaps `Out-File`, I don't remember which) is **NOT an implementation detail**, it's documented. And again, the corruption of output of a native utility happens *\\* BEFORE*\\* \"redirecting\" to a file.\n\nCould you do the following experiment? I guess you'll understand the idea why current syntax/standard (documentation specified behaviours) won't allow the real \"file redirection\".\n\n``` PowerShell\n# suppose that git command will output more than 2 lines.\n$output = git format-patch HEAD~3\n$output.GetType()\n$output | % { $_.GetType() }\n```\n\nThe second command should give `System.Object[]`. That is, before PowerShell ever writes the file, the stream output by `git` is already lost. As @kumarharsh has shown to us, you have to use `-Encoding UTF8`, why? The reason is again simple. Though `git` outputs in a specific encoding, PowerShell engine reads its `stdout` as string (with encoding guessing), splits it by line, then gives the runtime an `Object[]`. The encoding, the line-ending styles and other possible information have been lost. There is no correct way to recover the encoding, the line-ending character sequence, from that object (array of objects). That's why you have to again specify the encoding.\n\nYou already know one half (encoding), and line-ending character sequence is just the second half, of the OO nature of PS.\n\nI suggest you use `Start-Process` as a workaround and wait for the binary pipe.\n",

After the transformation, no guessing is needed and no encoding information is stored.\n\n#### Long Explanation\n\nThe guessing happens when PowerShell transforms the `stdout` of `git`, it seems PS got this one correct (you have valid strings in memory now). After the transformation, there is no \"encoding\" anywhere -- it's stored as string objects (internally it'll be UTF16 on Windows, I guess CoreCLR uses the same internal encoding). At this point PS has \"forgotten\" the encoding. The default encoding for `Set-Content` or `Out-File` (the one used for \"redirection\") is UTF16LE. You can change this by supplying entries in `$PSDefaultParameterValues`.\n\nThe whole process is:\n1. PS executes `git format-patch HEAD~3`;\n2. PS reads its output stream (`stdout`) as a string;\n3. PS splits the string by line and returns the split result as the value of that invocation.\n\nIf this is still too abstract, let's say that line of `git` outputs\n\n```\nHello\nWorld\nThis is surely not outputed by git.\n```\n\nThen the line is equivalent to\n\n``` PowerShell\n# no encoding information can be seen by Out-File\n@('Hello', 'World', 'This is surely not outputed by git.') |\n    Out-File patch.patch -Encoding utf8\n```\n\nIf you didn't supply `-Encoding utf8`, the encoding defaults to UTF16LE.\n",

    "body": "@GeeLaw One minor correction.  `Set-Content` encoding defaults to `ASCII`.   Also, I believe `>` is syntax sugar for `Out-File` which brings up another issue.  `Out-File` _always_ appends a newline seq to the last string it writes to the file e.g.:\n\n```\n38> 'hello' > foo.txt\n39> fhex foo.txt\n\nAddress:  0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  A  B  C  D  E  F ASCII\n-------- ----------------------------------------------- ----------------\n00000000 FF FE 68 00 65 00 6C 00 6C 00 6F 00 0D 00 0A 00 ..h.e.l.l.o.....\n```\n\nIf you use `Out-File` directly, you can avoid that final newline with the `NoNewline` parameter.  No such luck with `>`.\n\n> the corruption of output of a native utility happens *\\* BEFORE*\\* \"redirecting\" to a file.\n\nYes.  However, I would like to be able to operate on that output **as strings** so it is very useful to have the output of a utility like git converted to string objects (instead of having to deal with a raw byte array - sans encoding info).  Perhaps with PowerShell's ETS magic, strings could carry along their origin encoding info??\n",

You can avoid the newline for `>` by setting `$PSDefaultParameterValues['Out-File:NoNewline'] = $true`. (Just tested on Windows PowerShell 5)\n\nThe idea of operating the output as a string is absolutely great! However, if we change the returning of `git` invocation directly, that'll be a breaking change. With binary pipes, we can receive a `byte[]`, and we can have cmdlets like `Convert-ByteArrayToString [-Encoding ...]`. This will give us full control on interpreting the output of a native utility. Also, the idea of using ETS to record the encoding information on `System.String` is innovative! I'm with you on these.\n",

I had several posts in this thread and couldn't find out which part you are criticising.\r\n\r\nIf I get it correctly, you meant the thing about guessing the encoding? It's already stupid enough to mix two worlds without control over what happens in between -- in the past, the programmer just hopes PowerShell deals the byte stream from/to `string[]` in the way they hoped. Even if you can specify EOL, there are more problems, for example, \"all people speak ASCII\".\r\n\r\nThe cure is the long awaited binary pipe + conversion cmdlets.",
