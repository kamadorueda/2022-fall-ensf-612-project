    "body": "The question was \"I have the cmdlets update a cache every time a cmdlet or completer is called.\". Answer is \" use Get-Command\" - it is only reliable way and we use this (1) to detect PSReadline, (2) in completion subsystem, (3) there are other places.\r\nAnother question about the events of loading and unloading other modules - a description of scenarios is required where one cannot do without it.\r\n",

    "body": "@iSazonov This issue is all about subscribing to module load/unload events in order to perform an action. I may not have been as clear as I wanted but \"I have the cmdlets update a cache every time a cmdlet or completer is called.\" is a workaround to not being able to subscribe to module load/unload events. I have logic in the cmdlet/completer to check which modules have been loaded/unload since the the last time the cache was updated. This wouldn't be necessary if I was able to subscribe to module load/unload events directly.\r\n\r\nI'll update the description to have a better explanation and request to have module load/unload events.",
