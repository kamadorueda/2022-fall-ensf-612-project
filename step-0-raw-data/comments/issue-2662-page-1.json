    "body": "@iSazonov the problem is that `ServicePointManager` affects more than just the web cmdlets and setting it can result in unintended consequences with other functions/cmdlets/modules even for things that are not doing HTTP requests. That kind of permanence may be OK in a scripting scenario, but will be terrifying in a console scenario. In Windows PowerShell this is already a pain.\r\n\r\nOne thing I would like to address for 6.1.0, is session-persistent settings for the web cmdlets only. That way it can be treated more like \"browser\" settings and less like \"platform\" settings. It would include these security protocols and the certificate validation callback (maybe even some predefined callbacks to use).",

For this particular issue, so long as we implement on per-call through `HttpClientHandler.SslProtocols` it should be fine. \r\n\r\nI'm just opposed to tickling other parts of .NET when that behavior is not apparent to the user. Adding session-persistent settings to the web cmdlets is probably too tall an order for 6.0.0. It's tied up with moving to a session persistent `HttpClientHandler` instead of a per-call instance. We would also want to wrap that implementation to handle the inevitable changes in CoreFX. And then we'd need to expose cmdlets for setting them as well as per-cmdlet overrides (different settings for irm vs iwr). \r\n\r\nPoint being, if that ever does get implemented, per-call overrides for these settings would still be acceptable. so we should be able to move forward with this one absent a decision by the committee. But I welcome their feedback anyway.",

We just added 3. How many more?\r\n\r\nThe larger issue is that TLS 1.2 is broken because it still default to TLS 1.0. Users are only having to set TLS settings using `SecurityProtocolType` as a workaround. So, the immediate need is to default to the highest TLS setting supported with proper fallback support . \r\n\r\nSecond scenario are security policies disabling SSL v3 and TLS 1.0. That sounds like a platform level setting to me in that case. If it could pick up the OS defaults, that could make it simpler to make the changes in one place.\r\n\r\nThird scenario would be overrides where things are broken on a site. I think a separate `WebSessionConfiguration` that holds a bunch of settings would be useful here. It keeps the many configuration places in one place and keeps from overloading too many parameters into the web cmdlets themselves.\r\n\r\nOut of all those scenarios, I only see the first one being the most important for 6.0.

This not fluff or feature creep, but the nature of HTTP being filled with bell-end use cases. The average use case is not average at all. If this were an issue requesting support for status 418 \"I'm a teapot\" I would agree. However, forcing the protocol on per-call basis is standard feature of most all CLI web tools.\r\n\r\n> How many more?\r\n\r\nI don't think a slippery slope fallacy is warranted when the web cmdlets already severely lag behind their CLI peers.\r\n\r\n> Second scenario are security policies disabling SSL v3 and TLS 1.0. That sounds like a platform level setting to me in that case. \r\n\r\nWell it depends on if you are working in an environment where you need both because a legacy system does not support new crypto-protocols, but you want to ensure newer protocols for the ones that do use the newer protocols. That's where a per-call setting shines and where a platform setting fails. Then there is the issue of platform settings affecting more than just the web cmdlets and instructing uses to go to .NET settings and change this is inviting disaster for the user.\r\n\r\n> I think a separate WebSessionConfiguration that holds a bunch of settings would be useful here. It keeps the many configuration places in one place and keeps from overloading too many parameters into the web cmdlets themselves.\r\n\r\nI think both have merit. The ability to have per-session settings (which can take the form of per-profile settings though being added to the user's profile) and per-call settings to override them all in addition to the .NET platform settings.\r\n\r\nI think for most users they will look at the available parameters as they are easily discoverable. If they don't see the ability to set the crypto-proto they will likely just use `curl` or `wget` where these are standard features. The Web Cmdlets have a history of being useful only for very basic web tasks because they lack features that many CLI web binaries have. I believe the user base will not only be accepting of more parameters, but are desiring it or expecting it.",

Some of those features would require a complete replacement of `HttpClient` and `HttpClientHandler` (even AngelSharp lacks parity there and they are implementing their own TCP streams). Other features we can combine (for example, the `-CertificateValidationScript` allows for eliminating/combining something like 10 switches on wget...).\r\n\r\nI think it's too late for 6.0.0, but for 6.1.0 we might look at some greater `wget`/`curl` parity and involve that in the greater discussion of how to harmonize per-call and per-session settings for the web cmdlets that do not affect the entire platform.",

Currently, users have no external way of influencing the crypto protocols or certificate validation. `HttpClient` is only affected by settings made to `HttpClientHenlder` and currently the cmdlets are instantiating a new one on every call with no parameters exposed to make this configurable.\r\n\r\nI personally believe the crypto related settings for the web cmdlets to be a somewhat critical feature to have. Our current implementation is either to accept the defaults (which are either too strict or too lenient depending on the context) or to dangerously trust everything and the user has no say in what crypto-proto to use. I have the PR in for the certificate validation. This issue is the other missing component.",

I then used the undesired `ServicePointManager` to validate my `WebListener` test is working property, also verified that that openssl test against  `WebListener` was getting the desired results. \r\n\r\nDigging down the `CoreFX` tree looking for a possible bug there I found [this](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/1ae37add7583acebfa21bbc2074ab627a2f765a7/src/Common/src/System/Net/SecurityProtocol.cs#L11).

Didn't you have something in your test code to determine what TLS version was used from the request? I could not find anything in the ASP.NET Core API to get me the TLS version. I thought I saw something for it in your repo before but when i went looking this morning I didn't see the branch from before.",
