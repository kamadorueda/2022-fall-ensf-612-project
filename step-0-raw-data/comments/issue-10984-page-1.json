Only parameter aliases can guarantee consistent syntax, and commands where it is very common to use that syntax would be better off assigning those aliases so that they do continue to work over time. For the specific scenario mentioned here, we can add a `s` alias for the `-seconds` parameter in `Start-Sleep` if that is a concern.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong...I get the concern -- there is muscle memory to think about. That said though, shorthand parameter names don't always work from version to version because parameters are added to commands over time. I also recognize that this is a common parameter, so more invasive, vs. a command author adding a parameter and thinking to add aliases to support specific shorthand syntax as they add that parameter. The guarantee still isn't there though, unless aliases are used.\r\n\r\n> Second, a common parameter would also not work with non-cmdlet binding functions because common parameters are not added to those functions. I think it would be a mistake to introduce an alternative syntax for splatting that doesn't work everywhere, especially when the incorrect syntax might appear to work silently as is typically the case where `$args` collects the \"extra\" parameters.\r\n\r\nYou're right that this wouldn't work for basic functions. A rule should be added to PSSA to pick up on such things and warn users. If there isn't a rule already to identify when a basic function is passed common parameters, there should be, regardless of what happens with this PR. Your argument about common parameters appearing to work silently with `$args` collecting \"extra\" parameters isn't unique to the proposed `-splat` common parameter. It applies to all common parameters (`-ErrorAction`, `-WarningAction`, etc.). Users who create functions and who want common parameter support need to learn that `CmdletBinding` is required.\r\n",

For example, `Get-Help` has a `-Parameter` parameter. It would be confusing to have both `-Parameter` and `-Parameters` in any cmdlet. OTOH, the `-Splat` name is not likely to result in collision or confusion with other parameter names.\r\n\r\nSince the concept of splatting already needs to be learned, I like the explicit nature of the `-Splat` name, myself. Plus, visibility of that as a word gives users something to search for so that they can learn what it does.",
