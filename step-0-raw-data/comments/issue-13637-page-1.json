    "body": "@SteveL-MSFT: Based on that reply, I'm not sure you understand the pain point. In unattended scripts, logs are important, and warnings and error messages are the most important messages within those logs. If anything is to be displayed in PowerShell as a warning, it should be a result of some significant impact. Some examples:\r\n\r\n* you invoked a command to retrieve users, and you were sent back 1000 users, but there are more users to retrieve, so warn the user that they may not be seeing all records because the command was not invoked to retrieve all records\r\n* you invoked a REST endpoint and your call was redirected, so warn the user about the redirection\r\n\r\nMessages indicating that some cmdlets (that you might care less about -- you're running unattended scripts) come with unapproved verbs does not constitute significant impact when it comes to scripting.\r\n\r\nIt seems you are looking at this through the eyes of an interactive scripting session, where it could be useful to notify users about cmdlets that use non-standard verbs, so that they are more discoverable. `Write-Host` seems appropriate for this, because it's 100% directed towards interactive PowerShell use where you can get a message in your host to tell you about the cmdlets that are not consistent with PowerShell verb recommendations.\r\n\r\nIf the message must stay, my strong recommendation would be twofold:\r\n1. Update the message to call out the specific cmdlets that are using non-standard verbs.\r\n1. Change the target of the message by making it write directly to the host so that it does not pollute any streams. And by this I mean `$host.UI.Write`, not `Write-Host` (that is now written to an information stream). Since this message is only relevant for interactive use, it has no bearing in log files, transcripts, etc., and should never appear in any of them.",

    "body": "> With respect, I disagree with the OP. First and foremost, this is not a bug; the developers intended it as part of the design and I don't see any extenuating circumstances that make this a bug.\r\n> \r\n> Second, this warning is both for the developer and the user. Imagine I import a module called `MpDefinitionPackage`. When it has `New-MpDefinitionPackage`, `Set-MpDefinitionPackage`, `Get-MpDefinitionPackage`, I naturally assume the command for deleting a package is `Remove-MpDefinitionPackage`. I'd be very annoyed if it was called `Delete-MpDefinitionPackage`.\r\n\r\nImagine you don't import your module (because most folks don't...they just invoke commands), and you invoke `Get-MpDefinitionPackage`, and upon doing so you are presented with a warning (or possibly multiple warnings) about cmdlets that you didn't invoke and weren't going to invoke. Those warnings have absolutely nothing to do with your work, and are irrelevant to you.\r\n\r\nNow scale that up to a module containing 100 cmdlets, with only one that uses in incorrect verb. 99 cmdlet invocations could work just fine yet produce a warning for one cmdlet that is an outlier.\r\n\r\nNow consider someone not very well experienced with PowerShell, and when they invoke a cmdlet they get a warning. Not an informational message. A warning. Think about event logs, and how warning, error, and critical messages are usually the ones most relevant to a problem when you are looking at log file. When diagnosing issues after the fact, how does a warning telling you that a cmdlet author made a poor decision when it came to naming a small percentage of their cmdlets, which likely have nothing to do with what you were doing.\r\n\r\nOf course, I do recognize that the information presented in this message _may_ be useful to some folks. But the signal to noise on this message is by far closer to being noise than signal the majority of times that it occurs (especially since once you see it once or twice, it isn't ever necessary to see it again), and having it classified as a warning message is overstepping in this case.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I respect that you disagree @skycommand.",

Regardless, you're pushback seems to be about interactive PowerShell use. I'm not using PowerShell interactively here. In fact, the fact that PowerShell is being used at all is irrelevant to the end user. But warnings and error messages are, or should be, important, because they highlight problems, especially when running scripts unattended when you are reviewing logs. With this functionality implemented the way it is today, the warning is always generated, even in scenarios where it has no place whatsoever, where you do want warnings _about the actual code being executed, not about insignificant command naming that means nothing to someone reviewing a message log_. I have had to make a significant technical investment to silence these warnings in my product, so I logged this issue because that investment should not have been necessary, and it would be better for the PowerShell community if these warnings were only presented during interactive sessions, if at all. I stand by the opinion that this message is misdirected: it should be for the author), and there are far better ways to communicate such a message. See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13637#issuecomment-694260675.\r\n\r\nIf you had asked questions about this instead of pushing back without understanding why I logged this issue in the first place, we could have a productive discussion about the problem. Instead, your communication makes you come across as a gatekeeper getting in the way of something that truly does need improvement.",

In their script module, which makes a connection to Exchange and imports cmdlets from that remote session, they explicitly use `-DisableNameChecking` internally, so no matter how much anyone might like to be aware that they are exporting commands with non-approved verbs (they have commands with the verbs `Delete`, `Preview`, `Release`, `Rotate`, `Troubleshoot`, `Upgrade` and `Validate`), they're just quietly hiding that detail and avoiding the public shaming that this warning was intended to call out, and there's nothing really stopping others from designing modules that do the same.\r\n\r\nThis is a clear failure.
