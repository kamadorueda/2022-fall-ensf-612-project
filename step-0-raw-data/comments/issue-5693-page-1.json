    "body": "Yes, *very* surprising. I think this can make using 3rd-party modules (that set $ErrorActionPreference) harder to use. In my case, the caller and the function setting $ErrorActionPreference were on different modules, with a call stack about 5 levels deep. It was very surprising to add a try catch around a function in one module, and see errors popping out apparently from nowhere. I knew the section of our code that sets $ErrorActionPreference to 'SilentlyIgnore' (we have legacy code that produces known errors that can be ignored) so it was easy to understand what was happening. When using 3rd-party modules this could be a lot harder.",
