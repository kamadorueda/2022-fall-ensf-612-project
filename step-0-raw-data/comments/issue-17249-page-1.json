    "body": "In 7.2.1 the default for `$PSStyle.OutputRendering`  was changed from `host`  (which had a reported theoretical security issue) to `ansi`. \r\nAnsi sequences are now added to all table headers - even if you set the style to no coloring in a reset code is still sent -  \r\n and the change of default means they are not removed when output is sent to a file, to the clipboard etc, resulting in \"Ansi corrupted\" output.  There are multiple issues about different forms of this .\r\n\r\nAs I understand it @SteveL-MSFT  made a change to fix the \"security issue\" which went into 7.2.2 but as of 7.2.3 the default has not reverted, so PowerShell is still not sending clean data. The work round is to set \r\n`$PSStyle.OutputRendering = \"Host\"`    \r\nor    \r\n`$PSStyle.OutputRendering = \"PlainText\"`\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT   is there a plan to change the default back to host ? \r\n\r\n",
