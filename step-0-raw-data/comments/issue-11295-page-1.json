    "body": "It isn't PowerShell that parses the argument as an array, it is _cmd_ that interprets unquoted token `a,b` as _two_ arguments, because not only _spaces_ but also `,` and `;` can serve as argument separators.\r\n\r\nPowerShell performs re-quoting as needed behind the scenes, and in the absence of _spaces_ inside arguments, it currently decides that enclosing the value in double quotes is _not_ necessary, so that both `.\\mybatch.cmd \"a,b\"` and `.\\mybatch.cmd 'a,b'` end up getting called as `.\\mybatch.cmd a,b`, at which point cmd considers `a` and `b` separate arguments.\r\n\r\nThis re-quoting logic does not special-case calling `cmd.exe` or batch files, and is currently generally broken - see #1995 \r\n\r\n**The workaround is to use _embedded_ double quoting**:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n.\\mybatch.cmd '\"a,b\"'\r\n.\\mybatch.cmd \"`\"a,b`\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can use the `iep` function defined [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1995#issuecomment-562334606) to automate this quoting  and to compensate for the other ways in which re-quoting is broken.\r\n\r\nNote that the planned fix for #1995, detailed in [this RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/90), will _break_ the workaround (as it will break all other current workarounds) and - unless `cmd.exe` / batch-file calls are special-cased - would offer no alternative (other than the limited `--%` approach) - see [this comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/90#issuecomment-552231174).",
