    "body": "On Windows, it's common to use an extension, e.g. `gsn.exe`, but obviously that won't help on Linux.\n\nA full path (or relative path) is the most obvious way to invoke an external command, but we do have a syntax (admittedly obscure) if you don't know the path:\n\n``` powershell\n& (Get-Command -CommandType Application gsn)\n```\n\nThe `&` operator is the invocation operator - which is more often used to invoke commands with spaces in the path or to execute a command whose name is in a variable. In my example above, because of strong typing, the invocation operator recognizes the output of Get-Command (an instance of something deriving from `System.Management.Automation.CommandInfo`) and correctly calls that command, allowing you to override the default command resolution algorithm.\n\nThat said, I agree a better syntax is needed for Linux.\n",
