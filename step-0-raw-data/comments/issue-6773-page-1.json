    "body": "How about allowing an initial `:` to represent the current location's drive, without having to name it in full?\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# While the current location is on drive steve:, this would be the \r\n# equivalent of Set-Location steve:/Users\r\nSet-Location :/Users   \r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words: start a path with `:/` rather than just `/` if you want it to refer to the root of the current drive.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe small caveat is that on Unix-like platforms it would take away the ability to directly target a subdir. literally named `:`, which currently works:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> mkdir -p ':/Users'; Set-Location -LiteralPath ':/Users'; $pwd.Path\r\n/Users/jdoe/:/Users\r\n```\r\nTo truly target a subdir. named `:` in this case, prefixing with `./` would then be required (`Set-Location ./:/Users`)\r\n\r\nI don't think that's a real-world concern, however, especially given that this is already a problem with files / subdirs. whose names _look_ like they start with a drive spec; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> mkdir -p 'ab:cd'; Set-Location -LiteralPath 'ab:cd'\r\nSet-Location : Cannot find drive. A drive with the name 'ab' does not exist.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this scenario prefixing with `./` already _is_ a requirement.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nGiven the rarity of `:` in filenames, I think introducing support for `:/` is an acceptable solution.\r\n\r\n(Note that `:` serves as the entry separator in `$env:PATH` on Unix-like platforms, even though `:` is a legal filename character in the typical Linux / macOS filesystems.\r\nOn a side note: classic Mac OS used `:` as the path separator, and that heritage is still reflected in Finder, which translates `:` in filenames into `/`(!) in its GUI.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
