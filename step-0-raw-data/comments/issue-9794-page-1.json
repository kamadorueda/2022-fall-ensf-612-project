    "body": "@daxian-dbw Given how PowerShell handles conversions from null -> string (yielding `string.Empty` if I'm not mistaken) it may not make sense to also handle `NullString.Value` as a true `null` here as well -- either that or I need to be more careful with the handling in the string conversion paths so that a null string is a valid result when given a \"null\" value.\r\n\r\nSee the failing tests, where it expects empty string because the class definition has a `[string]`-type property and it is converting \"expected\" values into empty strings as a result here.\r\n\r\nWhat would be appropriate here, do you think?\r\n\r\nEDIT: Looks like `FigureConversion()` just needs to keep track that the original type was in fact `NullString` so that the conversion paths do their thing correctly. Verified that the tests seem to pass locally with this fix. ðŸ™‚ ",

I'm also not really sure there's _really_ value in having them all not equal each other. If each individually should be treated as \"equal to\" a true null for our purposes, then logically it makes the most sense to have them \"equal\" each other as well when tested in this manner.\r\n\r\nAfter all, if you _really_ wanted to check the \"type\" of the null value... we can still do `$value -is [dbnull]` and so forth, and get definitive results.\r\n\r\nWould appreciate your thoughts here. ðŸ™‚ ",

Yes, `[AutomationNull]::Value` is supposed to behave just like `$null` with the only difference that `$null` can be passed through pipeline while `[AutomationNull]::Value` cannot.\r\nGiven that, I think it makes sense to have `[AutomationNull]::Value -eq [DBNull]::Value` returning `$true` (the same to `[AutomationNull]::Value -eq [NullString]::Value`).\r\n@mklement0 Do you have any concerns?",

Not sure exactly where that would need to be done, but I can take a look in a day or two :)\r\n\r\n@vexx32 I suggest you to not work on supporting this in this PR. I'm not really sure we want to do that because it could cause confusion semantically -- `[AutomationNull]::Value` is treated as null in PowerShell (e.g. `[AutomationNull]::Value.GetType()` fails because it's not considered as an object), The current behavior is consistent and makes sense.",

They should be the same, only with on difference that should be meaningful only to the engine -- `[AutomationNull]::Value` means not passing along the pipeline while `$null` does.\r\n\r\n@vexx32 Thanks for showing that example (I didn't know it before :)). The comments you put in the code snippet are reversed though, `$null -is [psobject]` returns `false` and the other one returns `true`.\r\nYes, that's inconsistent, and how to fix that (if we want to) depends on how we want to treat `[AutomationNull]::Value` -- more of an implementation detail, or something that makes sense for users to depend on and be able to tell.",

    "body": "> @vexx32 Thanks for showing that example (I didn't know it before :)). The comment you put in the code snippet are reversed though, `$null -is [psobject]` returns `false` and the other one returns `true`.\r\n> Yes, that's inconsistent, and how to fix that (if we want to) depends on how we want to treat `[AutomationNull]::Value` -- more of an implementation detail, or something that makes sense for users to depend on the be able to tell.\r\n\r\nIdeally if this were to be fixed it would just be removed from assignment, e.g. `$obj = [AutomationNull]::Value` would populate `$obj` with true `null`.  The `-is` operator is one of the few things that never \"lie\" on occasion and I think it would be a detriment to change that.\r\n\r\nYou can also make `[AutomationNull]::Value -is [AutomationNull]` work by:\r\n\r\n1. Removing the `static` keyword from the class decl\r\n1. Make it inherit `PSObject`\r\n1. Change the singleton instance to `new AutomationNull()`\r\n\r\nThat would allow `$autoNull -is [psobject]` to still work while enabling `$autoNull -is [AutomationNull]`.  Though I think there are a few places in the compiler where it uses a pattern like `if (expr.ExpressionType == typeof(PSObject) && expr.Value == AutomationNull.Value)` so that might need to change.",
