However there will be many things out there which look like this \r\n\r\n```powershell \r\nfunction myfn  {\r\n    param (\r\n        #omit for current directory\r\n        [String]$MyPathParmeter\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    # blah blah blah \r\n    Get-ChildItem $MyPathParameter\r\n# blah blah blah\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBy not rejecting null/empty values Get-ChildItem saves whoever writes that script from having to either default `$MyPathParmeter` to $pwd, or change how Get-ChildItem is called depending on whether the parameter is passed.  I would expect many scripts to rely on this behaviour.  \r\nOf course if the line is   `Get-ChildItem $MyPathParameter | remove-item`  the way of working we have requires the script author to check that the value isn't null or empty. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Of course only Get-Childitem works with no path. \r\n\r\nGet-ChildItem  _could_ have been designed to reject null or empty, but it wasn't. And over the last 15 years a decent number of scripts have been written which depend on the present behaviour. So this is breaking change where the benefit is small. (@MartinGC94  we can argue how big the number is but the example I gave of one natural way to write it - i.e. not splatting ps bound params will pass an empty string if the parameter is not specified, and so will be break if empty is rejected, so I think its a breaking change which would have quite a wide effect)\r\n \r\n\r\n",

It's also _mostly_ a non-issue; it's fairly trivial to do one's own validation in a script before calling Get-ChildItem in most cases, either with an if statement or a Where-Object in a pipeline to discard or otherwise ignore null values.\r\n\r\nWe understand the discomfort for inconsistency and occasional confusion this behaviour can sometimes cause, but our consensus is that the benefit from the change here isn't compelling enough for this breaking change to be acceptable.",
