PowerShell's stream concepts don't map _super_ well externally where you only really have stdout and stderr to work with, though; there's only so many ways you can condense 6 streams down to 2, and you'll always be losing out somewhere, so oftentimes it's mainly a matter of making the best of it.",

In Powershell today, there's no way to emit debugging output while simultaneously pipelining `pwsh` with POSIX-native tooling. That leads to very awkward shims, and a general loss of debugging data streams.\r\n\r\nIdeally, an invocation of `pwsh` would at minimum permit specifying file descriptors to map the event streams to, to let the plumbing get wired in to user expectations.",
