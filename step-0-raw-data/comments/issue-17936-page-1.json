    "body": "Regarding 1 and 2: Naturally the example I gave was not from a useful `.bat` script.  It was a simplification of a real-world script, which looks more like this:\r\n```bat\r\nREM some argument parsing before this\r\nIF [\"%ARG%\"] == [\"xyz\"] (\r\n    FOR %%T IN (dir1, dir2, dir3) DO (\r\n        (pushd %%T && CALL build.bat %REST% && popd) || EXIT /B 1\r\n    )\r\n    EXIT /B 0\r\n)\r\nREM some other cases after this\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo you see, in this case the `EXIT /B 1` is a way to exit the script early in case one of the loop iterations fails.  Even though there are no \"extra commands\" after that exit, it still returns `$LASTEXITCODE` 0.\r\n\r\nRegarding 3 and 4: Perhaps there is some reason why powershell returns exit code 0 from `(exit 1; Write-Output 'aa')`.  It seems surprising to me, since my understanding is that `exit 1` should set the exit code and also stop the script.  So I don't see why the presence of commands that aren't run would \"clear\" the exit code.  Maybe it would be worth mentioning in [the documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_language_keywords?view=powershell-7.2&viewFallbackFrom=powershell-6#exit).\r\n",

It then sets lastexitcode to the exit code the `cmd.exe` process.\r\n\r\nI tested in `cmd` and confirmed that while the command `test.bat` returns errorlevel 1, `cmd /c test.bat` returns errorlevel 0!  As described before that discrepancy happens only when there are additional commands in a code block after the `exit /b`.\r\n\r\nSo it seems the conclusion here is that if this is a bug, it is a bug in `cmd.exe` and not in PowerShell.",
