It would be confusing to see Windows PowerShell when looking for PS7 settings and also new settings for PS7 may come up that wouldn't apply to WinPS5.1.  For PS7, we need a separate admx, and we should have an option per setting to \"Use Windows PowerShell Policy\" so that users can set it for WinPS5.1 and have it respected by PS7.  However, if WinPS5.1 ever gets removed, then PS7 policy would be equivalent to not set so could be problematic.  Request is to have RFC authored for this.",
