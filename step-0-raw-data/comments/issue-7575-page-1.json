I need to expand the tests and organise them a bit regardless, but as long as I don't add cases for the `short` or `ushort` type-d literal tests we should be fine. (Multipliers above `kb` will fail if applied to `(u)short` values because they are outside the value range of those data types.)\r\n\r\nBut isn't programmatically creating the tests like this going to yield only results that are self-consistent? If I changed the parser to behave in an unexpected way, it's going to parse the same for calculating the test as it will for actually testing the value. It's just checking its own work at that point, without us being able to actually check it properly.",

I think it is very useful if we plan add new custom ToInt()-like methods (without throw). It allow us to check all edge cases (overflows). We could add new parameter \"ExpectedThrow\" in the test.",
