Keywords have a really nice no-nonsense simplicity about them that can be really nice to work with. Cmdlets can tend towards feature creep, among other things, and tend to be a bit slower to operate.\r\n\r\nI'm not really sure which approach is really better.

I suspect this is due to the fact that there really haven't a been lot of scenarios where you _need_ it in PowerShell and the few where it's required can be handled with try/finally. Otherwise the pipeline/cmdlets take care of disposing the resources for you. As a consequence, it has been hard to sustain much energy around this issue. I'm not against the idea (in fact I was quite keen on it at one point) but currently it's just kind of meh. So if you have some new scenarios where `using` is critical, please share them. Thanks!",

I think the lack of decent `using` solution makes streams in PS awkward and discourages their use. I'm a HUGE fan of streams and have always felt they are a missed opportunity in PS. I have used them heavily in PHP, C#, and Python. Because they are clunky in PS, I will either `Add-Type` some C# in or write a library in C# to handle it for me. In a pinch I can use a try/finally, but it starts to get unruly and painful to read when you have multiple `IDisposable`s to work with at once.\r\n\r\nhere's an example from an earlier issue:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-RemoteCertificate {\r\n  [CmdletBinding()]\r\n  [OutputType([System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate])]\r\n  param (\r\n    [Parameter(\r\n      Mandatory,\r\n      ValueFromPipeline\r\n    )]\r\n    [ValidateNotNull()]\r\n    [Uri]\r\n    $Uri\r\n  )\r\n  process {\r\n    try {\r\n      $TcpClient = [System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient]::new($Uri.Host, $Uri.Port)\r\n      try {\r\n        $SslStream = [System.Net.Security.SslStream]::new($TcpClient.GetStream())\r\n        $SslStream.AuthenticateAsClient($Uri.Host)\r\n        $SslStream.RemoteCertificate\r\n      } finally {\r\n        $SslStream.Dispose()\r\n      }\r\n    } finally {\r\n      $TcpClient.Dispose()\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",

    "body": "@markekraus \r\n\r\n> Does a finally block run in a cmdlet/function even in the case of a pipeline stop exception?\r\n\r\nYes, with some caveats.  If you place the assignment inside the `try`, there could be an exception or stop prior to the assignment.  If this happens in the `try`, the `finally` could still fire, potentially calling `Dispose` on an object from a previous scope.  If you place the assignment outside the `try`, a stop could occur before getting to the `try` block.\r\n\r\nSo I've taken to a pattern like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$client = $null\r\ntry {\r\n    $client = [TcpClient]::new($uri.Host, $uri.Port)\r\n} finally {\r\n    if ($null -ne $client) {\r\n        $client.Dispose()\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's not pretty, but it's safe.",
