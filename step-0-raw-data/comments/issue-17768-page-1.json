    "body": "The first example shows that the process is not checking for external programs, which is something which should also be addressed.\r\n\r\nThis is an experimental feature which some people may prefer to leave disabled - in the case of simple typing errors we (probably) know we mean \"git\" or \"Get-PSResource\" - some people may want the current one line version and some may want the full details. So this should be an option and so should the one line version. (since the feature is still experimental, the default can be discussed) . \r\n\r\nAt present the alias is an issue. I know that  `fl` / `ft` / `fw`  are `format-List / Table / Wide` and I know there is a `format-hex` command so I try this \r\n```\r\n type .\\deleteme.txt | fh\r\nfh: The term 'fh' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [4,General]: The most similar commands are: fl, ft, fw, oh, fc, fhx, F:, h.\r\n```\r\n\r\n`h` _might_  be the alias, so might `oh` , `fc` doesn't look likely and I can eliminate fl/ft/fw and f: but nothing is making fhx jump out  and I might need to spend longer looking at the list thing \"It OH for out-hex ? no that's `Out-host`  H for Hex ? No that's `history` \" and so on   \r\n\r\nSome aliases don't have their source (fc / fl / ft for example) and some  don't show where they go until the module is loaded (fimo for example): \r\n```\r\nPS>  get-command -type Alias -Name f*\r\n\r\nCommandType     Name                                               Version    Source\r\n-----------     ----                                               -------    ------\r\nAlias           fc -> Format-Custom\r\nAlias           fhx -> Format-Hex                                  7.0.0.0    Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\r\nAlias           fimo ->                                            2.2.5      PowerShellGet\r\nAlias           fimo ->                                            2.2.5      PowerShellGet\r\nAlias           fimo ->                                            1.0.0.1    PowerShellGet\r\nAlias           Find-SeElement                                     3.0.1      Selenium\r\nAlias           fl -> Format-List\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince I mention fimo , fm doesn't find it \r\n```\r\nPS>  fm\r\nfm: The term 'fm' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [4,General]: The most similar commands are: fl, ft, fw, gm, rm, fc, F:, %, ?, cp.\r\n```\r\n\r\nLike fh it would help the search if the logic says F  &  H  or F & M might be the first letters of the full command \r\nso if we find an alias for something where the canonical name is f*-h* or  f*-m*  those are good matches. It's not likely that I want % ? or cp when I typed fm. \r\n\r\n So there is work to do before this feature comes out of experimental status. \r\n",
