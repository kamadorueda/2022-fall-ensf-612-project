I agree that it is PowerShell issue.\r\nPerhaps we should ask a more general question -see #1273 and #7221 last comment) - how much should we be case-sensitive/-insensitive on every platform?\r\n\r\n- on Windows, API preserves case but all comparisions is case-insensitive. PowerShell follow this.\r\n- on MacOs, API preserves case but all comparisions is case-insensitive. Currently PowerShell doesn't follow this. Bug? Should? I think yes.\r\n- on Linux, API preserves case and all comparisions is case-sensitive. PowerShell follow this. Here is the quesion - how much should we be case-sensitive on Linux taking #1273 into consideration? Perhaps we could be case-insensitive on Linux in other scenarios too. \r\nFor example, if a user accidentally types `dir /Etc` we could test that `/Etc` doesn't exists and then try `/etc` - is the behavior acceptable for Linux users? If yes, we could easily resolve the Issue and  #1273 in that way I suggested in  #7221.",

    "body": "@iSazonov: Please see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5678#issuecomment-418155458 above.\r\n\r\nIn short: \r\n\r\n* I think _literal_ names should never be automatically case-corrected on case-sensitive filesystems, to avoid ambiguity.\r\n\r\n* It makes sense to offer case-_insensitivity_ for (a) tab-completion and (b) filename globbing, but I wonder if it should require an _explicit opt-in_ (perhaps via preference variables), at least for _globbing_.\r\n\r\n   * Otherwise, users may be surprised if `Get-Item test` doesn't find `.\\Test`, but `Get-Item test*` does, for instance.\r\n\r\n  * For ad-hoc use (as well as for [internal use in generating completions](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1273#issuecomment-320696245)), adding a `-CaseInsensitive` switch to `Resolve-Path` does make sense.\r\n\r\nThat said, as stated in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1273#issuecomment-324398879, the tricky thing is that a preference variable that controls globbing case-sensitivity, if set in the global scope, would potentially change the behavior of all _scripts_ run in-process, unless they explicit set the preference variable to the default in their scope.\r\n\r\nGiven that, perhaps the answer is to:\r\n\r\n* categorically use case-_insensitive_ globbing (and tab-completion) on all platforms, even on Linux.\r\n\r\n* offer case-_sensitive_ globbing, if desired, _only_:\r\n  * via the filesystem provider's `-Filter` parameter (though that could be confusing) \r\n  * via a `-CaseSensitive` (sic) switch added to `Resolve-Path` - for consistency, that switch would then have to be honored on Windows and macOS too, however (just documenting it as being ignored on these platform may not be enough to avoid confusion).\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "There ultimately is no _good_ solution here, but what appeals to me about the latter solution is its simplicity:\r\n\r\n* As a user, all you need to remember is that PowerShell wildcards are case-_insensitive_ _everywhere_ by default.\r\n\r\n  * Getting case-_sensitive_ filename globbing, if needed (probably rarely), must be requested explicitly with `-Resolve-Path -CaseSensitive` and _perhaps_ also the filesystem provider's `-Filter` parameter.\r\n    * I'm starting to think that the latter is not a good idea, though: on the one hand, there already are differences between `-Filter` and PS wildcards on Windows, but they are subtle and don't affect the majority use cases; on the other hand, `-Filter` is often used for _performance_ reasons alone, and having it be case-sensitive is then an inconvenience at best, and a subtle source of bugs at worst.\r\n\r\n* No new preference variables and therefore no associated issues with global state (\"convention over configuration\").\r\n\r\nObviously, the behavior would need documenting in [about_wildcards](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_wildcards).",
