Running in this mode is likely to be slow (or slower) but reloading is guaranteed. (Note: this is the solution that the DSC team settled on years ago.)",

It would be a good idea though when this is implemented to have it automatically reload submodules as well, or else implement both `-Force` and `-Recurse` switches from the start so that you don't end up with a new issue similar to #2505, but for `using module` instead of `Import-Module`.",

Add in the `-Force` (and `-Recurse` if that gets added to `Import-Module`) so they can be used natively/explicitly, but also add in a dev-mode flag that would implicitly provide those parameters even if you don't provide them. The reason I mention having both is I imagine there will be other changes people would expect dev-mode to toggle on, such as providing `-Force` and `-Recurse` whenever `Import-Module` is called, and I'm sure there would be some people upset if certain things could _only_ be enabled by having the dev-mode toggle turned on; e.g. there might be a reason why people want to use `using module ... -Force` in production code without also turning on all of the other things that dev-mode might turn on.\r\n\r\nHaving a dev-mode toggle that simply sets some defaults like that would be nice, but I think the scope of that request is beyond this issue. Plus, if all of the options are available to set natively/explicitly, then we wouldn't need to rely on the PowerShell team to provide the dev-mode toggle. Anybody would be able to write their own \"dev-mode\" module that could be imported and simply hides the native cmdlets and exposes theirs instead, where there's simply delegate the work to the native cmdlets, but with additional parameters provided (e.g. the decorator pattern).\r\n\r\nFor those reasons, I would still propose simply adding `-Force` (and `-Recurse` if needed) to `using module`. Dev-mode could be it's own new feature request, since it would apply to many more cmdlets than just `using module`.",

    "body": "@deadlydog  Some context: `using module` and `Import-Module` are two very different things. The `using` statement is part of the PowerShell language, just like `if`, `while` etc. Characteristically keywords do not take parameters (with a few exceptions e.g. `switch -regex` (which was a mistake - sorry - it seemed like a good idea at the time)). `Import-Module`, on the other hand, is \"just\" a cmdlet and so, like all cmdlets, it takes parameters. Behaviorally, keywords are processed once at parse time. This is why you have to use `using` when importing a class definition that you are deriving from. Cmdlets are processed at runtime and are evaluated each time they are encountered during script execution. So you can, for example, put `Import-Module` in a loop like:\r\n```powershell\r\nforeach ($m in 'module1\", \"module2\", \"module3\") { Import-Module $m }\r\n```\r\nwhereas `using` statements have to be the first non-comment lines in a compile unit (script) and will be executed only once when the compile unit is parsed. This is important to why we don't want parameters on keywords. In PowerShell, parameters take arguments that are evaluated at runtime e.g. `Import-Module -force:$foo bar`. Keywords are processed at parse time and so can only take constant arguments (usually no arguments at all). For example `switch` takes `-regex` so you can write\r\n```powershell\r\nswitch -regex ('aaa') { a+ {'Eh!'} b+ {\"Bee!\"}}\r\n```\r\nbut you can't write\r\n```powershell\r\nswitch -regex:$foo ('aaa') { a+ {'Eh!'} b+ {\"Bee!\"}}\r\n```\r\nbecause `switch` is processed entirely at parse time.\r\n\r\nSo in summary, `using namespace` is a keyword and keywords, as a rule, don't take parameters. And even if they had parameters the behavior would be inconsistent with cmdlets. \r\n\r\nAnother point to consider is that much of the time, people don't explicitly import modules, they let the autoloader do it. How do you pass a switch to the autoloader? Dev-mode fixes that.\r\n\r\n> Having a dev-mode toggle that simply sets some defaults like that would be nice, but I think the scope of that request is beyond this issue. Plus, if all of the options are available to set natively/explicitly, then we wouldn't need to rely on the PowerShell team to provide the dev-mode toggle.\r\n\r\nSince, per the above, we are talking about making changes to the PowerShell language, either way, dev-mode or -force require changes to be made to the core engine, typically (but no longer exclusively) the domain of the PowerShell team. (Also, don't confuse _dev-mode_ with _strict-mode_. The types of behaviours defined by strict mode are definitely something you'd want to leave on in production. On the other hand, dev-mode - forcing modules to be reloaded every time - will be a significant performance hit that you would definitely _not_ want in production.)\r\n\r\nFinally, you can use `$PSDefaultParameterValues` to make module imports `-Force` by default, so sort of a dev-mode switch:\r\n```powershell\r\n$PSDefaultParameterValues.\"Import-Module:Force\" = $true\r\n```\r\n",

    "body": "Thanks for the explanation and clarification @BrucePay 👍  I hadn't considered that `using` was a language keyword while `Import-Module` was a cmdlet, and as such the two adhere to different rules/conventions. Given that and what you mentioned above, the `dev-mode` flag makes more sense than adding `-Force` parameters.\r\n\r\nSo I guess I see 3 potential ways to go here:\r\n1. Introduce a new dev-mode flag as previously described.\r\n2. Simply change the existing `using` statement to automatically reload modules; I _think_ that would be backward compatible, but if it would incur a performance hit at run-time that's probably not the way to go.\r\n3. Introduce a new language keyword (e.g. `using reloaded module` or some such thing) that removes the module before loading it.\r\n\r\nOf those options, if it's possible and doesn't introduce any backward compatibility issues or performance costs then I think 2. would be the way to go. Otherwise, the dev-mode flag may be the best 🙂",
