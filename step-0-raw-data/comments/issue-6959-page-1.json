    "body": "@iSazonov: \r\n\r\nThe linked issue - #6946 - discusses a fix.\r\n\r\nIn short: \r\n\r\nIf we didn't have a backward-compatibility concern, my vote would definitely be to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that for backward compatibility we must retain the behavior of at least _first_ attempting to interpret a property name / hashtable key that starts with a digit as an _expression_, for the sake of accessing hashtables with numeric keys.\r\n\r\nA real-world example is `$Matches.0` to access the hashtable entry with _integer_ key `0`.\r\n\r\nWe could _fall back_ to string interpretation if the expression turns out not to be valid, however; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Examples of surprising behaviors we CANNOT change:\r\n$obj.1e2  # 1e2 is interpreted as [double] 100, so as a *property* access this is the same as: $obj.'100'\r\n$obj.1d # -> $obj.'1'\r\n$obj.1l # -> $obj.'1'\r\n$obj.1kb # -> $obj.'1024'\r\n\r\n# This we could fix by falling back to string, because 1a is not valid as an expression.\r\n$obj.1a  \r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven that there are cases where unexpected numeric interpretation can kick in, which results in _quiet_ failure (relative to the user's intent), the question is whether implementing fall-back-to-string behavior is ultimately more confusing than helpful:\r\n\r\nIn the absence of knowing the underlying logic, it would be hard to _infer_ what's going on; e.g., with fall-back-to-string in place, the user may be puzzled why `.1a` works, but `.1d` doesn't (in the sense of `.'1d'`).\r\n\r\nProviding guidance via the error message - i.e., use _quoting_ if you want to force interpretation as a _string_ - ultimately promotes safer habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
