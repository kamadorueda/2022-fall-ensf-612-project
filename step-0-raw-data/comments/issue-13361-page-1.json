That's a very important use case.\r\n\r\nI'm curious how this is done today in console before this PR? In console, unless we redirect the stderr stream, the message written to stderr from the native command will always handled by the console (print on console).\r\n\r\n> Maybe this is solved in conjunction with #3415, e.g. the stderr output would be available on the exception object?\r\n\r\nThe discussion on it so far is that the exception only has the exit code, not the content from stderr.\r\nThe idea is: many native commands write to stderr not as error messages, but an alternate stream for additional information that doesn't make sense to write to stdout. This includes content such as verbose or progress output.\r\nBut that can be further discussed in #3415.",
