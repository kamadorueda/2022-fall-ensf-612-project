The property you mentioned needs to be set in the project file itself before compiling the project, so you'd need to, build pwsh from source with the property set to workaround it if you want to use the API this way from PowerShell at the moment.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure what the possible side effects from setting that flag in a project may be, so I don't know whether it's feasible to have PowerShell set that flag then it is built normally.",
