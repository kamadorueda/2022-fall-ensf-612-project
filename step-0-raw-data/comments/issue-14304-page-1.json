    "body": "Eh, I've always said that MSFT developers shouldn't be given the latest hardware :-)\r\nWhen I started #14268 my first desire was to follow the EarlyStartup.Init() pattern and move slow operations to background threads but after testing on my old laptop, I did not see any performance gain.\r\nFrom this I concluded that this approach is not well applicable if we want to be fast on high-load systems and  low-power equipment (IoT, Wasm and so on).\r\n(We already create many _CPU-bound_ threads and adding new ones only makes sense for hardware with many cores - this is definitely not my laptop :-) )\r\nSo I did some PRs with _direct_ performance improvements. @daxian-dbw Could you please consider them first? Even if we decide to move some from them to background threads, it will make them also lighter and faster.\r\n\r\nI especially have doubts about GetPolicySetting(). It is slow totally because of newtonsoft.json. It would be more promising for us to migrate to .Net Json and see the result. It will _definitely_ be better. If we see problems we can ask the .Net team, which continues to actively work on it.\r\n\r\n(Perhaps we need take new look on EarlyStartup.Init().)\r\n",

From my experience Windows works well on 2 cores (including applications) and I guess we will see the same result for our test on more slow hardware.\r\nI say about (1) roadmap and (2) how many benefits we will get from parallelization in the startup scenario. \r\nIt is well known that replacing a bad algorithm with a better one can have the greatest effect. Also, direct fixes are generally more effective than workarounds. For example, in our case, we can get a benefit of 20% from direct fixes, and from the subsequent parallelization only 1%, even on fast equipment because the code is already fast.\r\nSo my suggestion for a roadmap is to work on direct fixes here and in other repositories before RC and then investigate parallelization.\r\nThis will simplify the final performance checks before 7.2 release.\r\n",

    "body": "Don't think parallelization as a workaround, think it as a tool. There is no good or bad about a tool, but only right way or wrong way to use it. As I said [above](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14304#issuecomment-737460646), the right way is _\"be careful about the **number of threads** you spin up and be careful about what **work loads** to process in parallel, so as to avoid contention/blocking as much as possible.\"_\r\n\r\nAn example as to the **work load** aspect:\r\n\r\n1. Today, `DefaultInitialSessionState = CreateDefault2()` is called in `ManagedEntrance.Start`, but the created `InitialSessionState` instance is not used until in `DoCreateRunspace`. I did some measurement on my \"_latest_\" machine, `CreateDefault2()` taske ~36 ms, and then it takes ~40 ms for the code flow to reach the first use of `DefaultInitialSessionState` in `DoCreateRunspace`.\r\n\r\n 2. Meanwhile, the `CreateDefault2()` call is pretty selfcontained, no synchronization is needed when having it run on a worker thread. \r\n\r\nTogether, they make `CreateDefault2()` a good candidate work-load to run as a task, as of today.\r\n\r\n> For example, in our case, we can get a benefit of 20% from direct fixes, and from the subsequent parallelization only 1%, even on fast equipment because the code is already fast.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like a pretty extragerated hypothetical example :) But, if we cannot find the right workload for parallelization, then that just means we should not use that tool.\r\n\r\nI want to emphsize again, **parallelization doesn't contradict with the work that improves individual code paths. If it's handled correctly, they amplify the final result.**\r\n\r\n> So my suggestion for a roadmap is to work on direct fixes here and in other repositories before RC and then investigate parallelization.\r\n\r\nYeah, I agree to not rush in this PR. As I mentioned in our discussion at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14281#issuecomment-738449342, more work and testing is needed to _\"fine-tune the decisions like how many tasks to use, and what work load shall be done in tasks.\"_ And decisions will change as more perf work on our side and .NET side get in.\r\n\r\nBut I believe we cannot wait till the RC timeframe, as changes in this PR (or similar PRs) need sufficient bake time.",

    "body": "I'm pretty sure ApplicationInsight sends telemetries in an asynchronous way. We are using the default configuraiton with `InMemoryChannel`, whose behavior is (see [\"more telemetry channels\"](https://apmtips.com/posts/2015-09-03-more-telemetry-channels/) for details):\r\n> InMemory channel `Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Channel.InMemoryChannel` is a lightweight loosy telemetry channel that is used by default. It will batch data and initiate sending every `SendingInterval` (default is 30 seconds) or when number of items exceeded `MaxTelemetryBufferCapacity` (default is 500). It also will not retry if it failed to send telemetry.\r\n\r\nWhen using in-memory channel, the `Flush` call is synchronous. It forces data to be sent immediately.\r\n\r\nBut, interestingly, this also indicates that today for the `pwsh -c xxx` scenario, PowerShell never actully send out telemetry packets if the execution takes less than 30 seconds. Need to discuss with @JamesWTruher about whether that's a bug and should be fixed by `.Flush`.",
