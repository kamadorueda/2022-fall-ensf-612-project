    "body": "Sure that's always a concern and something that the pwsh team will have to weigh up when it comes to stuff like this. An ordered dict was used to fix a bug where people wanted the preserved order but unfortunately had a side effect of this. It's up to the Cmdlets Utility Working Group to figure whether this was an acceptible breakage for what it fixed or whether to revert it.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is mostly just a way you can check if it's a dictionary type by using `[System.Collections.IDictionary]` vs `[Hashtable]` or `[OrderedDict]`. This way you can update your scripts to be compatible for both 7.3 and pre 7.3 regardless of whether the change is backed out or kept.",
