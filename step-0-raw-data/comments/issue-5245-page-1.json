    "body": "@nanalakshmanan I believe that Get is the correct verb mapping from AWS describe.  Adding describe to PowerShell just because AWS uses it, isn't the best reason for adding a new approved verb.  It doesn't really define something new that isn't already included in what Get does.  \r\n\r\nI've worked a LOT with AWS and find the mapping works fairly well.  Some of their design choices don't yet match with PowerShell totally, but they have been getting better over the years. In this case, their design decision used *List instead of something else.  Also, some of their commands only have a \"describe-\" options.  For example for \"aws ec2 describe-instances\" doesn't have a \"get-instance\" to go with it, so now you would have a PowerShell Describe-EC2Instance without a Get-EC2Instance.  It would be very confusing.\r\n\r\n@markekraus Your design makes sense.  Maybe AWS will eventually do something similar.\r\n\r\n@nightroman The \"Show\" verb \"Makes a resource visible to the user. This verb is paired with Hide.\" from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714428(v=vs.85).aspx.  This doesn't match with how AWS uses \"describe\". ",
