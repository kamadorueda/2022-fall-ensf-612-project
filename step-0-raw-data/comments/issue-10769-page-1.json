I also don't see the harm in updating the code practices here and there as we make other changes anyway to gradually reduce the instances of the less advisable practice as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, I know @KirkMunro was wanting that change to be in `IsNull` specifically, because that will affect a majority of user-facing PowerShell use cases, as far as I know.

This should be well-documented (youtube is not document) and approved by maintainers. I suggest to open new issue for this.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov: This isn't sporadic. It's about updating a shared piece of code that is used by both the `-is/-isnot` operators and comparison operators in PowerShell, and there are two other open PRs that reference this code. Since multiple PRs are referencing this code that each have ongoing discussions, and since the update is so simple, it made sense to isolate it in its own PR so that it could go in more easily (the irony). It is a focused, and well-founded change about checking if PowerShell objects are null, that should be reviewed and merged.\r\n\r\nDo I think that using `is null` instead of `== null` is a best practice in C# 7 or later?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nDo I think we should use `is null` instead of `== null` in new code that is written in the PowerShell code base?\r\n\r\nYes, because it's a best practice.\r\n\r\nDo I think this is a best practice to follow to the point where we should update our entire code base?\r\n\r\nNo way. We haven't run into a problem with `== null` in our C# code yet that I am aware of, so why take on that effort and slow down everything else unnecessarily?\r\n\r\nAs for how well or not well documented you think that YouTube video is, well, Mads leads the C# design team, and what he said was pretty clear in that video. I can't find it in official docs though, because docs aren't always updated by the people who understand what should be said. The only Microsoft doc I found simply said you could use `is null` to check if something is null, with no mention at all of why they added this. That's not too surprising given that the doc update came from a community PR, and not the C# design team. We'll just have to deal with the imperfect world with open source community contributions and people having too much to do that we live in, I guess.",

If by changing `IsNull` to actually use `is null` we are changing `-eq $null` to actually use `is null` as well, it makes sense to ask if that is what we actually want to do or not. As you point out, we lose the ability to decisively use the a custom equality operator if all equality comparisons to `$null` end up using `is null` internally.\r\n\r\nI'll also point out that I dislike that our `IsNull` public method (that is documented right above it as internal...when did that go public anyway) doesn't really check `is null`, but instead checks `== null`. Otherwise I was thinking it may make sense to have `EqualsNull` as well as `IsNull` if we want the distinction, but existing code is written to use `IsNull` so without wanting to change that, would we have `IsNull` and `ReallyIsNull`? 😝 \r\n\r\nUltimately I just want to get obstacles out of the way of adding `-is $null` and `-isnot $null` support in PR #10704 which adds immediate value, even if all equality comparisons against `$null` use `is null` under the covers, because it makes it possible to check if a property or variable referencing a collection is actually null in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nTo remove the friction that seems to have come up from this, I'm tempted to go back to that PR and not use `IsNullLike`, since it calls `IsNull` which really checks \"equals null or AutomationNull.Value\", and instead just perform the checks myself in a different helper method that actually uses `is null`.",

We could review the classes but it is old classes and I guess they is well-tested.\r\n\r\nThe samples also explicitly show that IL code is the same - no performance benefits.\r\n\r\nThen I found that PowerShell repo contains 5599 of `== null` pattern. And, as @vexx32 mentioned, all is about `object` and standard Core classes. While I do not see where the use of this feature would be _necessary_.\r\n\r\nAll custom classes which could be passed to PowerShell and which have wrong design cannot be fixed in PowerShell engine with the feature. (We can’t even predict that there is a right design for these classes.)\r\n\r\nThen I make quick search in CoreFX. I hoped to find useful examples and was very wonder that I find a few ones although this feature was mentioned two years ago (!). At first look they used it to fix very thin bugs (in unsafe code - that I saw). After that, I'm not surprised that this feature is undocumented.\r\n\r\nSo my current conclusion is that the PR doesn't add any value.\r\n\r\n",
