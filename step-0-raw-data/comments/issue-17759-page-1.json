    "body": "Similar to #17694.\r\n`newManifestInfo` already contains `PrivateData` -> `Tags` when this is executed:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a468fb1f499f5f6f1468571df76b50e85c9f4b39/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/ModuleCmdletBase.cs#L3232-L3236\r\n\r\nObvious solution is to clear `Tags` first with an internal method, but it's a bit brute-force. I'm struggling with getting a hold of this massive function in general. Ex:\r\n1. When will `newManifestInfo.PrivateData` have entries that we won't also find in `manifestInfo.PrivateData`? Code sample?\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a468fb1f499f5f6f1468571df76b50e85c9f4b39/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/ModuleCmdletBase.cs#L3225-L3230\r\n2. Why we're going through the whole `newManifestInfo`-loop at all. Feels like something should've been checked earlier to avoid having to build `PSModuleInfo` twice and merge.",
