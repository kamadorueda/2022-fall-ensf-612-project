    "body": "Aside: Issue labels are assigned based on the issue template; only repository maintainers can edit them.\r\n\r\nProvided programs are made available by adding their home directory to $env:PATH, both Bash and PowerShell should have no issues accessing them just by name, not needing full path. I'm not familiar with Bash to a great extent, but as far as I'm aware, Bash and PowerShell are very similar in this regard.\r\n\r\nPSReadLine has some configurable editing modes that mimic Vim or Emacs more closely, if that's what you're after (though personally I'm not especially fond of them, I guess I'm too accustomed to less arcane methods :wink: ). I believe you can tinker with those using `Set-PSReadLineOption`.\r\n\r\nAs for \"combining\" PowerShell and Bash, this isn't really something you can do without essentially reinventing all of Bash in a whole new language anyway. PowerShell is built on top of several core libraries, most notably .NET Core, and written in C#... whereas Bash is, as far as I know, built directly on the Linux kernel and operates completely in C. Despite the similarity in the _names_ of the languages, that's really effectively where it ends in just about every way imaginable. Invoking raw C code from C# is surprisingly costly in terms of performance.\r\n\r\nWhile Bash is (somewhat) available on Windows, the only real way I'm aware of is under WSL, which would mean restricting any Bash-centric features to that subsystem, whereas the rest of the PowerShell libraries have full access to all of Windows' processes.\r\n\r\nThe long and the short of it is they're fundamentally different tools at their core, and even if they weren't, they operate on fundamentally different designs as well; Bash is purely text-based - everything you can do with it relies on your ability to munge through bits and pieces of text. PowerShell is object-oriented, allowing for much greater flexibility and ease of operation without having to re-parse every piece of output at each step of the process, _and_ can still work quite effectively with manually parsing text should you have the need for it.\r\n\r\nIn my own opinion, Bash has a lot of catching up to do, and there's not really a lot it can add to PowerShell at this point. ðŸ˜‰ \r\n\r\nThere's been talk of an in-terminal text file editor for PS before, but the general consensus thus far seems to be that it's not an especially pressing concern as there are a wide array of vastly more usable tools available on just about every platform PS is available on.",
