I mean change the default behavior to be less error prone and more beginner friendly (in other words Powershell should fall you into [The Pit of Success](https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/) for common scenarios). In the case of `Copy-Item` maybe `-Path` should have `-LiteralPath` behavior and we should add `-WildcardPath` param as other option?\r\n",
