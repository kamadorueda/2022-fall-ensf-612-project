    "body": "In case it helps with prioritization, this showed up as a post-implementation issue for multiple clients at my organization when an internal product upgrade was applied that introduced 'Select -First' in a deploy script.  Wrapper scripts falsely reported the error variable being set as a deploy failure.  I added a workaround that ignores errors with 'HResult = -2146233087' in the most urgent cases, but I know there are some clients who haven't yet encountered this issue and will eventually.  \r\nIt seems safe to assume that no one is _depending_ on the error variable to be set in this scenario. \r\nThanks for whatever attention you can give to the solution.  It may not help my clients who are unlikely to do a major version upgrade in the near future, but it certainly adds to the overall robustness of Powershell. ",
