    "body": "> Could you expand on this a bit? Thanks.\r\n\r\nHi @BrucePay .  I seem to have misinterpreted what I was seeing.  I mistook the misleading contents of `.PositionMessage` as being caused by `Foreach-Object` not passing through error records like `{}.Invoke()`  (#3018).  But this looks more like a manifestation of a [not-so-useful position message noted by @lzybkr](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3647#issuecomment-297208232).  The error record in my OP indeed includes a correct `.ScriptStackTrace` and `.Exception`.  It's just `.InvocationInfo` that has puzzling contents. Whether the contents is puzzling doesn't seem to depend on the use of `Foreach-Object`, though.\r\n\r\nThe less-than-helpful position messages sometimes have a dramatic mismatch between the top of the `.ScriptStackTrace` and the site to which `.InvocationInfo` refers.  The mismatch sometimes results in navigating to an entirely different module which turns out to be unrelated.  That slows troubleshooting.  I guess that's what I was seeing when I wrote \"The consequences of this are broader than might be apparent at first glance.\"  \r\n\r\nHere is a contrived example of such a mismatch:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfunction e {\r\n    param ( [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline)] $x )\r\n    process { f }\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction f { g }\r\n\r\nNew-Module {\r\n    function g { 0-gt 0,0 }\r\n} | Import-Module\r\n\r\ntry\r\n{\r\n    e\r\n}\r\ncatch\r\n{\r\n    $_.ScriptStackTrace\r\n    $_.InvocationInfo.PositionMessage\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe error occured in a module on line 9.  But `.InvocationInfo` doesn't mention anything about that line.  Instead `.InvocationInfo` refers to line 14 which is at the opposite end of the `.ScriptStackTrace` and isn't even in the module where the error originated.",
