(And all the contributors are not happy to receive such requests.)\r\nAny maintainer \"SHOULD make sure contributors are following the contributor guidelines\" - see [Repository Maintainers docs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/docs/maintainers).\r\nAgain - any maintainer SHOULD. It is not personal requests. It is _well-driven dev process_. We do not want to create chaos in our code.\r\n\r\nI absolutely can not accept your \"I'm really getting sick\". You pushed over 1300 line changes and only 30-50 of them are significant. This absolutely contradicts our Coding Guidelines. This forces reviewers to spend a lot of time looking at insignificant changes. It would be nice if you took care not only of your time. As I wrote earlier if you are a very busy person, then you can always ask a help from maintainers and other contributors and say \"I will be busy the whole next month, feel free grab my commits or wait for me to return\". This is more creative than writing \"I'm really getting sick\". \r\n\r\nIn recent months, we have done a great job of correcting style issues in the repo in order to facilitate the work of the contributors. And we continue. We are configuring CodeFactor/StyleCop. We have started to use CodeFormatter (a tooling you ask). We have PR for adding `.editorconfig` for VS. \r\nAll this takes a lot of our time, but as a result, it saves _your_ time.\r\n\r\nI hope for your understanding, patience and help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Quoted from [`Coding Conventions`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/coding-guidelines.md#coding-conventions):\r\n> please avoid reformatting any existing code when submitting a PR as it obscures the functional changes of the PR. A separate PR should be submitted for style-only changes.\r\n\r\nIt's OK to have a small set of style changes along with functional changes in a PR, as long as they are in separate commits. But for a large set of style changes, the _best practice_ is to separate them into another PR.\r\n\r\nWe have this guideline in place actually trying to make the life easier for both the author and reviewer.\r\n- For the reviewer, it's probably harder and cost more time to review such a PR.\r\n- For the author, there are two possibilities when submitting a PR with large set of style changes mixed with functional changes.\r\n   1. No one wants to spend the time going through all the changes, and thus the PR gets left behind with no approval for a long time (I saw this happen before). This will very likely hurt the author's feeling and discourage his/her further contribution.\r\n   1. Since there are large set of style changes, it will be inevitable for reviewers to leave comments about the style changes, which would (1) deviate attention/focus from the more important functional changes; (2) potentially cause dispute because different people may see a style issue differently (you know, it has always been that way when it comes to style and formatting 😄). In the end, this might also discourage the author's further contribution.\r\n\r\nThat is the context why we have this guideline in place. @powercode Hope you can understand, and thanks for your understanding! :)\r\n\r\nHowever, on the other hand, I totally understand that when making changes in unfamiliar code, style changes may have to be made to understand the code before making changes. This often makes the functional changes depend on the style changes that have already been made, and thus makes it hard to separate the style changes to another PR, especially if the author didn't have the `style-only-changes-in-separate-PR` idea in mind at the very beginning.\r\n\r\nIt's a blurry line there, and **I think in such a case, as long as style changes are in separate commits, we can be more accepting of the PR while reminding the author to have the `style-only-changes-in-separate-PR` idea in mind for the future contributions.** As reviewers, [`Reviewable`](https://reviewable.io) could make reviewing easier for such a PR.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov has spent tons of effort cleaning up the code base and unifying the style/formatting to make the code base more readable and maintainable (I really appreciate your work @iSazonov!). But we are not quite there yet, the tools, rules, and guidance are still work-in-progress and we are looking for input. It's an on-going learning experience for all of us maintainers.",

Less work for me!\r\n\r\nI was under the naive impression that the changes was non-controversial, since they were *only formatting* changes, and simplifications that took advantage of more consise ways of expressing the same meaning introduced by newer language versions. \r\n\r\nIn the world I work, a *formatting only* change is mostly ignored, and the focus is on the bits that affect the customers, so I didn't perceive it as something that would generate much more work for you guys.\r\n\r\nI get that the team is more worried about how code style affect readability than I am - so far I have always been able to read the code, even if the style vary widely, and I frankly don't consider it on the top 10 list of things to prioritize on the project.\r\n\r\nWhat I *do* care about is finding the real issues in the code - like the constructor bug I had introduced. \r\n\r\nI do believe it is good, from a workflow perspecive, to start with a refactoring pass when you are about to do a change to some code. By that I mean a pass where no functionality is changed, only formatting and the way things are expressed. It may be introduction of new methods, etc, but functionally the same.\r\n\r\nHaving the requirement that that pass should be in it's own PR seems a bit process-heavy to me, but if that is how you want to roll, I'll adapt.\r\n\r\nJust my €.02.\r\n\r\n",
