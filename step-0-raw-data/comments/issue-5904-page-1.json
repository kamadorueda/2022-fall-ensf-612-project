There are tons of WMI scripts that are still in use even by MS tools, they will fail. Of course they can be rewritten to CIM cmdlets, but it will require some work to do. I don't know much people who use Workflows, but met some customers who really do. So we can not talk about full backward compatibility and that's why I'm asking. \r\nNevertheless, thanks for the answer, I got the message - same extension because almost fully compatible an some breaking changes are not taken into account.\r\n",
