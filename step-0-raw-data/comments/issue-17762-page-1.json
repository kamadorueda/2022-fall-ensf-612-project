I am able to reproduce this, but not when `-OutFile` is used so I'm guessing it's slowing down in the post-processing of the data.\r\n\r\nI am only working with text/html responses, so unfortunately I cannot comment on other filetypes, but I also expected the postprocessing as the culprit so I tried -UseBasicParsing but without success.\r\n\r\nI can confirm that it works very fast with -OutFile also on my side!\r\n\r\nJust a note: The test url is not my server, so it can be that they do something to prevent such requests. However although it works very fast with versions PS5.1 and PS6",
