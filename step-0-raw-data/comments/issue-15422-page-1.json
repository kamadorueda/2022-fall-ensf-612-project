You can check this out by running the following to check the designated editions.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module FailoverClusters -PassThru | Select Name, Version, CompatiblePSEditions\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't say `Core` then you will need to run all your commands in 1 session to ensure the type information isn't lost like so:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$session = New-PSSession -UseWindowsPowerShell\r\n$info = Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { Get-CluserResource -Name 'File Share Witness' | Get-ClusterParameter }\r\n$session | Remove-PSSession\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnything in the `Invoke-Command` ScriptBlock is run in Windows PowerShell as well but instead of each individual command being run the whole pipeline is preserving the type information of the object.",
