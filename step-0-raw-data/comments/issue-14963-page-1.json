    "body": "PowerShell doesn't have a number separator like that. I have previously proposed to add an underscore numeral separator, but it was vetoed during review of the PR a year or two back, I think.\r\n\r\nWhen you do `1.000` PowerShell sees that as a floating point number with the value `1.000`. If you then attempt to use another dot, PowerShell assumes you want to access a property, but `1.000` as a numeric value has no property named `.000` and so it will return $null, and further property access from that point will continue to return $null.\r\n\r\n`1.000.000.000` tells PowerShell:\r\n\r\n1. make a number, `1.000` (floating point, double)\r\n2. access the property of that number called `000` (null)\r\n3. access the property of that value called `000` (null again)",
