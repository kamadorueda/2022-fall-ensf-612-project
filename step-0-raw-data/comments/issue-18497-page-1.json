Why is it useful for \"MyVar\" to go away?\r\n\r\nI read the SO post , which TBH is \"All shells should work in all regards like the shell I know\" and that is just tiresome. \r\n\r\n` $env:MYVAR=\"something\"   ;  someprocess.ps1 `    \r\nWorks. but if `someprocess.ps1` relies on an environment variable it has been written incorrectly, programming 101 is pass your parameters as parameters don't leave them lying about in variables  -  that command should be\r\n` someprocess.ps1 -MYPARAM  \"something\" ` \r\n \r\nWhat about EXEs which use a variable e.g.\r\n```\r\n$env:TF_VAR_Secret = \"DontTell\"   ; terraform  x y z\r\n```\r\nI might accidentally leave the secret in my environment,  but most of the time these variables aren't a problem. \r\nIs putting  `$env:TF_VAR_Secret = $null` for those few occasions a big problem? \r\nUsually if you have a secret it's something you either run it as a script or copy & paste a command line, so there wouldn't me a lot of extra typing. \r\n\r\n",
