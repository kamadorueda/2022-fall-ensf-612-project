Instead it returns the attributes the file had before it was deleted, so there is no real indication that the file was deleted.\r\n\r\nAfter the item is written to the pipeline, when it is displayed, the `Mode` property is null. `Mode` is not one of the regular properties of `FileSystemInfo` and is added after the provider writes the object.\r\n\r\nI think it might be worth keeping the provider code as is (I don't think the `try/catch` is doing us any harm) and change the test so that it ensures that the deleted file is included in the result of `Get-ChildItem`.",
