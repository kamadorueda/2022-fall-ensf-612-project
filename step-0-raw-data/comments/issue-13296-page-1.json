This has a disastrous effect when piped to `SLS` because the content produced depends on the current width.  (example: `HELP HELP | SLS ENTERED`), as well as on the Help system itself, as `HELP ONIDLE` does not include `Register-EngineEvent` when invoked for the 1st time in a session under window width 118.",
