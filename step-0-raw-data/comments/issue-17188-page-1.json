I'm unsure what would cause this, in that case, perhaps a bug in the parameter binder?",

On the second I think the order should go, \r\n\r\n- Get the value from the parameter or the Pipeline\r\n- Then apply any transformation\r\n- Finally apply any validation\r\n\r\nand it probably does already, because anything that means some input _is_ successfully transformed when supplied as a command line argument but _isn't_ when it comes down the pipeline appears perverse, which was I think was the original point :-)  Here we think the point is the transformer is badly written rather than a problem with the order. If the transformer is used in other cmdlets there may be other cases waiting to be discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
