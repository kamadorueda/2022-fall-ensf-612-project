It's not for beauty that bash and other command shells use double or single dashes to indicate parameters. This is a syntax element that allows you to either use the full names of parameters or their abbreviations, which can be grouped into one parameter.\r\n```\r\nls --recursive --size\r\nls -Rs\r\n```\r\nThere is no such possibility in PowerShell, unless you write the binding function yourself, but PowerShell can auto-complete parameters and their values, shorten their spelling until there is a name conflict.
