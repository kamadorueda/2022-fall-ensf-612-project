    "body": "These methods are PSv4+ and it took a while to even get them _documented_ - now they are, as part of [`Get-Help about_Arrays`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_arrays)\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the implicit `.Count` and `.Length` properties are mentioned there.\r\n\r\nWhat these have in common is that they're _part of the plumbing_, if you will: PowerShell makes them available on instances of _any_ type, so as to facilitate unified handling of collections and scalars; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Invoke .ForEach on string *scalar*\r\nPS> 'foo'.ForEach({ \"Hi, $_.\" }\r\nHi, foo.\r\n\r\n# Invoke .Count on an integer *scalar*\r\nPS> (666).Count\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo there is some justification in omitting them from reflecting on a _given type's_ members, given they're not really members of any individual type.\r\n\r\nThat said, perhaps they could be discovered via new `-View` mode, such as `Get-Member -View Universal` - though discovering that view mode may in itself be a challenge.\r\n\r\nI guess showing them by default is an option, but I wonder if that introduces too much noise.",
