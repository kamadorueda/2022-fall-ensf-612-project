    "body": "Can you also publish a package that could act as a \"platform\" dependency, that is, when publishing an app that consumes that package, dotnet cli should not output any dependencies that are already preinstalled by PowerShell (the platform). Essentially a package that defines the PowerShell platform similar to the Microsoft.NETCore.App that defines the .Net Core platform for Console Apps.\n\n**Reasons**: \nIs there a way to build a module with dotnet cli that produce all the required module output? Currently a portable library project does not output any packaged dependencies. What I've done is to use a repurposed console app project because dotnet cli would then collect all the required dependencies on publish. The issue there is that even if I use the platform dependency for the .Net Core it would output the PowerShell reference assemblies (e.g. System.Management.Automation). We've worked around this by manually creating a PowerShell \"platform\" package, but there is the inconvenience of updating this with every release of PowerShell.\n\nIf there is a better approach than to use a platform package, let me know.\n\nHere is a sample fragment from the project.json for the module project.\n\n``` json\n  \"frameworks\": {\n    \"netcoreapp1.0\": {\n      \"dependencies\": {\n        \"PowerShell.Platform\": {\n          \"version\": \"1.0.0-alpha9\",\n          \"type\": \"platform\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n```\n",
