But I suppose that desktop apps got the same problem... we may never find a way to fully delete the whole content of previous versions of a file (without previously encrypting it). And of course there may be VSS copies or backups containing the file as well.\r\nBut I think \"overwriting\" a file should suffice as a feasible way to permanently and \"unrecoverably\" delete files accourding to GDPR requirements.\r\n\r\n\"If\" there is a feasible way, that is to say. \r\n\r\n\r\nA workaround might be: filling ALL empty space with zeroes/random content. But that might confuse the changed block transfer driver for our backup software. May also be very IO-intense, so I'd prefer a \"knive\" solution over the \"sledgehammer\".",
