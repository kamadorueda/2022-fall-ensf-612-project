Before, `Should -Not -Throw`was a negation of `Should -Throw`, which allowed it to catch an exception, and still pass the test. So I corrected the behavior to fail if any exception is thrown. And now I think I should make the assertion fail, if `-Not` and any other filter is used.\r\n\r\nThe change of behavior no longer allows for writing tests that say that \"code should not throw a particular exception, but any other exception is fine\". This is a sacrifice I am willing to make, as this kind of test does not make much sense, and is easy to replicate via `Should -Throw`. \r\n\r\nPersonally I would remove `Should -Not -Throw` from the assertion library completely, if it was easily possible. Because as with any other .NET test framework, any exception thrown within a test fails the test. So `Should -Not -Throw` is implied on every line of code that we write, and there is no need to explicitly call it out. In fact it only help us to write incomplete tests, because it looks like we have an assertion, while we should be testing for a result or an effect instead.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov I am not sure, what you mean by your last remark about `Should` and `Fact`. Should is an assertion, but Fact is an attribute that mark a test in xUnit, did you mean Assert?. Anyways removing Should -Not -Throw, shouldn't be a problem. \r\n",

A test is supposed to validate that something useful happened. A function can be useful by either returning the correct result, or producing the correct side effect. (eg. adding 1+1 and making sure you got 2, or deleting a file and making sure it's deleted).  \r\n\r\nA function that does not return any value, and does not have any side effects is not useful. (but feel free to prove me wrong :) )\r\n\r\nComing back to our useful functions we can see that pre-requisites for successfully returning the correct value, or producing the correct side-effect is that the code does not throw. So a test that only validates that you did not throw, is just a subset of a more useful test that would test the resulting value, or the resulting side-effect.\r\n\r\n( If this does not make a sense, you can view it from TDD point of view. A test is a mean that allows you to force your code to have the desired behavior. By writing a test that validates that your function returns 2 for input 1 and 1 you are forcing the function to implement some behavior, because by default it does not return anything. BUT by expecting the code to not throw, you are not forcing anything new, because empty functions do not throw by default. )\r\n",

    "body": "This logic is perfectly correct in the general case. We would have to do all our tests that way. But we have _edge_ cases where we are forced to use this \"Should -Not -Throw\". For example, in this PR we say that modified psversiontable can be formatted, but we do not check the exact result - such a test would be unduly complicated, so we just check that there is no exception - then we _trust_ formatting system tests that exist separately. There are other examples when there is output to the console, user interaction, changing system settings (Set-Date). So \"Should -Not -Throw\" helps us to simplify tests if it is justified or impossible otherwise.",
