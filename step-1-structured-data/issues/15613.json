Which makes sense IMHO because foo is a closer match to \"foo.bat\" than to \"foo_bar_foo.bat\". However, suddenly it started iterating backwards for me and I assume it has something to to with .NET framework as I wrote initially.  Can you still, please check if this behavior is possible to fix within Powershell Core? I would be very thankful since it makes my life easier.</div>",
