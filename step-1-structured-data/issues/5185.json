      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm happy to have a look at this issue if no-one else has been assigned to it, and it is something that is wanted.\r\n\r\nIf so, I have a few questions:\r\n- Having a look through the codebase, I believe the file [`Process.cs`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/Process.cs#L2016) is where this should be implemented\r\n- [`Process.WaitForExit`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ty0d8k56(v=vs.110).aspx) uses milliseconds for the timeout value. Should the `Start-Process` parameter also expect milliseconds?\r\n- What should the `Start-Process` parameter be called? I am going to assume `-Timeout`, although `-WaitTimeout` or `-ProcessTimeout` could also be suitable\r\n\r\n--- Edit ---\r\nIn response to the last two questions, I have now found the [`Wait-Process`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/wait-process?view=powershell-5.1) cmdlet which uses a `-Timeout` parameter with seconds ([Microsoft Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/wait-process?view=powershell-5.1#optional-parameters), [PowerShell Code](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/Process.cs#L882)). I shall use those settings for consistency.",
