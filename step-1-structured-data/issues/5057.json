  "body": "If a path specified by `-LiteralPath` does not exist (or is not valid, i.e.\r\ncontains forbidden characters) then `Get-Item` should emit an error.\r\nCurrently this does not happen if a path is defined as a wildcard.\r\n\r\nThe change #4866 fixed this issue for `Remove-Item`.\r\nThe same or similar should be done for `Get-Item`.\r\n\r\n**Example:**\r\n\r\n<strike>Given items `z.*` and `[z]` do not exist</strike>\r\nEDIT: Given item `[z]` does not exist. As for `z.*`, it is always \"invalid\" for `LiteralPath`.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Item -LiteralPath z.*\r\nGet-Item -LiteralPath [z]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Expected result:**\r\n\r\n`Get-Item` emit errors about not found items.\r\n\r\nIn fact, an error for `z.*` may even be different, namely \"Illegal characters\r\nin the path\" because `*` or `?` are illegal for `-LiteralPath` and FileSystem.\r\n\r\n**Actual result:**\r\n\r\nThe above commands silently return nothing.\r\n",
