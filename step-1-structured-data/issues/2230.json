  "body": "As a heads-up, the expression interpreter under `src\\System.Management.Automation\\engine\\interpreter` seems to be a clone from the original code in the DLR. Many improvements to it were made in the CoreFx repo at http://github.com/dotnet/corefx. It'd be good to consider either porting these changes or eliminating the copy altogether once the `Compile(bool preferInterpretation)` overload is available on all platforms by PowerShell. Note that the regular `Compile()` overload will be available on all platforms that support `System.Linq.Expressions` and will use the interpreter in case the compiler is not available.\n",
