Start the new Powershell core in a embeded Powershell console instead of the cmd window.\r\n\r\n2. In the \"Language for non-Unicode programs\" selection, select the language for non-Unicode programs as English. Then the cmd also works. (as attached screen shot)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16246343/26875057-040a24be-4b35-11e7-8aaa-3d9b1b418591.png)\r\n\r\n3. Use get-help instead of help to skip the \"pipe into more\".\r\n\r\nI would suggest set the resolution as external for this issue as it is not powershell specific.",
