  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nThe execution of the `Invoke-WebRequest` call is unexpectedly slow.\r\n\r\nFor example, when downloading a GitHub Actions Runner project, the use of `Invoke-WebRequest` is very slow.\r\nThis call:\r\n\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.285.1/actions-runner-win-x64-2.285.1.zip -OutFile actions-runner-win-x64-2.285.1.zip`\r\n\r\nis significantly slower than this\r\n\r\n`(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile(\"https://github.com/actions/runner/releases/download/v2.285.1/actions-runner-win-x64-2.285.1.zip\", \"$PWD\\actions-runner-win-x64-2.285.1.zip\")`\r\n\r\nThe performance difference with this ~70mb file (on my machine)?\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest`: 154.4 seconds\u2028\r\n`Net.WebClient`: 3.41 seconds\u2028\u2028\r\n\r\nCan you investigate this problem and possibly fix the underlying commands so that the `Invoke-WebRequest` is faster?\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
