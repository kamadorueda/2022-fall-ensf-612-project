Scripts are added with `ps.Commands.AddScript(script)` the same way you can use `ps.AddScript(script)` and the entry is removed in both cases from `ps.Commands` when you call `ps.Commands.Clear()`",

The relationship between ps.Commands content and ps content was the point of confusion for me - I'd assumed the commands are for commands only and didn't look for scripts in there. @jborean93 comment clears it up, thanks.",
