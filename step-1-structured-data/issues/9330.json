      "body": "I wouldn't classify it as a quirk, its actually intentional, and comes from the DOS days when all _files_ had an inherent period at the end of their names.   At that time, the period was a field separator, separating the name from the extension (and the period was not stored on disk), and of course only one period was allowed, the separator.   Today in Windows, the last period in any pattern is considered to be that same separator between name and extension, and so receives special treatment, but yet does not stop it from matching other patterns that might also include a `.` before the actual extension, because in some ways you might consider the extension of a file to have multiple periods.\r\n\r\nNote that `DIR *.` in CMD will match any file or directory either doesn't have a '.' or that the only '.' is at the beginning of the file name, as a period at the beginning of a file name is not considered to be defining an extension, since the name field would be empty, and that is not allowed.\r\n",

      "body": "Good to know, @msftrncs. Undoubtedly, `*.` serves a useful purpose and is a handy way to find extension-less files (and directories).\r\n\r\nAs you state, the `.` isn't actually part of the filename, and by default you can't even create a file whose actual name ends in `.`; e.g., `ab.`; if you use the `\\\\?\\` prefix (invariably with an _absolute_ path), however, you can (`New-Item ('\\\\?\\' + $pwd.ProviderPath + '\\ab.')`), and `cmd /c dir *.` matches that too.\r\n\r\nOn a related note, if you don't use the `\\\\?\\` prefix, any _trailing spaces or periods_ your specify as part of a path are quietly ignored (`Get-Item -Path ab.....` will find file `ab`, for instance, with both `-Path` and `-LiteralPath`).\r\n\r\n",

You won't be able to open or interact with the file at all without using a `\\\\?\\` prefix. \r\n\r\nEasy ways to create such a file:\r\n  - Create a Scheduled Task in Task Scheduler with a naming ending in a period\r\n  - Linux subsystem for Windows (eg, `touch a.file.`)\r\n\r\nNote that powershell Core for linux running on WSL doesn't have the same restriction, so we can't really blame powershell.  Also, [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/FileIO/naming-a-file) recommend against creating such a file.\r\n\r\n> Do not end a file or directory name with a space or a period. Although the underlying file system may support such names, the Windows shell and user interface does not. ",
