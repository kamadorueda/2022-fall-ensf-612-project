  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user,\r\nI want to be able to easily use `Select-String` to find string data in formatted output,\r\nso that I can find and process data in PowerShell more quickly.\r\n\r\nBy default, when you pass non-string data into the `Select-String` cmdlet, it will find matches based on the object's `ToString()` method results. This is great when the `ToString` output actually represents the data you want to match, but very often `ToString` results do not represent the data that you see in PowerShell, and this can result in incorrect or failed matches.\r\n\r\nFor example, consider this script:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# First, capture the date:\r\n$date = Get-Date\r\n\r\n# Now, get the current month in string format:\r\n$month = $date.ToString(\"MMMM\")\r\n\r\n# Now, look at how the date renders in PowerShell, showing the month as a string\r\n$date\r\n\r\n# Now, try to match the month using Select-String. This returns nothing.\r\nGet-Date | Select-String -Pattern $month\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat script shows the current date, including the month in string format, but if you try to select that string based on the actual string month, there are no matches. Why does this happen? Because `ToString()` on `DateTime` objects returns the date time with a numeric month, not the string month.\r\n\r\nNow let's look at a more realistic example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Get some services, including the Windows Update service, and filter output on the\r\n# string \"Update\"\r\nGet-Service wuauserv,bits | Select-String Update\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat returns nothing. Why? Because the `ToString` method on service objects returns the name of service, so you can't filter output based on a partial match of a display name string this way.\r\n\r\nHere is one more example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Process -Id $PID | Format-List * | Select-String Memory\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis also returns nothing, because of the `ToString` method on `Format` cmdlet output objects returns their type name, none of which match `Memory`.\r\n\r\n_It is reasonable for a user to expect to be able to easily and consistently parse/filter output that is rendered in the PowerShell console, but this is not possible unless they pipe to `Out-String -Stream` before they then pipe that streamed result to `Select-String`._\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n[EDIT]: Updated to reflect the parameter name we decided to move forward in the discussion below.\r\n\r\nI want to make `Select-String` better by adding a new ~~`-ConsoleOutput` switch parameter (or some better parameter name: suggestions welcome)~~ `-FromFormattedOutput` switch parameter that indicates that you want to select a string based on the console output of the data that is piped into `Select-String`, which would automatically take care of the formatting and output of non-value and non-string types (and non-MatchInfo, but that's a special case internally for `Select-String`), and select string matches based on that output rather than based on the `ToString` method output of individual objects.\r\n\r\n# Additional details\r\n\r\nPersonally I would prefer if Select-String worked this way by default for non-value and non-string types, but that would be a breaking change at this point, so that's not an option; however, users who want it to work this way by default can use `$PSDefaultParameterValues['Select-String:FromFormattedOutput'] = $true`, and that will have the same result.\r\n",

I like those better than `-FromDisplay`, because this is more about streaming object input into the command.

So that would hit the test correctly -- Select-String would grab the value, see it's the same as the object's type name, and then pass the PSObject through Out-String before attempting to process the value.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Oh, I see what you mean, there's an extra piece attached to that ToString() huh... hmm. maybe if the conversion to string `.StartsWith()` the type name?",

I use `findstr` and `grep` all the time (and if I ever get around to setting up [this](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/integrate-linux-commands-into-windows-with-powershell-and-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux/), I'll just use `grep` everywhere).\r\n* My inclination in reading through the thread is actually to lean towards an entirely new cmdlet with the reasoning that it sounds like there's multiple behaviors one might want, and an expanding matrix of parameters on `Select-String` doesn't sound awesome. Don't get hung up on the name, but I think something like a `Select-FormattedOutput`, `Select-FormattedString`, `Select-Output`, `Select-HostOutput`, `Select-HostText`, `Select-Text` etc. would be helpful.\r\n* I'm very worried about breaking changes to `Select-String`. Not picking on you at all, @mklement0 (I saw this sentiment throughout the thread), but with regards to this statement:\r\n  > On the input side, there are probably not too many people who rely on the current behavior, **as it is either near-useless or hard to predict**\r\n\r\n  The issue with breaking changes is that often folks have hardcoded themselves to work around \"hard to predict\" behaviors. Take @KirkMunro's `Get-Date` example: the default `ToString()` doesn't return what's output by the default formatter. Maybe I did it once, realized that the string name of the month wasn't in the part parsed by `Select-String`, and now I'm actually trying to parse \"12/18/2019 2:52:23 PM\" as a mm/dd/yyyy string and hand it to some native utility. This breaks me catastrophically. \r\n\r\nTo that end, I propose that one or two people actually build this, throw it up on the Gallery, and then we can actually play with an implementation and decide what fits right across multiple platforms (I have a strong feeling we won't get it right on the first try). \r\n\r\nMight it actually just be a wrapper on findstr and grep depending on platform? Or is there a reason we would want this to be fully implemented in PowerShell land?",

If there's an elegant design that proves to be popular, we can consider including it in the future. \r\n\r\nWe do agree that we should stop telling new users that `Select-String`/`sls` is our `grep` equivalent and document the existing utilities and `foo | Out-String | Select-String 'bar'` workaround better.\r\n\r\nOh, and we bikeshedded on the name of the cmdlet for a while.

      "body": "@joeyaiello What is the perceived value in adding another cmdlet to do essentially the same job? :confused:\r\n\r\nThe way I see it at the moment is:\r\n\r\n1. We _have_ a `Select-String` cmdlet,\r\n2. for which a lot of potential piped input is effectively useless, because\r\n3. most objects' `ToString()` values are significantly less useful than their `Out-String` values.\r\n\r\nAdding another cmdlet effectively only duplicates `Select-String` (and likely quite a lot of code if we're not very careful and do a lot of refactoring of the original cmdlet _as well_), and would effectively make `Select-String` a second-class citizen -- we introduce a new cmdlet that does everything `Select-String` does, _and more_, and then Select-String becomes effectively useless, since the new cmdlet would already do what Select-String does.\r\n\r\nI don't see a particular need for this to _be_ a whole extra cmdlet, and nor do I think adding one additional parameter would be a huge change for this cmdlet. If we're talking adding parameters to `Invoke-WebRequest`, sure, cause for caution. Here? Not so much, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nThat said, looking at the current syntax diagram for `Select-String`, we clearly need to do something about excessive listing of possible values for `-Culture`, but on the whole it doesn't have that many parameters, and that issue is something we need to fix in the help system, not the cmdlet itself.",

      "body": "@bpayette There's scripting in scripts, where you want performance and you want to use .NET objects, and there's ad-hoc use where you are pulling data and you want to get chunks of it quickly and easily. That's why `grep` or `findstr` are used even by folks on the PS Team or PMs not on the PS team in place of `Select-String`, and in place of using `Out-String -Stream`, `Where-Object`, etc. Being able to get information quickly and easily is highly useful, which is the motivation here. The motivation here, at list for me, isn't to use `Select-String` to filter output in scripts.\r\n\r\nMy only argument for updating `Select-String` vs a new command is to have a single command to do easy filtering with highlighting of what it found in-box so that I don't have to worry about what system I'm on when I use it. Given PowerShell is a shell, this seems like solid value to offer across the board. I can use `grep` or `findstr`, but I tend to stick to native, in-box PS that just works everywhere. That's where I think augmenting `Select-String` vs using @SteveL-MSFT's `Select-Text` in his upcoming module adds value.\r\n\r\nGiven the pushback on augmentation of `Select-String` and the concern around breaking changes, I'll just hope that a successor gets enough traction to replace `Select-String` with a suitably short alias in-box, and then just switch to that.",
