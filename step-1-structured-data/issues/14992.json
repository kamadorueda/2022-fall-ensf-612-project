I need such a \u3010parameter-alias local plan\u3011,or another better plan.\r\nSince the release of powershell v7 2020-03, I have used psv7 to make the two largest projects in the world. Although in these two projects, there is still a lot of shit mountain code.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 kasini3000. https://gitee.com/chuanjiao10/kasini3000\r\nIt is mature and claims to be able to replace \u3010ansible's\u3011 powershell automatic operation and maintenance tool project.\r\n\r\n2 k4t. https://gitee.com/chuanjiao10/k4t\r\nNot open source for the time being. Claimed to be a better container automatic operation and maintenance platform than \u3010kubernetes\u3011. Known as the atomic bomb project in the container world.\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"no_portrait.png#chuanjiao10-chuanjiao10\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>Gitee</div><div><strong><a href=\"http://gitee.com/chuanjiao10/kasini3000\">chuanjiao10/kasini3000</a></strong></div><div>\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8ePuppet\uff0cAnsible\uff0cpipeline\u3002\u53f7\u79f0\u6bd4ansible\u597d10\u500d\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6279\u91cf\u8fdc\u7a0b\u6267\u884c\u811a\u672c\uff0c\u5b9a\u65f6\u811a\u672c\u7684\uff0cdevops\u8fd0\u7ef4\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u8fd0\u7ef4\u624b\u4e2d\u7684\u745e\u58eb\u519b\u5200\uff01</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote><img src=\"no_portrait.png#chuanjiao10-chuanjiao10\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>Gitee</div><div><strong><a href=\"http://gitee.com/chuanjiao10/k4t\">chuanjiao10/k4t</a></strong></div><div>\u6211\u7528powershell\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\uff0c\u53f7\u79f0\u6bd4k8s\u7b80\u535510\u500d\uff0c\u529f\u80fd\u5f3a1\u500d\u7684\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f3a1\u500d\u7684\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u5bb9\u5668\u7f16\u6392\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5168\u529f\u80fd\u56fd\u4ea7k8s</div></blockquote>",
