  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nWe caught an amazing problem in #14513 - a test failed because of a difference in string sorting on different platforms.\r\n\r\nI tested on different Windows systems and was very amazed to see different behavior on _different Windows_ versions too.\r\n\r\nAfter consulting with .Net team it turned out that although the latest versions of .Net work with ICU but _Windows 10 older versions do not support ICU completely_. This is the version used in PowerShell CI Windows. \r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54472#issuecomment-867108314 and follow comments.\r\n\r\nIf we want to have full consistency across all platforms and versions we should include System.Globalization.AppLocalIcu package in our Windows distribution.\r\n\r\nThis probably makes sense since users may also encounter unpredictable string handling and sorting is just one of those scenarios.\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/54472#issuecomment-867108314\r\n\r\n```\r\n<ItemGroup\">\r\n  <PackageReference Include=\"Microsoft.ICU.ICU4C.Runtime\" Version=\"68.2.0.6\" />\r\n  <RuntimeHostConfigurationOption Include=\"System.Globalization.AppLocalIcu\" Value=\"68.2\" />\r\n</ItemGroup>\r\n```",
