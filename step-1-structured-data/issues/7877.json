  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\n1. Add new Offset and Count parameters. Resolve #3383.\r\n2. Modify ByteCollection class to support offsets up to UInt64.MaxValue size.\r\n3. Hide/obsolete Raw parameter because the behavior is by default. Related #7868.\r\n4. Optimize conversion to bytes to reduce allocations for large input data.\r\n\r\n### Additional comments\r\n\r\n1. For review: Now Offset parameter does a shift in output byte stream. Since we accept objects as input we could consider Offset as \"skip the Offset-count objects from input (array/pipeline)\" although Skip parameter is more suitable for this (or  Select-Object -Skip) and this is contrary to the behavior for input streams (Path parameter or FileInfo input object).\r\n\r\n2. I don't consider a scenario \"get last count bytes\". As a minimum, the PR should not block this enhancement.\r\n\r\n3. New ReFS file system support files up to UInt64.MaxValue. So ByteCollection is modified to support UInt64.MaxValue too. \r\nOn the other hand current .Net Core limitation is Int64.MaxValue for file size/offset. In result we have to use Int64 type for Offset and Count parameters.\r\n\r\n/cc @rkeithhill @mklement0 @adamdriscoll \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] Issue filed - Issue link: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2986\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
