It will break access to systems in the current PowerShell session.\r\n\r\nAt the very least this should have been done instead:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat way access to older systems in the same session wont mysterious;y break.\r\n\r\n/cc @SteveL-MSFT @TravisEz13 @iSazonov @daxian-dbw ",
