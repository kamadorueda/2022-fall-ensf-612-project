  "body": "In the documentation for Powershell commands, can it be listed which versions of powershell the command works with? EX. get-localgroupmember command only works in Powershell 5.1 and up. But you have to check on the left hand side where it says Powershell version to see if the command is compatible with a certain version. This could just be listed at the top of the documentation of each command.",
