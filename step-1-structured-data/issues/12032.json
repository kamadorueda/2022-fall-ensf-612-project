  "body": "If you're trying to set a _persistent_ execution policy (`-Scope LocalMachine` or `-Scope CurrentUser`)  while a _process-level_ policy happens to be in effect (`-Scope Process` or, more likely, `-ExecutionPolicy` via the CLI), updating the persistent policy succeeds, but for the current process the previous process-level policy remains in effect.\r\n\r\n`Set-ExecutionPolicy` commendably tries to alert the user to that fact, but instead of issuing  a _warning_, it emits a _statement-terminating error_.\r\n\r\nYou can tell from the wording of the message alone that this shouldn't be an _error_ (emphasis added):\r\n\r\n> Set-ExecutionPolicy: **PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully**, but the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope.  Due to the override, your shell will retain its current effective execution policy of Restricted. Type \"Get-ExecutionPolicy -List\" to view your execution policy settings.

      "body": "Well, it is pretty clear from the code that whoever implemented this felt this should be a terminating error.  My guess is that this was done to support scripts where changing the execution policy setting is critical for the script to succeed.  So even if the 'policy' is successfully changed at a specific scope, but the actual state doesn't change because some other scope overrides it, then it is an error.  \r\n\r\nIt seems like it would have been better to have separate cmdlets that had clear responsibility for affecting policy and for affecting current state.  But changing this now would be a breaking change (unless we propose new cmdlets and deprecate the old).  \r\n\r\nFeel free to add the 'Review-Committee' tag if you feel this should be considered.",

      "body": "Well put, @vexx32.\r\n\r\nI think that without backward-compatibility considerations, that is the way to go.\r\nTo _also, implicitly_ update the `Process` scope  is definitely not the _primary_ purpose when you target `-Scope CurrentUser` or `-Scope LocalMachine`.\r\n(This secondary action generally makes sense, but isn't even documented as such.)\r\n\r\nAs for it being a breaking change:\r\n\r\nHypothetically, someone who relied on a `try` / `catch` _with a `throw` in the `catch` block_ would be affected, as that is the only way to _abort_ the script - given that _statement_-terminating errors do not abort the script _as a whole_.\r\n\r\nMuch more likely, `try` / `catch` has been used _without_ `throw`, simply to silence the unexpected error, because the typical use case I've seen is the following:\r\n\r\n ```powershell\r\npwsh -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -c 'Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned -Force; ...'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is a perfectly reasonable command, yet it triggers the statement-terminating error and requires a `try` / `catch` simply to silence it.\r\n(Note that, unlike what I've originally said in the OP (since fixed), the error occurs irrespective of whether the persistent policy being set is more or less restrictive than the effective process-level one.)\r\n\r\nIn short: I would consider this a [Bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area) change.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Most tools that are running powershell use the `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` mode on the executable itself.\r\n\r\nEven if we assume that a decent portion of folks are running the cmdlet itself where the issue occurs, for the proposed change to break something, the _environment_ itself would have to change. (Unless something is relying on _not_ being able to change the execution policy, which... seems like a contrived scenario even at the most optimistic assessment I can muster.) That being the case would be a problem regardless of whether or not this change is taken, so the only time this impacts an automation scenario is it starting to fail... which _would happen anyway_, only more severely and slightly more obviously without the proposed change.\r\n\r\nAnd that, inherently, means the code _is_ being maintained, or at least the server / other system it's on is being updated, and something is bound to break or require a bit of fixing from time to time regardless.\r\n\r\nI'm really not seeing any particular value in leaving things the way they are here, and nor do I see a lot of potential value in further complicating the executionpolicy settings. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642 ",
