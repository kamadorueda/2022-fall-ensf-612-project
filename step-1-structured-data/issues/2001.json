  "body": "The Dockerfile in the repo doesn't actually build from source.\n\nThe Dockerfile in a repo should be able to build the repo from it's current state. As of right now, I can't `git checkout` an old revision and then do a `docker build` to get a container containing the state of the container.\n\nI filed a similar issue in [the new azure-cli](https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/168) repository and they moved to a Dockerfile that builds from the real state of the repo.\n\nAs-is, this project is missing out on the benefits of Docker. I want to be able to clone this repo and type `docker build -it ps .` and get a build of `master` inside a Docker container. This makes it easier for others to contribute.\n\n(It also directly lends itself to making #2002 easier).\n",

I changed the name of the download.sh file since I wasn't sure at that time if changes for docker would impact that file significantly. \n\nI 100% agree that the download,sh script should be used as long as we remove sudo and add in removal of the downloaded package.\n\nWe are talking about this on #1992 \n",
