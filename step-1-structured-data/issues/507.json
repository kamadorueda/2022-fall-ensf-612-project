The real one on Windows, and @zach-folwick's replacement for it on Linux.\n\nWe will need to take a runtime specific dependency on two different projects (blocked by NuGet/Home#1660). It would turn into a three packages, the MMIN API referenced by the rest of the project, and it would reference the Linux and Windows versions, much the same way that .NET Core builds platform specific packages.\n",
