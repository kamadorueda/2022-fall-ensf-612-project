  "body": "Previously, -literalpath given a wildcard will treat it the same as -path and if the wildcard found no files, it would silently exit.  Correct behavior should be that -literalpath is literal so if the file doesn't exist, it should error.  Fix is to also see if wildcard is being suppressed.\r\n\r\nAlso re-enabled and fixed some tests that were skipped incorrectly (should have been pending) since the issue was addressed.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5057\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
