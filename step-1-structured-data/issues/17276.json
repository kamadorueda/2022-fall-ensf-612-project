  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\n### Problem\r\nIn the case I have multiple servers where I want to run a scriptblock, including the server I am connected on, I am forced to write this over explicit code :\r\nNote : the powershell session is running on ServerB\r\n```\r\nfor ($computer in \"ServerA\", \"ServerB\", \"ServerC\") {\r\n    if ($computer -like $env:computername ) {\r\n        # Computer = ServerB\r\n        $Jobs += start-job -ScriptBlock $ScripBlock\r\n    } else {\r\n        # Computer = ServerA or ServerC\r\n        $Jobs += Invoke-Command -ComputerName $computer -AsJob -ScriptBlock $ScripBlock\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Reason \r\n- Start-job does not allow to run jobs on remote host\r\n- Invoke-Command -ComputerName $env:computername -asjob -ScriptBlock $ScripBlock\r\n  - Requires to be \"ran as administrator\" to function \r\n    - OR\r\n  - throws an error  `OpenError: [Hostname] Connecting to remote server Hostname failed with the following error message : Access is denied. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.`\r\n- `Invoke-Command -AsJob -ScriptBlock { dir }` does not match required parameter set\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\nThis is not new to powershell and I have always found complexity into writing scriptblocks that could run on multiple servers, including the local server I am connected on\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nAs `start-job` does not require to \"run as administrator\" I feel like there shouldn't be any restrictions into being able to run\r\n- `Invoke-Command -AsJob -ScriptBlock { dir }` which could be, somehow, an alias of `start-job`\r\n- `Invoke-Command -AsJob -ScriptBlock { dir } -computername $env:computername`\r\nwithout having to use the 'log on as adaministrator' switch",

      "body": "The administrator restriction is on the remoting (WinRM) endpoint for security and is set by default.  It is possible to remove the admin constraint from the endpoint but not advisable.  It is interesting that the credentials used to log onto the remote machines work, but fail for the local machine case.  `Start-Job` does not connect to a WinRM endpoint like `Invoke-Command`, and instead connects to a local child process with the same user account as the parent process, so there are no security concerns as with WinRM endpoints which can accept off-box connections.\r\n\r\nI am not sure it is worth adding the ability to create a local job to `Invoke-Command -AsJob`.  It seems better to create a helper function that makes the decision to start an off-box WinRM job connection or a local job connection.",
