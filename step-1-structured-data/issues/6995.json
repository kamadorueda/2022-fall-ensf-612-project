  "body": "`Get-Date` already supports _output_ date formatting via `-Format`, but it would also be handy to allow passing date/time _strings_ along with an _input_ format string so as to allow from-string conversion, say via:\r\n\r\n* adding an `-InputFormat` parameter\r\n* adding a `-Culture` parameter (which could be used in insolation or combined with `-InputFormat`)\r\n* changing the `-Date` parameter type to `[object]` so that users can pass strings as well.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# The following would be the equivalent of:\r\n#   [datetime]::ParseExact('19-06-2018', 'dd-MM-yyyy', $null)\r\nPS> Get-Date -Date '19-06-2018' -InputFormat 'dd-MM-yyyy' # wishful thinking\r\n\r\nTuesday, June 19, 2018 12:00:00 AM\r\n\r\n# The following would be the equivalent of:\r\n#     [datetime]::Parse('19-06-2018', [cultureinfo] 'de-DE')\r\nPS> Get-Date -Date '19-06-2018' -Culture de-DE # wishful thinking \r\n\r\nTuesday, June 19, 2018 12:00:00 AM\r\n```\r\n\r\nA note re culture-sensitive behavior:\r\n\r\nDue to an inconsistency, when `Get-Date -Date` is currently passed a _string_, that string is (implicitly) converted to a `[datetime]` instance in a culture-_sensitive_ fashion - whereas in most other to-and-from string conversions PowerShell by design applies the _invariant_ culture - see #6989.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the following actually currently works while culture `de-DE` is in effect, even though it arguably _shouldn't_:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# !! Works with [cultureinfo]::currentculture = 'de-DE', for instance.\r\nGet-Date -Date '19-06-2018'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWritten as of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.1.0-preview.2\r\n```\r\n",
