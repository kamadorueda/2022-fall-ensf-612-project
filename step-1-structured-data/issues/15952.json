  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nWe are working on a script that installs the Ubuntu distro for WSL. While the appx is downloading, another intune process is restarting the computer, therefore interrupting the download and the install doesn't happen. What we'd like to do is to be able to tell windows \"I need you to not reboot while I'm running. Wait until I'm done.\"\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nI don't know the windows internals, but calling it with a command like 'Postpone-Restart' would be sufficent.",

You can abort a shutdown request that is in place with `shutdown.exe /a`. So theorectically you could have a loop that continues to run that (or at least the Win32 API equivalent) but this won't catch things that are shutting the host down immediately with no time to wait.",
