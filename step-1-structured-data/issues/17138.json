  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSCCM cmdlets honour the $VerbosePreference value of the calling scope.\r\nIf $VerbosePreference is set to \"Continue\", passing -Verbose:$false does not disable verbose output.\r\n\r\nWorkarounds are to put all SCCM cmdlets in their own script blocks, and override $VerbosePreference in each script block.\r\nThis introduces its own issues with variable scope.\r\nAn alternative is to save and restore the $VerbosePreference, before and after calling each cmdlet,\r\nbut this adds extra lines of unwanted code.\r\n\r\nThe docs for PS indicates that passing -Verbose:$false should disable verbose output, but clearly the SCCM cmdlets are not working in this way. As SCCM is another MS product I figured you wouldn't mind me opening a bug for this here ;)\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\n$VerbosePreference = \"Continue\" # module or script scope\r\n$someCmApp | Move-CMObject -FolderPath \\blah\\de\\blah -Verbose:$false\r\n# no verbose output desired from SCCM cmdlet\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n# pages of verbose output\r\n# however...\r\n\r\n$VerbosePreference = \"Continue\" # module or script scope\r\n...\r\n# other work where verbose output is desired\r\n...\r\n& {\r\n  $VerbosePreference = \"SilentlyContinue\"\r\n  Move-CMObject ...\r\n  # no Verbose output with the nested script block\r\n}\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
