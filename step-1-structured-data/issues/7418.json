  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nTryConvertTo is implemented in terms of Convert, but with wrapping exception handling. \r\nThis is costly performance wise, so by inlining the implementation of ConvertTo, and getting access to the FigureConversion output. Using that we can determine upfront on at least some occations that a conversion is not available.\r\n\r\nFixes #7420 \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

They are as follows:\r\n- Address @iSazonov's comment about the rename `variable` to `value` to be consistent with other instances.\r\n- Change `out var` to `out object` and `out bool` to make the type of the out parameter a little more explicit.\r\n- Change the indentation of the parameters for the call to `conversion.Invoke`.\r\n\r\nThank you again for the great contribution!",
