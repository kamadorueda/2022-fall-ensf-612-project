      "body": "Oh, PowerShell sometime re-evaluates things ... This is not always a problem. This is not a problem in this example (until dynamic parameter requests expensive resource). If this was during the work of the pipeline (on hot path), then this would be a problem - have you an example with hot path?\r\n",

I've seen this where a module has hundreds of dynamic params  each making multiple calls to a server. Tab got really slow.  It's one more reason to avoid them \r\n",
