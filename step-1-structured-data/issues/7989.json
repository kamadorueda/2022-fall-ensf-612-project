  "body": "Summary\r\n------------------\r\nI need a way to specify (using command line arguments to `pwsh`) a mapping between Powershell streams and process file descriptors . Right now I can't see a way to prevent warnings, progress information, and debug messages from being munged together on stdout alongside data that needs to be in a particular format (e.g. JSON).\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nPut the following code into a file `test`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n#!/usr/bin/env pwsh\r\nWrite-Warning \"test\"\r\nWrite-Output \"[{ foo: 1 }]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn some shell of your choosing, run the equivalent of:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nchmod +x ./test\r\n./test 1>output 2>error\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nThe file `output` should contain:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n[{ foo: 1 }]\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nThe file `output` contains:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nWARNING: test\r\n[{ foo: 1 }]\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0\r\nOS                             Linux 4.18.9-arch1-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Sep 19 21:19:17 UTC 2018\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",

By default, I believe it is expected for the extended streams to be sent to STDOUT from pwsh.exe as it can't send it anywhere else.  Trying to understand the use case here.  If you don't want the Warning stream, you could just add `$WarningPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\"` into the script.  If you want to redirect those streams to something else, you can do it within the script as well.\r\n\r\nAre you asking for something like:\r\n\r\n```none\r\npwsh -warning warning.txt\r\n```\r\n",

It's going to live alongside a variety of other scripts (most of which are not implemented in Powershell) that emit an identical format.\r\n\r\nRight now the script pollutes stdout with warning/progress/debug information emitted by the various modules it uses. If this was instead a bash script, stuff that is emitted on fd 3 by a sourced third party script or exe would not contaminate the output of fd 1 (i.e. stdout).\r\n\r\nI can certainly try and suppress everything besides the Powershell output stream at a global level, but I'd prefer to still have this information available if needed. More importantly, I'd like to avoid having to modify the script at all.",
