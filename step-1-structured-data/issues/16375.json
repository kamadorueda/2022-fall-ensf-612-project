I'll take to cmdlet working group, because I can see that people expect that if e.g. \r\n`Get-ChildItem -Directory *`   returned items `Test-Path -container *` returns true , but I can't see anyone relying on the behaviour relying on the order of creation. (So a recursive copy might give different results from the source depending on copy order)\r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n",
