  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6?view=powershell-6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\ni got this code here for demonstration:\r\n\r\n`Invoke-RestMethod -uri \"https://XXXXXX.blob.core.windows.net/XXXXXXXX/XXXXXX/SOURCES/PE10.WIM?st=2020-02-20T13%3A08%3A43Z&se=2021-02-21T13%3A08%3A00Z&sp=racwdl&sv=2018-03-28&sr=b&sig=SIGNATURE\" -OutFile \"C:\\Users\\testUser\\Downloads\\DL\\PRG\\test.wim\"`\r\n\r\nwhen i use that code i can get the download.\r\nFirstly to maybe make clear what the parameter TimeoutSec  should do. i thought it the connection stops i get an timeout after 10 seconds? or do i get an timeout after 10 seconds when i cant get an answer ?\r\n\r\nTo the problem:  when i use that code above the download starts with Powershell 7. When i unplug my Lan cable when the download is already progressing, i can reattach the cable in maybe 10 seconds and the download resumes. when i leave it unpluged this happens:\r\n\r\nin Powershell 5: i get an timeout after 5 minutes. and the script goes on (thats what i want)\r\nin Powershell 7: nothing happens, waiting 5, 10 minutes, even hours (tested till 1 day) and its stuck. also the script is stuck and wont progress anymore\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n- after the connection is lost during an download (or cable is unpluged) a timeout should happen after 5 minutes, like it happens in Powershell 5\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n- Powershell 7 is stuck during the download when cable is unpluged. Script hangs forever\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
