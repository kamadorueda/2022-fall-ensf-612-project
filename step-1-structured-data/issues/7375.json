  "body": "Note: At this point I know of only one utility, `n`, the Node.js version manager, but I suspect other utilities are affected too.\r\n\r\nPresumably, the issue is related to programs using the \"alternate screen\" technique (as used by the `screen` utility and the `tput smcup` and `tput rmcup` commands)  described in [this SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/q/11023929/45375).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (macOS or Linux)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Install `n`, the Node.js version manager with 2 Node.js versions:\r\ncurl -L https://git.io/n-install | bash -s -- -q -n lts latest\r\n$env:N_PREFIX=\"$HOME/n\"; $env:PATH += \":$HOME/n/bin\"\r\nn  # Invoke n for interactive selection of the active Node.js version.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: Run `n-uninstall` afterward to remove both `n` and the installed Node.js versions.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nA menu with the two installed Node.js versions should be presented, and _the up/down arrow keys should allow navigating between the two._\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/588825/43344460-d1b3282e-91b7-11e8-8f7b-3347c5abb15d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe up/down arrow keys do not work (though Enter does).\r\n\r\nInvocation from `bash` does not exhibit the problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem is not PSReadLine-related, as even unloading it first makes no difference.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.1.0-preview.4 on macOS 10.13.6\r\nPowerShell Core v6.1.0-preview.4 on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS\r\n```\r\n",
