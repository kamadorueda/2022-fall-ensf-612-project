  "body": "Discussing this with @TylerLeonhardt.\r\n\r\nA number of applications and utilities use the process CWD information provided by the OS to do useful things. For example iTerm2 can follow your shell session's CWD in the title.\r\n\r\nI feel like there has been discussion of this before but can't provide it anywhere, so opening an issue.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is:\r\n\r\n- PowerShell has multiple runspaces, each of which can be in a different location at the same time\r\n- Therefore PowerShell should expose its CWD as the location of runspace 1, since this is very likely to be the interactive runspace\r\n- This should be available as a simple API internally that is a no-op on other runspaces, and it should be executed beside whatever changes PowerShell's own concept of CWD.",

So setting CWD based on one of them is slightly arbitrary.\r\n- The current CWD setting is the .NET default of \u201cthe directory where the process was started\u201d, which is also useful information\r\n- The existing behaviour has been in for some time, and breaking it could cause issues\r\n",
