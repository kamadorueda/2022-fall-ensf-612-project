      "body": "I'm not familiar with these tests or the code they are testing, but, one fear I have about doing that kind of thing is if it is somehow referencing itself. if a corrupt version number is leaking into the PSSession, then the test will pass, even though the expected version is wrong. In that case, we should just remove the test as it wont provide any benefit. That is how we get tests that are passing even though the code is broken.",

      "body": "Is there a point to that test? What does it test? what is it verifying? why is it important?  Maybe it's better to remove this check. if it is just going to echo back the same version every time, is there any value in testing it? Is there any scenario where this would not have the same version? Is this version information significant in any way?\r\n\r\nTests are one area where I think it is OK have these kinds of literal tests. They provide more valuable information that way. If the same version just gets echoed back, testing against that same version it is no different than `$PSVersionTable.PSVersion | should be $PSVersionTable.PSVersion`",
