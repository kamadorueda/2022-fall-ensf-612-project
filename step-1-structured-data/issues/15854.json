  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWhen trying to run a non-PowerShell script whose filename extension is associated with a script interpreter, for example using the `cmd.exe` commands `ftype` and `assfoc`, the script extension (for example `.pl` for Perl scripts), this extension must be listed in the `PATHEXT` environment variable in order for this script to be run in the *same* console as the one from which the script was started (if the script is started without specifying the interpreter executable). If this extension is not listed in `PATHEXT`, PowerShell will open a new console and run the script in this new console. (See also [this Stackoverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/68606397/180275) and  [its accepted answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68607090/180275)).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nI would have expected the script to be run in the current console regardless of its extension being listed in `PATHEXT`.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nExecuting the script opens a new Console\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nnone\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.19041.1023\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.19041.1023\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "Encountered the same behavior. I consider it a bit surprising, given that PowerShell behaves differently from `cmd` here.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure it's an issue, it could be an intended behavior, but I'd love to see it documented and hear a rationale for why it works this way. I don't see why I'd want to have a file type associated with a console application, but open it in a new console window.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the original purpose of PATHEXT is different (which extensions are looked up in PATH when a native command is specified without extension), and PowerShell adds a different, mostly unrelated purpose (which extensions open in the current console window), which is a bit odd.",

      "body": "The Engine WG discussed this issue today.  \r\n\r\nThe current behavior is by design however, we agree that documentation is needed (assuming it's not already documented in the help somewhere).\r\n\r\nRationale:\r\nPowerShell is using `PATHEXT` to determine if a file is executable on Windows.  This usage is documented [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc737438(v=ws.10)) on the Microsoft Docs site.  It says:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177512/141396308-838d9011-166a-4619-ba26-941f2d0dab50.png)\r\n\r\nWhen PowerShell determines that a file is not executable then it hands it over to Windows via `ShellExecute = true` to process.  Windows handles looking up the file association and executing the default verb for the extension.  That may start Perl in a separate console, or open Excel with the given .xlsx file.\r\n\r\nThe prescribed solution for this is to add the extension to `PATHEXT`.  Of course, you can also invoke the interpreter directly e.g. `perl hello.pl`.  Note: once you've added `.PL` to `$env:PATHEXT`, you can invoke it with just `.\\hello` unless there is another `hello.bat|exe|com` in the same dir and those extensions appear before `.PL` in `PATHEXT`.",
