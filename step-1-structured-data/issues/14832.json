I'm having a bit of a hard time trying to identify the correct path for the test file.\r\nI can create a pull request if you give me a little push in the right direction.\r\nI think it should be under `test/` (in singular), and then under `test/powershell/` but then I'm not sure where it should be, as there is no matching directory for `System.Management.Automation`.\r\nThank you in advance for your time!",
