      "body": "Hi @Yousha. I'm assuming that you are missing the necessary dependencies because you indicated \"no updates\" in the environment data section. Our downlevel packages have dependencies on components beyond what we ship. You can either install the \r\n[VC++ redistributable package](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/installation/windows.md#msi) directly or install the [Universal C Runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50410).\r\n\r\nI recommend installing the Universal C Runtime to resolve this issue. It is packaged and distributed by Microsoft as an optional package via Windows Update, so you will pick it up automatically if you fully patch your Windows 7 system.",
