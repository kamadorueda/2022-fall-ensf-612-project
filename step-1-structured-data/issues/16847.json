  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. install an older version of PowerShell, e.g. [release 7.1.5](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.1.5).\r\na. Choose a unique path, e.g. `C:\\PowerShell\\7.1.5` (which installs to `C:\\PowerShell\\7.1.5\\7`).\r\nb. Installer _PowerShell 7-x64 Setup_ settings (though these should not affect this bug occurring)\r\n\u2611Add PowerShell to Path Environment Variable\r\n\u2611Register Windows Event Logging Manifest\r\n\u2611Enable PowerShell remoting\r\nc. Note the contents of the installation path (default `C:\\PowerShell\\7.1.5\\7`) has the installation files, i.e. the following command will run `C:\\PowerShell\\7.1.5\\7\\pwsh.exe`.\r\n2. install a newer version of PowerShell, e.g. [release 7.2.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/tag/v7.2.1)\r\na. Choose a unique path, e.g. `C:\\PowerShell\\7.2.1` (which installs to `C:\\PowerShell\\7.2.1\\7`).\r\nb. Installer _PowerShell 7-x64 Setup_ settings (though these should not affect this bug occurring)\r\n\u2611Add PowerShell to Path Environment Variable\r\n\u2611Register Windows Event Logging Manifest\r\n\u2611Enable PowerShell remoting\r\n3. run the old version, i.e. command `C:\\PowerShell\\7.1.5\\7\\pwsh.exe`.\r\nThe command fails with:\r\n`C:\\PowerShell\\7.1.5\\7\\pwsh.exe: The term 'C:\\PowerShell\\7.1.5\\7\\pwsh.exe' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.`\r\nThe old PowerShell installation was unexpectedly removed.\r\n\r\nThis can be reproduced in a Windows Sandbox instance.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPowerShell installer should either:\r\n- ask the User installing if they would like to remove prior PowerShell installations (if \"yes\" then specify which ones)\r\n- just not remove prior PowerShell installations\r\n\r\nSystem-wide unique settings, i.e. settings that can only point to one instance of PowerShell, e.g. _Enable PowerShell remoting_, should be overwritten by the last run PowerShell installer.\r\n\r\nSome Windows users may want multiple PowerShell installations side-by-side.\r\nEspecially developers testing PowerShell scripts on multiple versions of PowerShell.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPrior PowerShell installations are removed despite not being requested by the user.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\PowerShell\\7.2.1\\7> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Remove the \"Upgrade\" table to prevent the MSI from removing previous versions. I don't know if that really works, as the MSI may have been designed under the assumption that previous versions are always removed, but it could be worth a try. ",
