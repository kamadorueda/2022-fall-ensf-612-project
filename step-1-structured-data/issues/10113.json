Parameter sets themselves (their \"shape\" and contents, so to speak) are a public API (they affect how a cmdlet can be used, therefore removing / significant changes to an existing set can be breaking), _but_\r\n2. The internally-recorded **name** for any given parameter set isn't something people should be relying upon.\r\n\r\nI hope that makes it a bit more clear?\r\n\r\nWith regards to S.M.A.Internal, I'd agree it should probably be explicitly mentioned as some of the types and members there are public and usable from PS itself, so the nature of the contract in that area should be clarified. Not sure if @SteveL-MSFT wants to make a separate decision on appropriate wording / additions there. \ud83d\ude42 ",

The parameter sets themselves are considered a public API and those changes would be breaking.  As for SMA.Internal namespace, it is by definition not a public API even though can be called without reflection.  We don't document those APIs and users should not depend on them not changing.  Seems like `internal` shouldn't need to be called out explicitly.",
