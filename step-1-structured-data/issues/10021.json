  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Add some .cs files with things you are working on that don't happen to be tracked yet.\r\n1. Invoke `Start-PSBuild -Clean` to kick off a clean build process.\r\n1. Your untracked files are deleted without warning or prompt, and they don't even go into your recycle bin.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`Start-PSBuild -Clean` should not delete untracked source files without prompt by default (which `git clean` does). That is a really poor decision. I just lost a good chunk of work because of that behaviour, and now I'm losing time trying to get it back. All I wanted was a clean build (i.e. remove any temporary build files, and then rebuild). I did _not_ want to remove files I happen to have in my file system that may be important to me.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAny untracked files you have are removed without warning and without even going to the recycle bin.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nIrrelevant, but I happen to be invoking `Start-PSBuild` in Windows PowerShell 5.1.\r\n",
