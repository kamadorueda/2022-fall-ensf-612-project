  "body": "In #13409 we enhance WebSslProtocol enum with Tls13.\r\n\r\nAfter investigations of new test failures I found that .Net delegates the TLS support to underlying OS. The TLS 1.3 support on all OS-s is limited.\r\n\r\nAs result we put theTls13 tests at pending.\r\n\r\nAfter most of current OS versions will support Tls13 well we should activate these tests.",
