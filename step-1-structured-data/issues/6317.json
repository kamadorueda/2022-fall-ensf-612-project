  "body": "As agreed in [PR 6301](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6301), preview releases should have a different icon to distinguish it from the production version and avoid people accidentally using the preview version.\r\nFor the daily builds I already changed it using the code [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/tools/install-powershell.ps1#L162) to use the [Powershell_av_colors.ico](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/assets/Powershell_av_colors.ico) icon:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9250262/36993175-06b144b8-20a5-11e8-8a96-c850bd366649.png)\r\n\r\nThe only remaining icon is [Powershell_avatar.ico](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/assets/Powershell_avatar.ico):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9250262/36993205-1a3065f0-20a5-11e8-8d1b-946d8fbc7bd5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore I suggest that the preview should use the [Powershell_av_colors.ico](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/assets/Powershell_av_colors.ico) icon instead now and the daily builds should start using the  [Powershell_avatar.ico](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/assets/Powershell_avatar.ico) icon instead.\r\n\r\nI think, preview builds (produced e.g. by AppVeyor) should also have a different icon and I will leave it up to the maintainers which of the 2 icons to choose or if a new icon should be used for those.",
