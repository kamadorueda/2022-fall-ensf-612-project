  "body": "Hi, I have a simple application written in c# for .NET Framewrok 4.6  that hosts a RunspacePool that is initialized with maximum runspaces to 5 and minimum to 2.  Everything works fine, commands get executed at decent speed. However, when I start 20 instances of that application on the same machine, it gets very slow for even only one application ( one runspacepool)  to run commands. \r\n\r\nWhen I start my application alone (not all the 20) and I start PowerShell ISE or PowerShell at the same time, I see a significant increase in the startup time, even thought they are not loading any module. \r\n\r\nThen comes my question,\r\n\r\nAre Runspacepool sharing some kind of state or objects between processes ? \r\n\r\n",

      "body": "The only shared state is a file based cache of the commands exported by modules - it is not specific to any host or runspace pools, so your host should benefit from this cache.\r\n\r\nI suggest you use [perfview](https://github.com/Microsoft/perfview) or [Windows Performance Toolkit](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/commercialize/test/wpt/index) to analyze the performance and compare what's happening in your host versions regular powershell.\r\n\r\nOne thing to look for is how much time is spent in the JIT.",
