Current behavior allows:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nstart-process ping -wait -nonewwindow -argumentlist \"-n 2\", \"localhost\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere all elements of `-ArgumentList` is simply joined into a single string forming: `ping -n 2 localhost`.\r\n\r\nWe can't start treating them as individual arguments since there is no way to determine what the user intended and arbitrarily add quotes or separating them into individual args.",
