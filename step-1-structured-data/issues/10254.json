  "body": "I am not sure when this broke, but it works correctly on Windows PowerShell 5.1.  It may have been when removing workflows and workflow jobs.  Debugging single jobs still appears to work however.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$ss = (nsn),(nsn),(nsn)\r\n$job = Invoke-Command -Session $ss -ScriptBlock { 1..100 | foreach { sleep 1; \"Output: $_\" } } -asjob\r\n$job | Debug-Job\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nBreak into the debugger and step through each running job as breakpoints hit, similar to debugging multiple threads in a traditional code debugger.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nDebugger break occurs in a single job, but stepping through the code doesn't work, and it is not possible to exit without breaking the console (prompt no longer works).\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks @iSazonov. I saw this when it was logged, and took a quick look then. It isn't apparent to me when this stopped working or what change broke it. Also, since Windows PowerShell is not open source, I unfortunately can't go read the old code and build/step through it to see how it used to work. I would like to see this fixed though, so may cycle back to it later if I have time to do so.",
