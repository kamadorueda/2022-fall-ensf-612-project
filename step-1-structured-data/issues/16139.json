  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate a script e.g test.ps1 with the following contents\r\n\r\n```\r\nWrite-Warning \"This is a warning\"\r\nWrite-Progress -Activity \"Progress\" -PercentComplete 100\r\nWrite-Warning \"This is a warning\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun this script with the following command `pwsh test.ps1 > mac.txt` on macOS (probably Linux distros as well I just haven't tested)\r\n\r\nRun this script with the following command `pwsh test.ps1 > win.txt` on Windows (tested on Windows 10)\r\n\r\nI have attached the files that are produced from the commands above.\r\n\r\n[mac.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/7215286/mac.txt)\r\n[win.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/7215287/win.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nThe files contain the same content similar to below as shown in the windows output from above\r\n\r\n\r\nWARNING: This is a warning\r\nWARNING: This is a warning\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n[win.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/7215287/win.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nBased on the file content above (and linked below) you can see the mac version has lots of whitespace between the two warning messages and the second warning isn't on a new line as expected.\r\n\r\nWhereas the file produced on Windows outputs as I expect it to.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[mac.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/7215286/mac.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nOn macOS\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.4\r\nOS                             Darwin 20.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.6.0: Mon\u2026\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nOn Windows \r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
