I even uninstalled all customization and rebooted computer\r\nand reinstalled everything all over again and still get that problem.\r\n\r\nWhen ANY of the PowerShells first load up, the very first line does this.  And when you press enter,\r\nthe second line comes out clean and looks proper.  as shown here.\r\nIts just that first line thats always the problem.\r\n\r\n![Screenshot_90](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18384135/148316461-773e2c17-cadb-47d1-b5da-7ad75b7819b8.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
