  "body": "The macOS install package should adopt a proper [Uniform Type Identifier (UTI)](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/understanding_utis/understand_utis_conc/understand_utis_conc.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40001319-CH202-CHDHIJDE). Current this is just `powershell`. `fpm` offers a `--osxpkg-identifier-prefix` which would add a reverse domain such as `com.microsoft`, final UTI would be `com.microsoft.powershell`. Perhaps even the suffix should be different, e.g powershellcore.\r\n\r\n/cc @TravisEz13\r\n",

      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT I would have to agree with @TravisEz13 but we should do some testing to ensure that is the case. The desire is to have 6.0 have fixed UTI for its lifecycle, whether that is the existing `powershell` or a new UTI. If the UTI was changed post release then updates and bug fixes get installed as side by side. I wouldn't think that is the desired experience. An update/bug fix should replace the existing installation. A new minor version would be a side by side, e.g. 6.1 or whatever we determine are the break points.",
