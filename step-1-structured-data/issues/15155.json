Run `Get-Counter -Counter \"\\Processor(_Total)\\% Processor Time\" -Continuous`\r\n3. `Get-Counter` shows a 5-10% discrepancy with Task Manager\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`Get-Counter` should show the right CPU usage\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`Get-Counter` is showing a good 5-10% discrepancy with Task Manager CPU consumption. \r\n\r\n![Test2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3397477/113520787-e172e080-9595-11eb-991d-8d41e52e0fea.gif)\r\n\r\nThis is particularly bad because  `Get-Counter`  is the official command that [Microsoft suggest for DTU calculation](http://dtucalculator.azurewebsites.net/) before migrating to Azure SQL DB. \r\nCheck the PowerShell script on the same page.\r\nThis means that DTU calculation is possibly suggested with a good 5-10% of error. \r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.19035.1\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.19035.1\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```\r\n",
