In 2016, I also saw someone submitting an issue. Is anyone willing to help continue to develop?\r\n\r\n`robocopy` is not a part of `cmd` but a separate standalone application. It doesn't make sense to make a \"powershell\" version of it. You could certainly write a version in PowerShell that uses the native File APIs, but that would be reinventing the wheel.\r\n",

It would be nice to have a PowerShell equivalent so you can work with objects, but the reality is that if there is a native command that works, it wouldn't make sense to spend time on an equivalent cmdlet vs spending that time on addressing some other issue.",

I'd rather spend team resources on enabling new scenarios and use cases vs porting something that works today (perhaps not ideal) just to make it PowerShell-y.  Would love to see the community pick up this type of requests.",
