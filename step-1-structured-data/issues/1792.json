  "body": "The test `use of a module from two runspaces` set `/tmp/<guid-number>` in `$env:PSMODULEPATH`. However, the file `/tmp/powershell` somehow exists in the Travis CI build machine. So when the test create a powershell object by `[powershell]::create()`, the module path calculation logic incorrectly believed that `/tmp/<guid-number>` is a PSHome module path derived from parent process and thus removed it.\n\nThe detection of a derived PSHome module path could be smarter, it's tracked in #1744\nThis PR will resolve the failure from the test side, so that our build can be fixed.\n",
