  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nWhen $ErrorView is set to NormalView (or CategoryView), error text color changes from red to white. When checking the current value of $Host.PrivateData.ErrorForegroundColor it reports Red. It is possible to change the variable value but it has no effect in NormalView and CategoryView.\r\nIn ConciseView everything works as expected.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nError text color should be the same as the $Host.PrivateData.ErrorForegroundColor value.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nError text color is white whatever color you set to $Host.PrivateData.ErrorForegroundColor.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n![2021-12-22 092221](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36552933/147060204-e4b1fe22-159d-442c-8d57-2232533aabf5.jpg)\r\n![2021-12-22 092831](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36552933/147061218-e4c40a58-7a30-4570-8e00-52650146eb45.jpg)\r\n\r\n",
