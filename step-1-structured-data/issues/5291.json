  "body": "Notable change this time around.\r\n\r\n* Values set by script are \"unset\" in `Info.plist` by default to prevent conflicts if a fresh clone.\r\n* After packaging `CFBundleIdentifier` is set to random value to prevent it from being picked up by installer. An empty value could not be used because native defaults doesn't allow it.\r\n* The magic here is getting macOS to recognize the change in the plist file. `plutil` is enough to make this happen.\r\n\r\nFixes #5262",
