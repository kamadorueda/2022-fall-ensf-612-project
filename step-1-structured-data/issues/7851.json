  "body": "Per the [comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4962#issuecomment-333342220) on #4962, paging was at some point intended to be fixed by 6.1.0 -- this is not the case, as such.\r\n\r\nChecking the contents of `$function:help` indicates that *some* effort was made for the help system specifically (it utilises `less` on Linux, and `more.com` on Windows), but `Out-Host -Paging` does... nothing, in those cases (long strings of text aren't interrupted to page, etc.)\r\n\r\nIt *does* work with lengthy sequences of objects, *but* even there the paging is... not at all pretty. Unlike how `more` or `less` function, it leaves... useless prompt strings in the host display after they've been skipped past, duplicates the prompt after the first full page, and overall doesn't make enough of an effort to distinguish itself from the rest of the output, in my opinion. Image is below; partial host output from a call to `gci c:\\ -recurse -depth 2 | out-host -paging`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32407840/45927943-99c16780-bf09-11e8-8412-71c22593c051.png)\r\n\r\n`Out-Host -Paging` should mimic the behaviour of `more` and `less`. As [this unfortunate soul discovered](https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/9hyh8v/i_must_have_screwed_up_more_literally/e6he82z/?context=3) `more.com` does have cases where it *completely breaks* non-Latin character encodings (though it is perfectly capable of reading them from a file). \r\n\r\nAnd, arguably, the `more` function should return as a function that simply maps to `Out-Host -Paging`\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# windows\r\ngci c:\\ -recurse -depth 2 | out-host -Paging\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n*similar behaviour to `more.com` or `less`*\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd-----         7/1/2018  12:33 AM                8336500659725115574\r\nda----        8/16/2016   4:57 PM                adb\r\nd-----        9/16/2018   6:40 PM                AMD\r\nda----         9/9/2016  11:27 AM                Android\r\nd-----        9/24/2015   5:38 PM                EFI\r\nd-----         4/7/2018   6:39 PM                ESD\r\nd-----        3/16/2015   1:35 AM                Intel\r\nd-----         5/3/2018   6:48 PM                Logs\r\nd-----        9/27/2015  11:57 PM                My Backups\r\nd-----         9/8/2018   5:23 AM                PerfLogs\r\nd-r---        9/16/2018   6:39 PM                Program Files\r\nd-r---        9/16/2018   6:39 PM                Program Files (x86)\r\nd-----        3/17/2015   9:12 PM                Python34\r\nd-----         9/4/2017   8:34 PM                Ruby24-x64\r\nd-----         7/6/2018   1:23 PM                test\r\nd-r---        9/16/2018   6:39 PM                Users\r\nd-----       11/29/2016  12:32 AM                VIA_XHCI\r\nd-----        9/16/2018   6:46 PM                Windows\r\nd-----        9/16/2018   6:48 PM                Windows.old\r\nd-----         6/1/2018  12:28 AM                Windows.old(1)\r\n-a----        3/17/2015   5:49 AM        4194304 BIOS.17.03.15.bak\r\n-a----         4/6/2018   6:05 PM          17005 PS5.1help.csv\r\n-a----         4/6/2018   6:04 PM           5535 PSCoreHelp.csv\r\n-a----         4/6/2018   6:22 PM            328 WinPSTopics.txt\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\adb\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\n-a----        10/9/2015   5:58 PM         944128 adb.exe\r\n-a----        10/9/2015   5:58 PM          96256 AdbWinApi.dll\r\n-a----        10/9/2015   5:58 PM          60928 AdbWinUsbApi.dll\r\n-a----        10/9/2015   5:58 PM         318464 fastboot.exe\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\AMD\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\nd-----         2/4/2018  11:12 AM                Packages\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\nd-----       12/12/2017   8:43 PM                PPC\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\nd-----         2/4/2018  11:12 AM                radeon-software-adrenalin-18.2.1-minimalsetup-180201_64bit\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\nd-----       12/12/2017   8:36 PM                Win10-64Bit-Radeon-Software-Adrenalin-Edition-17.12.1-Dec11\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\nd-----        9/16/2018   6:40 PM                WU-CCC2\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\n-a----         2/4/2018   9:20 AM           2647 atikmdag_dce.log\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\n\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\n\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\n    Directory: C:\\AMD\\Packages\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\n\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\n\r\n<SPACE> next page; <CR> next line; Q quit\r\n```\r\n\r\nLots of added clutter that does not clean up after itself.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17758\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "`less` in PowerShell does not create backpressure like `Out-Host -Paging`. Imagine you have a cmdlet that reads and outputs huge amount of data. Piping it into `Out-Host -Paging` will make sure the cmdlet will only read as much data as is actually visible on the page, and create backpressure until the user scrolls down. Also, when quitting, the cmdlet's execution will be aborted. This is extremely useful for commands that stream large amounts of expensive-to-compute data (basically, all commands where you would want to use a pager).\r\n\r\nBoth do not happen with `less`. Pipe the cmdlet into `less`, and it will keep reading and outputting more and more data (potentially from an infinite data source!) that gets sent to less and buffered in memory by `less`. When quitting `less` nothing actually happens if the cmdlet didn't terminate yet, you need to Ctrl+C it manually.\r\n\r\nProof:\r\nDefine this function:\r\n```powershell\r\n$i = 0\r\nfunction test() {\r\n  while ($true) {\r\n    $global:i++\r\n    $global:i\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nNow run `test | Out-Host -Paging`, wait a bit without scrolling, and quit.\r\nCheck `$i` in the terminal. It should be the last number that was on screen, e.g. 32.\r\n\r\nNow run `test | less`, wait a bit without scrolling, and quit. Ctrl+C to terminate the cmdlet (needed).\r\nCheck `$i` again. It will be a huge number like 6574, because the cmdlet kept producing output even though the user did not scroll further.",

While I realize that the different platforms have different paging tools, to me, this is not an acceptable experience.

More on Windows is different than More on Linux is _probably_ different than More on Mac.  And of course Less is different and not present on Windows.
