  "body": "Sorry if this is the wrong place, I created an issue https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/7765 but I am not sure its an issue with Chef. I am not very familiar with Powershell sorry, so I am unable to replicate without Chef (If I knew how it would be handy to try and replicate with pure WinRM).\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce \r\n------------------ \r\nIn Chef \r\n```powershell \r\ncd C:/Test \r\nAdd-AppxPackage Example_1.0.0.0_x64.appx -DependencyPath \"Dependencies\\\\x64\\\\A.appx\",\"Dependencies\\\\x64\\\\B.appx\",\"Dependencies\\\\x64\\\\C.appx\" \r\n``` \r\nThis is trying to install an appx for a standard user. I believe Chef uses WinRM to run the commands.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior \r\n----------------- \r\n```none \r\nApp installs. Testing the command when physically logging in as the standard user and running powershell, it does work (appx installs). \r\n``` \r\n```powershell \r\nget-appxpackage -allusers -name *example* \r\n(result is empty) \r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior \r\n--------------- \r\n``` \r\nWin32 internal error \"Access is denied\" 0x5 occurred while reading the console output buffer. Contact Microsoft Customer Support Services. \r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data \r\n---------------- \r\n```powershell \r\nName Value \r\n---- ----- \r\nPSVersion 5.1.17134.228 \r\nPSEdition Desktop \r\nPSCompatibleVersions {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...} \r\nBuildVersion 10.0.17134.228 \r\nCLRVersion 4.0.30319.42000 \r\nWSManStackVersion 3.0 \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion 2.3 \r\nSerializationVersion 1.1.0.1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes \r\n---------------- \r\nI have tried everything I can think of, the only thing that works is starting another powershell script as the user (see the ticket on Chef). Please see https://github.com/chef/chef/issues/7765 for more details.",
