  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6?view=powershell-6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Create and send a [multi-line code snippet](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/send-code-snippets-in-a-message-in-teams-5406fe2b-2771-4b9a-bd73-656914f6ab3c) in Microsoft Teams\r\n2. Copy the code snippet from Teams (can be from either Teams desktop app or [https://teams.microsoft.com](https://teams.microsoft.com))\r\n3. Paste the code snippet into either Pwsh.exe or PowerShell.exe\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$date = Get-Date\r\n$date\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n* Code is pasted in the same order it was copied\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$date = Get-Date\r\n$date\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n* Code lines are reversed\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$date\r\n$date = Get-Date\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\nI could not replicate this behavior on macOS and was not able to test on Linux. I also tested pasting into many other applications and did not observe the text order being reversed, so I believe this is a PowerShell issue and not a Teams issue (Notepad, Notepad++, Word, Command Prompt, Teams).\r\n\r\n* Windows 10 1909 10.0.18363.778\r\n* Microsoft Teams 1.3.00.8663\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",

Right-click to paste also got the order right, but omitted the newline (which I believe is a known limitation in that form of paste).\r\n\r\nSome followup questions:\r\n\r\n- How are you copying?\r\n- How are you pasting?\r\n- Are you running normal pwsh.exe in the conhost (as in my screenshot), or are you running it in another terminal emulator (like Windows terminal or Hyper)?\r\n- ~~Does this also occur with powershell.exe?~~ See that this is the case\r\n- Does this also occur with the current PowerShell preview (7.1.0-preview.2)?\r\n- Does this occur for you on any other machines?\r\n- Does this occur with any other Electron applications, like VSCode or Slack, or possibly Chrome?",
