  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am trying to run powershell core on a live booted CentOS 7. The NFS of the System is running on a dedicated Server and is read-only that multiple clients can access the NFS at the same time.\r\nI tried the newest versions stable, lts and preview. None of them seem to work on read-only filesystems.\r\n\r\nQuestion is: Is there a way to run Powershell Core on read-only FS, e.g. by manually setting up the environment properly?\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Setup PXE Server using https://github.com/bertvv/ansible-role-pxeserver\r\n2. Setup NFS using https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/diskless-nfs-config\r\n3. Install Powershell on the exported NFS with\r\n`sudo yum install powershell --installroot=_exported-root-directory_ --releasever=/`\r\n4. Connect to Live booted client and run `pwsh`\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nPowershell starts\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62539851/77311661-d3db1780-6d00-11ea-9d55-a0d5b8731e6a.png)\r\n\r\nExtract of `strace -f pwsh-preview`\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62539851/77311764-07b63d00-6d01-11ea-8a68-3e190a5590b8.png)\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nPackage installed: powershell-preview-7.0.0_rc.3-1.rhel.7.x86_64.rpm\r\nCentOS 7\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "\r\n**First**, .NET Core runtime creates pipes for managed debugging, when the runtime starts up.\r\n> ... pipes for managed debugging in /tmp. They are named something like \u201cclr-debug-pipe-17206-65823754-out\u201d, \u201cclr-debug-pipe-17206-65823754-in\u201d where 17206 is the process id and 65823754 is the process creation time.\r\n\r\nYour screenshot shows the failure of creating the pipes. For details, see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/7204\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/77346070-dafb2900-6cf2-11ea-9323-9456538ab9a3.png)\r\n\r\nThis step can be disabled by executing `export COMPlus_EnableDiagnostics=0` before start the .NET Core program. See https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/pull/15878 for details.\r\n\r\n**Second**, the update notification feature added in pwsh 7 requires writing to the disk. But you can disable it by executing `export POWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK=Off` before starting pwsh.\r\n\r\n**Third**, the `PSReadLine` saves command line history to a file. This can be disabled by running `Set-PSReadLineOption -HistorySaveStyle SaveNothing` right after starting pwsh I guess.\r\n\r\n**Fourth**, the module analysis in PowerShell saves the analysis results to a cache file. This cannot be disabled, but the failure of writing to the cache file will be tolerated by pwsh.\r\n\r\n**Fifth, ~this one might be a hard blocker.~** pwsh also creates a pipe for debugging purpose when starting (attach to a running pwsh process), and obviously, this will fail on a read-only file system. ~It's very possible this failure will terminate the process.~ Just got @PaulHigin's response on this: `PowerShell still runs if the named pipe cannot be created.  It just won't be able to use IPC.`\r\n\r\n### Given above, it's possible to run pwsh on a read-only file system, and you can try it out and share your observations.",
