For the second object the custom formatting is ignored.\r\n\r\n# Cause\r\n\r\nI think the issue is in `Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Internal.Format.InnerFormatShapeCommand.ProcessObject()`\r\n\r\nThis method is called for each object. The first time, `ctx` is `FormattingContextState.none`, and so `_viewManager.Initialize` is called with the first object (`so`), and based on that object type the custom view is selected.\r\n\r\nOn the second call, `ctx` is now `FormattingContextState.group`, so `_viewManager.Initialize` isn't called, and so there's never an opportunity to set the select object's custom view.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.6-119-g0dfeeb52034faf2696dc8844b5cbf39faba566cb\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

For heterogeneous collections, the format to use is selected based on the first object (what properties to show etc.) Subsequent objects just get converted to strings (?).

The solution is to have a common base class for the objects being emitted and write your formats against that.",

      "body": "The default output is pretty ugly, so what I was trying to do was format it. My Provider writes out containers and items, and I was just trying to make the container display with brackets (\"[...]\") in the output.\r\n\r\nFor example, I created a trivial custom provider to debug with, with this ps1xml file (notice that the first view has a <FormatString>):\r\n\r\n```\r\n<Configuration>\r\n  <ViewDefinitions>\r\n    <View>\r\n      <Name>Class1</Name>\r\n      <ViewSelectedBy>\r\n        <TypeName>TestPSPCore.TestClass1</TypeName>\r\n      </ViewSelectedBy>\r\n      <WideControl>\r\n        <ColumnNumber>1</ColumnNumber>\r\n        <WideEntries>\r\n          <WideEntry>\r\n            <WideItem>\r\n              <PropertyName>Name</PropertyName>\r\n              <FormatString>[{0}]</FormatString> <!- <<<<<<<<<< -->\r\n            </WideItem>\r\n          </WideEntry>\r\n        </WideEntries>\r\n      </WideControl>\r\n    </View>\r\n\r\n    <View>\r\n      <Name>Class2</Name>\r\n      <ViewSelectedBy>\r\n        <TypeName>TestPSPCore.TestClass2</TypeName>\r\n      </ViewSelectedBy>\r\n      <WideControl>\r\n        <ColumnNumber>1</ColumnNumber>\r\n        <WideEntries>\r\n          <WideEntry>\r\n            <WideItem>\r\n              <PropertyName>Name</PropertyName>\r\n            </WideItem>\r\n          </WideEntry>\r\n        </WideEntries>\r\n      </WideControl>\r\n    </View>\r\n  </ViewDefinitions>\r\n</Configuration>\r\n```\r\nNow I do a gci, which returns one of each type (named \"1\" and \"2\"), and expect to get\r\n\r\n```\r\n[1]\r\n2\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1\r\n\r\nPSPath        : TestPSPCore\\TestPSPCore::\\2\r\nPSParentPath  : TestPSPCore\\TestPSPCore::\\\r\nPSChildName   : 2\r\nPSDrive       : tpsp\r\nPSProvider    : TestPSPCore\\TestPSPCore\r\nPSIsContainer : False\r\nName          : 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nI did work around it with a common base class. That means that you have to modify the objects to have a custom formatter though. If it's necessary for the object to be designed to be formatted, then what I'd really like is to be able to set a [PSOutput] attribute or some such on a property, and then that's what's used by default to output the object. Or is there a way to cause the ToString() to be used to format the object?\r\n",
