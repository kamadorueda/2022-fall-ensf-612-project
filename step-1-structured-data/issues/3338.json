  "body": "Team,\r\n\r\n**System**: Windows 10 + Anniversary update, PS 5.1.  \r\n\r\n**Issue**: Install-Module cmdlets completes successfully but the installed module is not found after installation. After a short research I've found that the $env:PSModulePath variable doesn't contain the installation path (in this case \"C:\\Users\\<username>\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\").  The variable $env:PSModulePath is not modified by the user. Adding the path to $env:PSModulePath resolves the issue. Let me know if you need more information.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNedko",

      "body": "@f0rt This looks like a problem with your `PSModulePath` rather than PowerShellGet. \r\n\r\nThe default state of `PSModulePath` is for the system variable to point to `%SystemRoot%\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\\`, and the user variable should not exist. At runtime, we prepend `$env:PSModulePath` with `C:\\Users<username>\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules;C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules`. \r\n\r\nIf that's not happening on your end, I'd really appreciate some more info on:\r\n* how you're launching PowerShell (is it from a shortcut on the taskbar or the start menu? Or is it from the Start->Run/Win+R?) \r\n* What your system and user environment variables for PSModulePath look like, preferably from the System GUI, e.g. \r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1255187/24052989/b112d6d2-0af4-11e7-9180-cd276c94212b.png)\r\n\r\n",
