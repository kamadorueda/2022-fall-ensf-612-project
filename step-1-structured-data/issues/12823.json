  "body": "The third time a child process prints to STDERR causes pwsh to fail when using the `windows-latest` runners on GitHub Actions.\r\n\r\nThe script stops execution and pwsh returns exit code 1.\r\n\r\nNote, [the runner prepends `$erroractionpreference='stop'`](https://github.com/actions/runner/blob/11435857e4cd9795fa5ee68c20b674e5f96052ab/src/Runner.Worker/Handlers/ScriptHandlerHelpers.cs#L57) which may help explain why execution halts. Although does not explain why the third line STDERR line causes an issue.\r\n\r\nUsing pwsh 7.0.1\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n[Here is the small repro](https://github.com/ericsciple/testing/blob/179117882d8f9d1a17076a771fdc46ad376ce710/.github/workflows/main.yml) on GitHub Actions\r\n\r\n[Here are the logs](https://github.com/ericsciple/testing/actions/runs/117482086) from the failed run\r\n\r\nWhat is strange, is it succeeds for me when using a self hosted runner. Both machines are using pwsh 7.0.1\r\n\r\nIs there any way to turn on diagnostic logging for pwsh? Also could try a private build with additional logging. The runner uses pwsh from the PATH, so would just need to download it during the workflow-run, extract, and add it to the PATH using [this runner command](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#adding-a-system-path)\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nhello \r\nworld \r\naaaa \r\nbbbb \r\ncccc \r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nhello \r\nworld \r\naaaa \r\n##[error]Process completed with exit code 1.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
