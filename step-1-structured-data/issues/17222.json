  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Download the MSI for v7.2.2 and run it.\r\n   a. Use a custom directory (in my case I choose `D:\\PowerShell`)\r\n   b. Untick the options to update automatically through Windows Update or WSUS.\r\n2. Now download the MSI for v7.2.3 and run it.\r\n3. When you reach the page for the installation directory, it shows the default directory in `C:\\Program Files`.\r\n4. When you reach the page for automatic updates, both options are ticked.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe installer for a new version should respect the options that were selected for the previous verison.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe installer for a new version uses the default options.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Related Issues\r\n\r\nThis could be related to #17211, which is about the original installation directory not being respected when PowerShell is automatically updated through Windows Update.",

      "body": "Can confirm..\r\n\r\nI'd also like to add that this is not some kind of regression, I've observed this behaviour in the MSI installer packages at least since PowerShell Core version 6.something\r\n\r\nBut the thing is, remembering the previously used installer settings would mandate to store that information somewhere in the local system, like the registry or something else..\r\n\r\nThe upside is that the installer can be considered clean in the way it behaves right now.. \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nAlso, just out of curiosity, what is the convention or the consensus on installing PowerShell in a custom location like that?\r\nI mean, I'm doing it as well, and I've never encountered any issue related to filesystem locations, but is there some kind of \"official\" guideline that would serve as a recommendation?",
