  "body": "The `Set-PSBreakpoint` command allows you to set a breakpoint multiple times. Most users never encounter this because if they debug and use breakpoints, they do so from Visual Studio Code or PowerShell ISE. For users who use the command line and set breakpoints that way, this behavior leads to additional breakpoints being created that are not necessary and do not add any value to their debugging experience.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-PSBreakpoint -Command Get-Process\r\nSet-PSBreakpoint -Command Get-Process\r\nSet-PSBreakpoint -Command Get-Process\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n  ID Script                            Line Command                           Variable                          Action\r\n  -- ------                            ---- -------                           --------                          ------\r\n   0                                        Get-Process\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n  ID Script                            Line Command                           Variable                          Action\r\n  -- ------                            ---- -------                           --------                          ------\r\n   0                                        Get-Process\r\n\r\n  ID Script                            Line Command                           Variable                          Action\r\n  -- ------                            ---- -------                           --------                          ------\r\n   1                                        Get-Process\r\n\r\n  ID Script                            Line Command                           Variable                          Action\r\n  -- ------                            ---- -------                           --------                          ------\r\n   2                                        Get-Process\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Desired outcome\r\n\r\nI would like to change this behavior such that `Set-PSBreakpoint` does not create duplicates, by having it look at existing breakpoints when a breakpoint is set. If an exact match is found, that breakpoint is returned to the caller. Otherwise, the new breakpoint is set and returned to the caller. There is no value in allowing multiple breakpoints that are 100% identical to be set in a debugger. In fact, graphical debuggers don't allow you to do this, so the command line shouldn't either.",

My point was that if you're setting a breakpoint that is already set _the exact same way as an existing breakpoint_ (same line/column/command/variable/script/action), then that should just give you back the breakpoint that is already set. When working from the command line using PSReadline's `Ctrl+R` or just up arrow to `Set-PSBreakpoint` commands between sessions, it's easy to set a single breakpoint twice the exact same way. That's what I want to prevent.",

Looks like the impl reflects the desire to have multiple breakpoints with different actions/commands/variable but nobody bothered to check if those actions/command/variable are actually different.  BTW, in your example with `Get-Process`, it doesn't actually break three times, does it?",
