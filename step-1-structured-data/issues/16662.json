Many of the common ones, like Pipe tables from Github Flavored Markdown, are used very frequently instead of HTML in markdown.\r\n\r\nAllowing the advanced features to be available would greatly increase this command's usability with Github related markdown content and many other popular variations. \n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
