You can't really guarantee compatibility of anything you don't provide yourself, but that isn't really new with Core.  That said, most assemblies will not be relying on private field names, this is an outlier.\r\n\r\n>   * Or is the loading smart to limit itself to assemblies found to indicate .NET Core compatibility? (With the only problem at hand being the one you've explained.)\r\n\r\nNah there's no way to tell if an assembly is compatible without manual testing.  Also not .NET Core specific.\r\n\r\n> * What, if anything,  can a user do to control this behavior? (If the loading is smart, there may be no need for such a feature).\r\n\r\nSome options, all except the first are sorta complicated:\r\n\r\n* Ship your own copy of the assembly with your module/script/etc\r\n* Custom `AssemblyResolve` event\r\n* Custom `AssemblyLoadContext`",

Some assemblies there at least do _load_ in .NET Core if targeted by their full path (their types are listed with `Add-Type -PassThru`).\r\n\r\nOh, I didn't expect that PS would have it's own logic to [crawl the GAC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/6b5d6a0075ea87577f658504b66a28464b362258/src/System.Management.Automation/CoreCLR/CorePsAssemblyLoadContext.cs#L331).  The [Fusion](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/unmanaged-api/fusion/) API should be considered instead.  I'm guessing the current implementation was due to COM interop not being supported at the time, but it is with 3.0.\r\n\r\n> What determines which .NET Framework assemblies .NET Core can use?\r\n\r\nWhether they use any API's that were removed or had breaking changes.  Again not so much specifically a framework vs core thing, though a lot more removals and breaks did happen.\r\n\r\n> My previous understanding was that only .NET Standard assemblies were also usable by .NET Core.\r\n\r\nUsually when you see someone say they have to \"write a version for netstandard\" it really means they depended on something that broke.  If none of the API's they used happened to change, it'll often work fine.",

The standard is just a declaration of API surface that the different runtimes commit to supporting (or at the very least not throwing JIT time errors for).\r\n\r\nIt's sort like how you can technically use the PS 5.1 version of `PowerShellStandard.Library` to write code for PSv3.  As long as you only actually use API's that also exist in PSv3, it'll be fine.  It's just sort of dangerous because you don't get compile time errors for API's that don't exist in your target.",
