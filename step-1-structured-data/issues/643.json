I think it\u2019s desirable to make sure that any necessary changes to OMI get into the upstream OMI and we use the existing OMI packages for this. Is that consistent with your plans?\n",

But you need to be careful on how to configure OMI to work with our products. Otherwise, you can have an OMI that installs into \"our\" directory (/opt/omi), yet it won't work with our products. That would be a disaster.\n\nThere are only two places that I'm aware of where this is actually built: SCX and DSC.\n\nBoth are fairly light-weight projects. If you just did a \"configure --enable-ulinux; make\" in SCXcore, you'd get what you needed. But if you were willing to check out SCXcore, I could give you a few targeted commands to JUST build OMI.\n\nIs that enough for you? Or do you need something more?\n\nWhat if you took any of the output packages up on the build share for SCX, and ran the shell bundle with `--extract`. If you did this, you'd get an up-to-date version of OMI as well (from the master branch).\n\nI'd suggest you stop by, tell me exactly what you need, and I'll work with you to satisfy your needs.\n",

My goal is to get an OMI \"2.0\" Debian package that the PowerShell package and @paulcallen's PSRP provider can take a dependency on. Thus a `master` branch build isn't enough; I need to make one for the `psrp/features` branch (and be able to make new ones as it gets updated).\n\nIt sounds like OMI is incapable of producing its own packages, is this something we can remedy?\n",
