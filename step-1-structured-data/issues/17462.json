In my view, a -p [path] argument would make configuring powershell much much easier.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "Does it process all four profile files? Or does it run only the first one it finds, akin to $env:PATH? The second one seems by far the more logical to me... And running something like pwsh --profile C:\\blah\\blob.ps1 is hardly any overhead over using the default (hardcoded) profiles... if anything, having a command line argument is 1/4th the time it would take to run four different files...\r\nThanks for the workaround, I'll give it a shot anyway",
