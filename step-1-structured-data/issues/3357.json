      "body": "The `====` and `---` styles only allow two levels of heading past that you must use the other style.  So using this style promotes inconsistency.  It leads to other issues such as people using emphasis instead of headings if people are not aware of the other style.  Not following proper markdown syntax can lead to some parsers not being able to parse the document.  This is shown as I made syntax fixes the Travis-CI spelling checking found more spelling fixes.\r\n\r\nI also don't see any readability differences between the two styles and I think the `# Title` , `##  H1`, `### H2` style is much more editable.",
