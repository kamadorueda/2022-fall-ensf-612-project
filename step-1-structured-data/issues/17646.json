      "body": "The word \"support\" here will cause all manner of problems\r\n\r\nAs used by Microsoft \"Support\" means there is an ultimate backstop of \"If a bug is found, engineering resources will be used to produce a fix\".  If PowerShell 7.2 exposes a bug in Windows 7, the Windows team will not (usually) go back and produce a fix for Windows to correct it - exceptions _are_ made but usually only if there is a security aspect. \r\n\r\nWill PowerShell _work_ as expected on out of support versions of Windows ? Quite possibly, but the PowerShell team won't test on any versions which are out of support, so if there is something they do which fails on older Windows they won't change their code either.\r\n\r\nGenerally if you are using something which forces you to use out-of-support Windows (e.g. some piece of hardware or software which can't work with anything else) best practice is to consider that system frozen, and to take steps to protect it from exposure to threats which which new systems are defended from. \r\n \r\n ",
