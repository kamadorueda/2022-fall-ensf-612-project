  "body": "Assume that I have written a script which is a paragon of portability. It runs on all the platforms without modification, and is in my PATH. On Windows, I type:\n`PS> Hello`\nand it executes!\n\nshould I be able to do the same on non-windows platforms? Note that I have not typed the actual name of the file on Windows (which is `hello.ps1`), just `hello`.\n\n`#!powershell` does not address this issue, because it doesn't change the name of the script. Are we going to suggest that our users create 2 copies of the same file:\n`hello` and `hello.ps1`\none for Windows, another for not?\nare we going to require our users to type `hello.ps1` on non-Windows platforms?\n\nI suggest that we support our current behavior on non-Windows platforms, we supply the `.ps1`, and use the same disambiguation logic that we do for  `.cmd`, `.exe`, etc, which an additional ` ` which is no extension. This way if files (on non-windows)\n\n```\nhello\nhello.ps1\n```\n\nwe would execute `hello`.  _similar to what we would do if we found_ `hello.exe` _on windows_\nIf we find only `hello.ps1`, and the user types `hello`, we run it and not require the user to type the actual filename\n",
