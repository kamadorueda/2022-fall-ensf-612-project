  "body": "Currently when creating a service using the `New-Service` from the module `Microsoft.PowerShell.Management` I can specify the credentials that my new service will be executed with.\r\n\r\n`Set-Service` currently does not support setting the new logon account for the service.\r\nThe current workarounds that I have found:\r\n* Use sc.exe to change credentials\r\n* Use `Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service` and from there use the `Change` method\r\n* Delete the service and create it again.\r\n\r\nBut I believe it would be nice to have `Set-Service` support credentials.\r\nIs it possible to add functionality for setting the credentials using the `Set-Service` command?",
