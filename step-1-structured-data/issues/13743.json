However if I switch to the original console and start typing, the characters start to appear in the new console, one by one.\r\nThen, the issue reverts, and I stop being able to write in the original console until I type in the new console.\r\nIt looks as though there's only one buffer.\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
