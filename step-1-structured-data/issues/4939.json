  "body": "Currently, PowerShell uses the same ETW provider GUID as PowerShell on Windows. This presents a few, subtle problems:\r\n1: PowerShell 6 events cannot be easily distinguished from PowerShell/Windows.\r\n2: PowerShell 6 is relying on a valid ETW manifest being registered to ensure events can be decoded. This assumption breaks on down-level systems that do not contain PowerShell/Windows 5.X and also ties PowerShell 6 to PowerShell/Windows events.\r\nThe solution is as follows:\r\n1: Snapshot the PowerShell/Windows ETW manifest and update the provider GUID and Provider Name.\r\n> The Event viewer location should be moved outside the Microsoft/Windows event tree since PowerShell 6 does not ship inbox.\r\n2: Provide a script or MSI action to register the PowerShell 6 manifest either at install time or as a post install, user step to address xcopy deploy use cases.\r\n3: Document the updated Provider GUID, name, and any registration steps (if appropriate)consumers.",
