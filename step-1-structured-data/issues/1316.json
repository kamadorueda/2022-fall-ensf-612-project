  "body": "<!-- PR checklist -->\n- [ ] Resolves #1080 (I think)\n- [ ] Code is up-to-date with `master`.\n- [ ] Add tests that fail without your changes.\n- [ ] Update all relevant [documentation](../docs).\n\n<!-- Provide more details about the PR below -->\n\nThe initial port of PSReadLine to LINUX ignored the fact that PSReadLine would also run under CORECLR on Windows.  I've fixed that, so most of the Windows specific capabilities of PSReadLine have been restored, with the notable exception of access to the clipboard.\n\nI also introduced a new implementation of the IConsole interface to simplify the differences b/w using conhost vs. a tty.\n\nRemaining work (I will create issues for these):\n- Guard Windows P/Invokes under LINUX (b/c they are useless)\n- Bring back clipboard support under CORECLR\n- Improve perf on LINUX by not writing character by character (at a minimum, writing substrings that all have the same colors, better would be to use escape sequences and a single write)\n- Remove the scraping of the prompt, it doesn't actually work on Linux and only slightly simplifies rendering.\n",
