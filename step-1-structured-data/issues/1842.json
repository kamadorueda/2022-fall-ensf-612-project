  "body": "Currently the alpha.9 packages hosted are named according to the correct conventions; however, the packages themselves were not regenerated. This means that `apt-cache show powershell` shows the version `6.0.0-alpha.9`, when the correct version (according to the package's filename) is `6.0.0-alpha.9-1ubuntu1.14.04.1`. Similarly, `yum info powershell` shows `1` for the release, when it should show `1.el7.centos`.\n\nThis will be resolved for the alpha.10 packages, but @raghushantha and I will not be replacing the current packages, as they've already been distributed.\n\n/cc @wimcoekaerts  \n",
