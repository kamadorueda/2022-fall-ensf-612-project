      "body": "The issue here is that `echo -n \"bar\"` is calling `Write-Output -NoEnumerate -InputObject \"bar\"` and piping that to the native binary `xsel`. It seems like PowerShell's default behaviour when sending a string to a binary application is to add the newline. I'm not sure if there is a way to change this behaviour.",
