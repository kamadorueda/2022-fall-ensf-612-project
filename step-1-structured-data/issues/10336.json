  "body": "this is the implementation of https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/249e8d88eb779a6003fd138609ae94417ae13698/2-Draft-Accepted/RFC0036-AdditionalTelemetry.md \r\n\r\n# PR Summary\r\n\r\n* Add Telemetry in the following areas\r\n  * When execution occurs, the ApplicationType will be captured as a metric\r\n  * When a module is loaded, capture a metric of the module name if it's in the allow list.\r\n  * When `PowerShell.Create` is used, send a metric\r\n  * When an experimental feature is activated send a metric (this is at startup only)\r\n  * Update startup telemetry to measure the type of shell startup (remote/ssh)\r\n* Added a couple of new fields to the StartUp telemetry\r\n  * `Channel` allows us to understand when PS is being used in a docker instance and what the OS is.\r\n  * Added a unique identifier which allows us to determine unique users. It's a generated guid which is persisted to disk.\r\n  * Added a unique identifier for the shell session\r\n\r\nI added an internal member to `System.Management.Automation.Platform` called `CacheDirectory` which makes it easy to find the location of the cache directory. I think this should probably be public, but that can be decided at a later time.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nWe knew that our initial telemetry was just that. The bare minimum of information to determine whether the shell was actually being used and on what platform. The additional information we think we need is captured in the RFC.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
