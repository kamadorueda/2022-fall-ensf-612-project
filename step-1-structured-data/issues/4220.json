  "body": "Placeholder for now as I follow up on some customer scenarios: it would be really nice to have a cmdlet that could validate JSON before it's used as input. I'd expect for something like this to already exist in Newtonsoft.Json. \r\n\r\nIMHO, it's a nice-to-have for 6.0.0 depending on how we're looking with `HighPriority` over the next couple months. If not, we could move it out to 6.1.0 without a real problem. \r\n\r\nAlso, this would require an RFC. ",

      "body": "Along these lines, how about a `Test-Xml` / `Format-Xml` set of cmdlets?  These are implemented in PSCX in C# and could probably be ported over now that .NET Core 2 has support for XML Schema.  The `Test-Xml` cmdlet's utility is fairly self-evident but perhaps that is less so with `Format-Xml`.  The latter command is very handy when you have an XML file that is a single line and 4000 chars wide.  :-)  It is also handy when attributes are scattered about.  A formatter can also put attributes on a new line.  In general it makes the XML output easier to read e.g.:\r\n```\r\ngc foo.xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?><doc><assembly><name>VBFormsApp</name></assembly><members></members></doc>\r\n```\r\nbecomes:\r\n```\r\nformat-xml foo.xml\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n<doc>\r\n  <assembly>\r\n    <name>VBFormsApp</name>\r\n  </assembly>\r\n  <members></members>\r\n</doc>\r\n```",
