The PSW team is moving to Git in  three to four  months.~~\n\nVSO create date - 4/23/2015 11:31:00\n\nRequirements:\n- Daily sync so we can integrate more frequently with the other PowerShell teams\n- Available as a (private) repo on GitHub (replacing [psl-monad](https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-monad))\n- We need at least the `monad/src` folder that was in the `admin` depot\n- We may want to sync all of `monad` for FullCLR to use `dotnet-cli`\n- We also need `wmi/WMIv2/Client/DotNetAPI/cs`, but _nothing_ else in WMI\n",
