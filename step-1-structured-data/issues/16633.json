  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIn Linux, the script is not called from the Prompt function. Exactly the same function in Windows works without problems. Is there any limitation? This was working good an year ago. The script is a Christmas tree on which toys change their colors at each iteration of the Prompt function.\r\n```\r\n# simplified\r\n\r\nfunction Prompt {\r\n\" > \"\r\nhny\r\n}\r\n```\r\n![ss-20211216152253](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78153320/146371395-85de3923-a5b6-4aaa-9abf-83d7e246d071.png)\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nScript has to be called.
