The profiles shall be placed in  PowerShell Core specific directories and have PowerShell Core specific names. Additional code will be needed to load the profiles from the new locations. Mostly it looks like a task to IFDEF the components of the name and path to be appropriate for PowerShell Core.\n# New Profiles\n\nName = PowerShell Core File and path\nAllUsersAllHosts = $PSHome\\profile.ps1\nAllUsersCurrentHost = $PSHome\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1\nCurrentUserAllHosts = ~\\Documents\\PowerShell\\profile.ps1\nCurrentUserCurrentHost = ~\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1\n",

In our terminology, `Windows PowerShell` means powershell for full desktop, so I get that we should change any `WindowsPowerShell` to `PowerShell`. But powershell core is still Microsoft powershell, not? Are we saying that `Microsoft PowerShell` also indicates powershell for full desktop?\n",

The profile files are tied to the host name (for ISE it is Microsoft.PowerShellISE_profile.ps1), since we are not changing the host name for console host, no need to change the profile file name.
