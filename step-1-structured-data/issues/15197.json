Also, name resolution is (invariably) case-_insensitive_. The same applies to _nested_ type names referenced in the list of type arguments when referring to a closed generic type. \r\n\r\n* As an additional simplification, PowerShell allows omitting the explicit arity (e.g., `` `2 ``) when referring to a _constructed_ generic type (one with the type parameters instantiated with specific types), as PowerShell then _infers_ the arity from the number of type arguments.\r\n\r\n* To illustrate the above with an example: to get a reference to the closed [constructed] generic type that in C# you could refer to as `IDictionary<string, int>`:\r\n    * In .NET notation (for use as strings with `[Type]::GetType()`):\r\n        *  ``System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary`2[[System.String], [System.Int32]]`` or, with the optional `[...]` around the type arguments removed:\r\n        * ``System.Collections.Generic.IDictionary`2[System.String, System.Int32]``\r\n    * In simplified PowerShell type-literal notation:\r\n       * ``[Collections.Generic.IDictionary[string, int]]``  (`System.` omitted, explicit arity omitted, use of type accelerators as the type arguments)\r\n\r\n ",
