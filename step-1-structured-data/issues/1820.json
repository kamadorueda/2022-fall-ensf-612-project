  "body": "First off I want to say well done for such a tremendous undertaking. For those of us who have not been with the party since it started, and so that I can help frame expectations and shape the narrative I would be very interested to know what main PowerShell features that we've come to expect in the Windows world, that will NOT be a part of the initial alpha for Linux and OSX platforms. These would be features that you expect to officially support but will not initially be available.  Or at least I would hope you would include this material in any release notes.\n",
