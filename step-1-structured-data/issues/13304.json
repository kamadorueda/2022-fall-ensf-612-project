[The .NET Framework version](https://github.com/IronLanguages/main/tree/ipy-2.7-maint/Runtime/Microsoft.Dynamic/ComInterop).\r\n   The code was archived in 2012.\r\n\r\n2. [The .NET 5.0 version](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/tree/master/src/libraries/Microsoft.CSharp/src/Microsoft/CSharp/RuntimeBinder/ComInterop).\r\n   It was merged into .NET 5.0 in May 2020 through the PR [dotnet/runtime#33060](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/33060).\r\n   It's based on the .NET Framework version code with quite amount of refactoring work.\r\n\r\n3. [The legacy ComInterop code from Windows PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/v7.0.0/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/ComInterop).\r\n   The legacy code has always been in the repository, but it was excluded from compilation.\r\n   It was based on the .NET Framework version code with a considerable amount of refactoring work to make it work properly with Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\n### Code Refreshing\r\n\r\nThe ComInterop code was refreshed and enabled in compilation in PowerShell 7.1, August 2020.\r\nIt was done manually by:\r\n\r\n- A careful **three-way comparison** across all the code sources listed above:\r\n  - Compare (3) to (1) to get the PowerShell specific changes\r\n  - Compare (2) to (1) to get the .NET 5.0 changes\r\n\r\n- Applying the PowerShell specific changes from (3) to (2), with necessary further refactoring\r\n\r\n- A careful review of the new PowerShell specific changes applied to (2), again using the three-way comparison:\r\n  - Compare the refreshed ComInterop code with (3) to get the differences\r\n  - Analyze the differences to make sure they are either the pure .NET 5.0 changes over the .NET Framework code,\r\n    or the refactoring changes that is necessary to apply the PowerShell specific changes.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

Both the expression interpreter and the COM binder code are archived components in .NET, there is no activity in those components (except for the needed changes to get them in .NET Core/5.0).\r\n2. It's not a sheer copy of the .NET code. There are additional PowerShell specific changes to those code in PowerShell repo. Take [this commit](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13304/commits/373116c613f6b533c05d4120c241cb23eaf6fb3e) as an example to see the PowerShell specific changes to COM binder on top of the .NET 5.0 code.",

Is C# scripting future? :-)\r\n\r\n`archived` means the code is relatively pretty stable and there is no new feature planned for the component. It doesn't imply `obsolete` -- bringing back COM binder in .NET 5.0 is a clear evidence that the com binder is supported.\r\n\r\nFor the expression interpreter, `System.Linq.Expression` and `Microsoft.CSharp` are where the code lives, and they are now the archived components. But those 2 libraries are obviously important building blocks for many other components.\r\n\r\nHere is the area doc if you are interested: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/master/docs/area-owners.md",
