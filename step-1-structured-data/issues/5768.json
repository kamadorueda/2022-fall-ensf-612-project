  "body": "I'm experimenting with monitoring `$Error` during unit testing to validate commands' non-terminating error behavior.  The scope rules that `$Error` follows seem rather peculiar.  Neither [`about_Automatic_Variables`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_automatic_variables?view=powershell-6) nor [`about_Scope`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_scopes?view=powershell-6) seem to explain this behavior.  I found some discussion about `$Error`'s behavior in modules in [this @BrucePay post](https://stackoverflow.com/a/11457624/1404637).  That post is from 2012 so I'm wondering whether it's still valid.  If it is still valid, I'm not entirely sure how to interpret that post: \r\n1. Is the non-global `$Error` meant to contain a log of only the module's errors?  \r\n2. Is the non-global `$Error` entirely vestigial and should be altogether avoided?\r\n3. How should I monitor non-terminating errors originating from a module from within that module?  `$Error`?  Some filter of `$global:Error`?\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction e {\r\n    Write-Error 'e'\r\n    Write-Host \"e: $($Error.Count)\"\r\n}\r\nNew-Module {\r\n    function f {\r\n        Write-Error 'f'\r\n        Write-Host \"f: $($Error.Count)\"\r\n    }\r\n    function g {\r\n        param(\r\n            [System.Collections.ArrayList]$ErrorRef\r\n        )\r\n        Write-Error 'g'\r\n        Write-Host \"g: $($ErrorRef.Count)\"\r\n    }\r\n} | Out-Null\r\n\r\n\r\n$Error.Clear()\r\nWrite-Error 'outer'\r\nWrite-Host \"outer: $($Error.Count)\"\r\n\r\ne\r\nf\r\ng -ErrorRef $Error\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n(I have omitted the error stream here.)\r\n```none\r\nouter: 1\r\ne: 2\r\nf: 3\r\ng: 4\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n(I have omitted the error stream here.)\r\n```none\r\nouter: 1\r\ne: 2\r\nf: 0\r\ng: 4\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value                                            \r\n----                           -----                                            \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-rc.2                                       \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                             \r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-rc.2                                      \r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 6.3.9600                       \r\nPlatform                       Win32NT                                          \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                          \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                              \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                          \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                              \r\n```\r\n",

That advice doesn't seem consistent with [this MSDN article](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714412(v=vs.85).aspx) (and [@mklement0's pragmatic summary thereof](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9294949/when-should-i-use-write-error-vs-throw-terminating-vs-non-terminating-errors/39949027#39949027)).  Each of those recommends using non-terminating errors in certain cases.  It seems that unit testing for non-terminating errors would naturally involve `$Error`.  Is there some other method of unit testing for non-terminating errors that I should consider?",

      "body": "`$Error` is populated by more than just the immediate code (nested code can populate it) and some misguided nested code will even clear it. Also, there are the scoping issues you mentioned with regards to modules. All in all, I just find `$Error` to not be very reliable. It's a handy tool when you are in the console, but I would never personally write code that depended on it or tests that run against it.\r\n\r\nFor testing non-termination errors, in this project as well as others usually involves toggling the error action preference (either the automatic variable or the via advanced cmdlet parameter) and then passing the script block to `Should Not Throw` and/or `Should Throw`. Another way is to make use of the `-ErrorVariable` parameter.",

      "body": ">For testing non-termination errors, in this project as well as others usually involves toggling the error action preference...\r\n\r\nThat seems pragmatic as a first approximation.  Converting non-terminating to terminating errors, however, significantly affects control flow especially where the pipeline is involved.  The case where control flow and non-terminating errors both matter is probably an edge case for most commands, but I'm finding that that's an edge case I need to test.  That's why I'm interested in `$Error`.",

      "body": "@alx9r There is also `$?` which I had to use for special cases in the past to check for non-terminating errors (a different approach would be change the `ErrorAction` to `Stop` inside a try block and then access the error using `$_.Exception` in the catch block). Maybe that could help you but not sure.",
