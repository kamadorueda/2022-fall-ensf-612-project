      "body": "@sizur - I'm with you here. I don't think it is a conflict at all; it seems to be an expansion of the call operator's capabilities. I asked for this functionality way back in 2007, but it couldn't be justified. Then powershell 2's modules came along and muddied the water. Right now, the call operator can be used with strings, scriptblocks and moduleinfos (what @bpayette said). Extending it to handle PSMethods should be doable.\r\n\r\nIIRC, I told the powershell team that \"& should be able to call All the Things\"",

      "body": "@sizur The expression is currently parsed as:\r\n```powershell \r\n& ($foo.bar) cmd args...\r\n```\r\nwhich should effectively result in \r\n```powershell\r\n& <executionContextObject> cmd args...\r\n```\r\nIt also currently supports CommandInfo objects\r\n```powershell\r\n& (get-command getdate)\r\n```\r\nOtherwise, the value is converted to a string and used as the name of the command to run:\r\n```powershell\r\n& (\"get-\" + \"process\") -name csr*\r\n```\r\nSo while it is possible to special-case `MethodInfo` objects and treat the command line as a method call, this would be a (minor) breaking change. As to the utility of this change, I vaguely remember trying this out when I originally implemented modules and it didn't seem like it was worth the effort when you can just do\r\n```powershell\r\n$foo.bar(1,2,3) | some-thing...\r\n```\r\nNote that expressions are only allowed at the beginning of the pipeline. There is also an RFC out that addresses splatting/spreading for methods. Finally, if you do want to invoke a method in the pipeline, `ForEach-Object` already allows you to do that\r\n```powershell\r\n{master}PSCore (1:16) >  \"Hello world\" | foreach substring 2 3\r\nllo\r\n```\r\n (Aside: the other thing I considered was allowing you to assign MethodInfos to function table entries (converting them into some type CommandInfo) e.g.\r\n```powershell\r\n$function:sin = [math]::Sin\r\nsin 0.5\r\n```\r\nWhich I thought seemed promising but others disagreed :-)\r\n\r\n",
