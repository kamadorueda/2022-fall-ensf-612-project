  "body": "Because `xunit` tests are running now on Windows and not just Linux only, it would make sense to add it to `Powershell.sln` solution file.\r\nHowever, this does not work out of the box and needs some time to figure out how to adapt the `csproj` for that (it does not work out of the box with the upgrade that VS suggests). Any pointers on that?\r\nI have a working prototype in my branch [here](https://github.com/bergmeister/PowerShell/commit/d6e736274e98531d92d0d7bbeadd30804c28b13b), will open a PR",
