For those methods, we should switch to the official APIs once they become available in .NET Core.\r\n\r\nInstances: (not a complete list)\r\n`ClrFacade.ToBase64StringWithLineBreaks(byte[])` --> `System.Convert.ToBase64String(byte[] inArray, Base64FormattingOptions options)`\r\n\r\nFeel free to update this list when you spot one.",
