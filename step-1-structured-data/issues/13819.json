Without having a deeper look at the code paths involved, we're unsure whether there would need to be special casing applied to usage of hashtable-initialization syntax, which we feel maps closely to C# initialization syntax and should be permitted to set init-only properties (e.g., `[TypeName]@{ Property = 'value' }`)\r\n\r\nIn all other cases where users attempt to set init-only properties directly from PowerShell, we think PowerShell should prevent this, and throw a similar error to existing cases where a property is not publicly settable.",
