  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nWhen a charset is not supplied for a JSON response, the default encoding should be UTF-8 per RFC 8259. This PR changes the default charset to UTF-8 for JSON responses when a charset is not defined.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is a breaking change or not. If someone was running into encoding issues, they would already be converting `BasicHtmlWebResponseObject.RawContentStream.` If they were unaware, then this would just correct characters in their strings.\r\n\r\nCloses #5530\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nNote: Please mark anything not applicable to this PR `NA`.\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [X] Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [NA] User facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [NA] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- [ ] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n    - [X] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n",

      "body": "@iSazonov I need someone more experienced to make that call. Normally, the changes I deal with are more black-and-white on being breaking changes. This one is a bit of grey. This certainly changes the public behavior of the cmdlets. However, as I said the the description anyone who ran into this behavior is likely using a work around that would be unaffected by the change. The only user story I can come up with where this is a breaking change is where someone was purposely using the broken encoding... that's not a compelling story to me.",
