  "body": "# Overview\n\nIn PowerShell repo, there is a need to decouple as much as possible from PowerShell's existing dependence on the Windows registry. This requirement is driven by a lack of a registry in non-Windows environments and a need to isolate side-by-side instances of PowerShell from interfering with each other's operation.\n1. Two configuration file directories are needed\n   1. $PSHOME\\Configuration -- Holds HKLM registry values; \"System-wide\"\n   2. SpecialFolder.LocalApplicationData -- Holds HKCU registry values; \"per-user\"\n      - Windows = %LOCALAPPDATA%\\PowerShell\\Configuration\n      - non-Windows = ~/.config/PowerShell/Configuration\n2. Each registry key is a separate file\n   1. The file name is the key and the content is the value. All values are strings or easily converted to and from strings.\n   2. Preferred file format is JSON, but it may be unnecessary given one-key-per-file.\n   3. Positives\n      1. Mitigates multi-process reader & writer issues\n      2. Allows per-file access control\n   4. Negatives\n      1. More files to manage\n      2. May be unnecessary; no data to confirm whether it is an actual performance bottleneck\n# Values Needed:\n## PSModulePath\n\nExisting Key = HKLM:\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Session Manager\\Environment\nProposed value = %ProgramFiles%\\PowerShell\\Modules by default\n## DisablePromptToUpdateHelp\n\nExisting Key = HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\nProposed value = Existing default. Probably \"0\"\n## PipeLineMaxStackSizeMB\n\nExisting Key = HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\nProposed value = Existing default. Probably \"10\"\n## ConsolePrompting\n\nExisting Key = HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\nProposed value = existing default. Probably \"1\"\n## ExecutionPolicy\n\nExisting Key = HKCU and HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShell\nProposed value = existing default execution policy\n## DefaultSourcePath\n\nExisting Key = HKCU and HKLM\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\PowerShell\\UpdatableHelp\nProposed value = blank. This should be supported though\n### Note: Storage of machine-level and user-level environment variables is still an open topic. We can store them in files, but we might want to leave them as-is (written to registry) in Windows.\n# Tasks\n- [x] Merge portions of the prototype code and add it to the build\n- [x] Write new class for reading from and writing to JSON files\n- [x] Replace calls within PS code to use the new interface\n- [ ] Write tests and verify functionality\n",
