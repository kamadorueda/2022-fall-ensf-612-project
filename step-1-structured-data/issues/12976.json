  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nPR #12179 added FromUnixTime parameter to the Get-Date command.\r\nIn PowerShell 7.1.0-preview.3, the following command causes an error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS /> Get-Date -Date -1 -FromUnixTime\r\nGet-Date: Cannot bind parameter 'Date'. Cannot convert value \"-1\" to type \"System. DateTime\". Error: \"String '-1' was not recognized as a valid DateTime.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command should support negative unix time.\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu, the following commands will not return an error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ date --date \"@-1\"\r\nWed Dec 31 23:59:59 UTC 1969\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThe Date parameter of the Get-Date command has type [DateTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime). If an integer value is passed for this parameter, it will be interpreted as [Ticks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.datetime.ticks). This must be a positive value.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the following code is invalid.\r\n```\r\nPS /> [datetime] -1\r\nInvalidArgument: Cannot convert value \"-1\" to type \"System.DateTime\". Error: \"Ticks must be between DateTime.MinValue.Ticks and DateTime.MaxValue.Ticks. (Parameter 'ticks')\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnix time can take a negative value, meaning that it is before Unix Epoch.\r\n\r\nTo allow the Date parameter to take a negative integer value, the type of this parameter must be changed to long.\r\nBut this is a breaking change.\r\n\r\nI think the FromUnixTime parameter should be able to take a value, as was suggested in [#11719](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11719#issuecomment-581075598).",
