  "body": "This massively reduces the complexity of our build scripts, by using the `content` field of the Linux.Host's `project.json` file to deploy the files when publishing automatically.\n\nThis required adding the files to the tree, but as my commits note, this should not be an issue.\n\nThe Pester submodule was also moved, so after updating to this commit, `git submodule update` must be done (and likely `rm -rf test/Pester`).\n",
