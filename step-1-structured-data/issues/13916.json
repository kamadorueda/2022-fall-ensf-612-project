  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user, I want to be able to fail scripts automatically when $LASTEXITCODE becomes larger then 0 so that I can capture these as easy as errors I can capture with $ErrorActionPreference='stop'\r\n\r\nWhen external executables are called, we have to remember to add `if ($lastexitcode)` statements all over. As this is easy to forget, it can result in unexpected results. Furthermore, it pollutes code and depending on the setup, the script writer may not be aware of whether say a certain alias is a script or an external executables.\r\n\r\nThis will make error handling more uniform.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nWhenever an external command is executed (NativeCommandProcess.cs, I assume) and _nativeProcess.ExitCode != 0 && LastExitCodeErrorPreference == 'stop' stop the script like Write-Error does.\r\nThe exception thrown should contain the exitCode so that a catch construct can evaluate it in those cases where a non-zero value should be handled.\r\n",
