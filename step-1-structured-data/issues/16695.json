  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWhen using the Get-ChildItem cmdlet, I would expect -File to filter for only files, and when using -Exclude, these files should be possible to further filter. Instead when using the -File and the -Exclude parameters, no files are returned.\r\n\r\nThe problem is only reproducable with the -File parameter, not the -Directory parameter.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nGiven a folder with files \"a\" and \"b\", and a folder \"subfolder\":\r\n\r\nIf using `Get-ChildItem -File`: Both files should be returned, and the subFolder should not be returned.\r\nIf using `Get-ChildItem -Exclude \"a\"`: File \"b\" and folder \"subFolder\" should be returned\r\nIf using `Get-ChildItem -File -Exclude \"a\"`: Only file \"b\" should be returned\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nGiven a folder with files \"a\" and \"b\", and a folder \"subfolder\":\r\n\r\nIf using `Get-ChildItem -File`: Both files are returned, the subFolder should not be returned.\r\nIf using `Get-ChildItem -Exclude \"a\"`: File \"b\" and folder \"subFolder\" should be returned\r\n\r\nHowever:\r\nIf using `Get-ChildItem -File -Exclude \"a\"`: No files nor folders are returned.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNo errors are returned\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
