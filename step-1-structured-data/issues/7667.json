  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR updates tests for package validation.\r\nPrimary change is switching from constructing expected package filenames based on PS version to query the Azure Blob for actual packages that it has. This greatly improves reliability and makes test failure diagnostics much easier. This also removes 'special-case-code-paths' that were needed previously when constructing expected package filenames in some cases (e.g. opensuse).\r\n\r\nOther updates:\r\n* same set of dockerfiles used for both preview and stable packages;\r\n* renamed/changed dockerfile ARGs to be more flexible:\r\n** removed \"PSVERSIONSTUB\" in favor of \"PACKAGENAME\" that is found on Azure Blob\r\n** renamed \"PACKAGELOCATIONSTUB\" to \"PACKAGELOCATION\"\r\n** added \"PREVIEWSUFFIX\" that has to be \"-preview\" for preview packages\r\n** renamed \"TESTLISTSTUB\" to \"TESTLIST\"\r\n** removed \"GITLOCATION\" in favor of \"TESTDOWNLOADCOMMAND\" to have better control how tests are obtained (e.g. allowing to use PAT)\r\n* Config updates:\r\n** removed ubuntu17.10\r\n** added fedora28\r\n** added opensuse42.3\r\n** added ubuntu18.04\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [NA] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
