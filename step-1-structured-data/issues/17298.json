      "body": "That is normal behaviour\r\nThe parser reads this\r\n```\r\n$longText = \"Hi, I'm a very long string that likes to be broken down to several lines so that it fits\"\r\n  + \" within character limit nicely without horizontal scrollbars.\"\r\n```\r\nAnd sees the first line as complete.  So it assigns the string to the variable. Then it moves on to the next line\r\n\r\nif you have \r\n```\r\n$longText = \"Hi, I'm a very long string that likes to be broken down to several lines so that it fits\"  + \r\n```\r\nor \r\n```\r\n$longText = \"Hi, I'm a very long string that likes to be broken down to several lines so that it fits \r\n```\r\nor\r\n```\r\n$longText = (\"Hi, I'm a very long string that likes to be broken down to several lines so that it fits\" \r\n```\r\nThe parser sees that the + needs another operand, or the \" or (  needs to be closed  and sees one _logical_ line despite line break character(s)   this applies to any operator not just concatenation and arithmetic, the | or \",\" can be followed by white space and/or line break as can  -and , -eq etc.\r\n\r\nIf you don't want the  line break be seen as the end of a syntactically complete statement use `  as the last character before the line break - this causes the parser to ignore it, it must be the **last** character if there are spaces after the ` the first space is escaped and the line break still completes the statement..  \r\n\r\n\r\n",

The docs say it \"makes a number out of an object\" so it's basically trying to cast it to int. But yeah, most operators need to be on the previous line tell the parser to ignore new lines.",
