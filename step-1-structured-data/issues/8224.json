  "body": "`Where-Object -Property x` if given a property name it casts the value to bool and uses that as the filter test, but if given a method name it seems to check whether the method exists (getting the overload definitions and casting those to bool?), e.g.:\r\n```\r\n# filter out empty string, because Length 0 -> boolean false\r\nPS C:\\> \"test\", \"\", \"test2\" | Where -property Length\r\ntest\r\ntest2\r\n# try with getter method name, by comparison\r\nPS C:\\> \"test\", \"\", \"test2\" | Where -property get_Length\r\ntest\r\n\r\ntest2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feels inconsistent one way or another - if it should work with a method name, then it should call the method and use the return value, like `foreach-object -membername` does. But since the parameter is called `-Property` it should only take property names, and have another `-MemberName` property to work on arbitrary members.\r\n\r\nWith a wildcard:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\> \"test\" | where -Property L*\r\nwhere : Input name \"L*\" is ambiguous. It can be resolved to multiple matched members. Possible matches include: Length LastIndexOf LastIndexOfAny.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy is it matching a \"property\" wildcard to method names, when it can't use method names sensibly?",

      "body": "Good points;  to align the behavior with `ForEach-Object`, it seems to me  we could:\r\n\r\n* add a parameter _alias_  for the existing `-Property` parameter named `-MemberName` and make it support method names too.\r\n\r\n* add an `-ArgumentList` / `-Args` parameter to support passing arguments to method calls (in the implicit-Boolean-result scenario that would be fine; the syntax is perhaps a little confusing if an operator such as `-EQ` and operand (`-Value`) are also specified, but it should work).\r\n",
