There's a feedback link at the bottom of that page.\n\nThe PowerShell docs also have some [links to community resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/#community-resources) where you might be able to find more immediate help. The Discord group in particular is very active.\n\nAlso, some users in the past have gotten support for modules like this through their Microsoft Support partners I think (but that's not something I know much about I'm afraid).",
