  "body": "Note: Unlike #13677, Windows PowerShell exhibits the same problem.\r\n\r\n`Start-Transcript -Append` tries to _match_ the target file's existing character encoding.\r\n\r\nAs an aside: The built-in cmdlets are inconsistent with respect to this behavior: `Out-File -Append` does _not_ match the existing encoding, whereas `Export-Csv -Append`, `Start-Transcript -Append`, and `Add-Content` do.\r\n\r\nIn the _absence_ of a BOM in the target file, ASCII encoding is currently assumed, which results in the loss of non-ASCII-range characters, as they are transliterated to verbatim `?`.\r\n\r\nUTF-8 (by definition BOM-less, since a file is being _appended_ to) should be assumed and used instead.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# To surface the bug, make sure that the target file exists and doesn't have a BOM.\r\n'\u00e4' > temp:/$PID.txt\r\n\r\n# Start the transcript and *append* to the existing file:\r\n$null = Start-Transcript -Append temp:/$PID.txt\r\n'\u00fc' # output a string with a non-ASCII-range character\r\n$null = Stop-Transcript\r\n\r\nSelect-String -Quiet '\u00fc' temp:/$PID.txt | Should -BeTrue\r\n\r\nRemove-Item temp:/$PID.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, because `\u00fc` was transliterated to verbatim `?`.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.7\r\n```\r\n",
