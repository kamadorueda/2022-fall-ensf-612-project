WSman:\\Service\\CertificateThumbprint contains (in my case) the Thumbprint of the very first cert ever used with this machine, more than a week ago, also expired.  \n\nThe built in `winrm` command also seems to report the same cert, which was present when `winrm qc -transport:https` was first conducted.\n\n![](http://i.imgur.com/7NKzaRT.png)\n_Looking under wsman:\\Service, a Cert thumbprint from a previous test is visible_\n\nThe strangest part of the whole thing is that even though WinRM References out of date and invalid certificate information all over, somehow only the correct and new cert is being presented when new Winrm connections come in (such as via `Enter-PSSession -UseSsl`.  \n## Desired Change\n\nThe UI should correctly reflect the certificate thumbprint being used with WinRM, not refer to the original cert used to enable WinRM, as it does today.\n## Environment data\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\n> \nName                           Value                                                                                   \n----                           -----                                                                                   \nPSVersion                      5.0.10586.117                                                                           \nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                 \nBuildVersion                   10.0.10586.117                                                                          \nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.34011                                                                         \nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                     \nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                     \nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                                                                 \n\n\n\n\n```\n",
