  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAdd ability of `Write-Host` cmdlet to `Prompt` function. What is for? For example to support `/usr/bin/scp`. If default shell is pwsh it returns \"echoed\" output of prompt string that suppress scp. This could be like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPrompt\r\n{\r\n    Write-Host \"PS $($executionContext.SessionState.Path.CurrentLocation)$('>' * ($nestedPromptLevel + 1)) \" -NoNewLine\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs Write-Host supports esc-sequences it will be painless for end users who uses customized prompt.\r\n\r\nNowadays the Write-Host not working as expected. If to set it to prompt, prompt will be rewritten or extended with `PS>`",
