The idea of the information stream is that it is like the host stream, but something that you can capture. If / when people start using it a lot, it would be ugly to have \u201cINFORMATION:\u201d everywhere, just like it gets kinda confusing when people use the Verbose stream heavily and you end up ignoring the left quarter of the screen.\r\n\r\nSo the current behaviour is intentional.",
