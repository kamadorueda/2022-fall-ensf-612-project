  "body": "Have been trying for a long time to access SfBOnline Powershell from MacOS as I've already had to use a Windows VM to access this for years now. Powershell is available for Mac, but this doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI installed I've got over the WSMan error by installing the openssl 1.0.0 libraries, and the New-CsOnlineSession now works and authenticates properly - even using web based 2FA. However, it then errors with this:\r\n\r\nNew-CsOnlineSession: Connecting to remote server api.interfaces.records.teams.microsoft.com failed with the following error message : Client did not get proper response from server. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.\r\n\r\nThere is no help for this in the about_Remote_Troubleshooting doc. I can connect to ExchangeOnline fine, so it is just a Teams/SfBO issue. I guess from the URL that this is using the Graph API now but may need something else to get it working on Mac? ",
