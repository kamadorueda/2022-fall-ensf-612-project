      "body": "The idea in general could be worth pursuing. Worth mentioning though that `0b11 + 0b10` does not _convert_ anything, it's just displaying the value in decimal and not binary. Changing that would be quite a different story than just preventing conversions.\r\n\r\nThat said... having an operator affix that works _in general_ to prevent implicit conversions could be useful, not just for the `+` operator itself, but as a general affix for all arithmetic operators, at least. There might be _some_ use for the broader range of operators as well, but definitely for arithmetic operators it'd make a lot of sense, I think.",
