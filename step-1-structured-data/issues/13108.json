This looks like another bug in the 'GetPowerShell' method that tries to convert script text into equivalent PowerShell command/parameters.  The above workaround works because it causes the conversion to fail and the script text is sent to the target computer as is.  A fix for this may involve detecting a hash table parameter argument like this and failing the conversion.",
