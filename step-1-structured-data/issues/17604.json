  "body": "#17593\r\n\r\n### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nI'm creating a new Runspace inside a compiled cmdlet. I'd like to forward preference variables to the Runspace, so that e.g. verbose prints inside the created Runspace are shown if the caller of my cmdlet passes `-Verbose`.\r\n\r\nIn an advanced function, the preference variable is accessible as an ordinary `$VerbosePreference` variable. However, these are not available for a compiled cmdlet, where the streams are automatically managed. Is there a way to access the preference variable values, or automatically forward them to another Runspace?\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "@jhoneill This does not seem to work \u2013 in a compiled cmdlet, this gets the preference from the parent scope, meaning setting `$VerbosePreference = \"Continue\"` will work, but passing `-Verbose` will not (`.GetVariableValue(\"VerbosePreference\")` returns `\"SilentlyContinue\"`).\r\n\r\nTest code:\r\n```c#\r\nusing System.Management.Automation;\r\n\r\n[Cmdlet(\"Test\", \"VerbosePreference\")]\r\npublic class TestVerbosePreferenceCommand : PSCmdlet {\r\n    protected override void BeginProcessing() {\r\n        base.BeginProcessing();\r\n        WriteObject(GetVariableValue(\"VerbosePreference\"));\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly, `$PSCmdlet.GetVariableValue` works in an advanced function, but apparently not in a compiled cmdlet (I'd guess the variable is not set at all for the cmdlet, so it just inherits the value from the parent scope).",
