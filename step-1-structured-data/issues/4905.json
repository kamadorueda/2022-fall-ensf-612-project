  "body": "Unfortunately, there were some odd things coupled with this change that were all somewhat interdependent.\r\n\r\n* Adds `Delay` test to WebListener \r\n* Adds `-TestValue` parameter to `Get-WebListenerUrl` to support tests which take a value such as encoding, redirect, and delay\r\n* Adjusts existing tests for encoding and redirect to use `-TestValue`\r\n* Removes a repeated timeout test\r\n* Replaces httpbin.org/delay tests with Weblistener URL\r\n* Fixes the tests\r\n\r\nI discovered in switching this that the URL's that were being used (e.g. `http://httpbin.org/delay/:5`) were actually pointing to a page that immediately returned a `505` error. The pages were not actually delayed and the web cmdlets were not actually timing out. The tests were passing, but they were checking for the wrong Error ID. I had to correct the error ID in all the tests.\r\n\r\n~~Ironically, httpbin.org is having a ton of issues right now. I will push a feature tag later after they have stabilized.~~ Feature tag pushed.\r\n\r\nreference #2504 \r\n",
