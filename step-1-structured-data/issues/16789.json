  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nAs a PowerShell user for several users, I didn't realize until recently that you can select a row in Out-GridView and hit Ctrl+C to copy the row's contents. My intuition told me to try and right click to see if there was a menu item with an entry labeled `Copy (Ctrl+C)` like in most applications, but there never was so I never knew. It'd be nice if you could:\r\n\r\n1. Right click and have a context menu popup showing an entry for `Copy (Ctrl+C)`\r\n2. Rather than copying the whole row, it'd be event better if I could copy a single cell (or even be able to select several cells and copy their contents)\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
