  "body": "The `[Feature]` tag in a PR commit message doesn't reliably trigger full build on Travis CI because `travis.ps1` cannot reliably get the commit message of the PR commit. It could happen that the commit message in use is the commit that was just merged to master branch.\r\n\r\nSee example PR CI runs:\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/PowerShell/PowerShell/jobs/296488902\r\nThis CI build is for `\"Pull Request #5315 Always run test with crossgen'ed assemblies in CI\"`. However, when inspecting the log I see `\"Executing travis.ps1 $isPR='True' $isFullBuild='False' - Change line ending in Rename-Computer.Tests.ps1 to LF (#5314)\"`\r\n\r\nhttps://travis-ci.org/PowerShell/PowerShell/jobs/296488903\r\nSame here, it shows `\"Executing travis.ps1 $isPR='True' $isFullBuild='False' - remove sync-tags for Linux. It is failing. (#5299)\"`",
