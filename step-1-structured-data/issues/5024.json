  "body": "A manual step is required for install powershell on openSUSE (same as `dotnet-sdk-2.0.0`), so the current script that automatically set up powershell on OpenSUSE doesn't work. Filed #5023 to track this.\r\nTwo scripts are affected:\r\n- tools/download.sh\r\n   It will continue to install the beta.6 powershell openSUSE package.\r\n- tools/installpsh-suse.sh\r\n   It's already broken since beta.7, because we stopped publishing suse.42.1 package in beta.7 due its end of lifecycle.",
