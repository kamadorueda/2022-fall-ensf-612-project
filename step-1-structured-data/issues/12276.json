  "body": "# Encrypt Export-Clixml with a custom key similar to SecureString implementation\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a user I would like to be able to encrypt my full `Get-Credential` output with a custom key similar to how I can encrypt the password output with a custom key using ConvertFrom-SecureString. Currently it appears the encryption is tied to the user and the machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think it would make the most sense if the workflow looked something like this:\r\n```powershell\r\n#Create the key and the credentials\r\n$Key = New-Object byte[] 32\r\n[Security.Cryptography.RNGCryptoServiceProvider]::Create().GetBytes($Key)\r\n$Key | Out-File .\\keyfile.key\r\nGet-Credentials | Export-Clixml -Path .\\path\\to\\store\\creds.xml -Key $Key\r\n```\r\n```powershell\r\n#Import the credentials\r\n$Key = Get-Content .\\keyfile.key\r\n$Credentials = Import-Clixml .\\creds.xml -Key $Key\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
