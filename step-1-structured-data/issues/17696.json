  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHelp pages for `about_topics` are missing and cannot be downloaded on en-GB locale. Verbose output shows only redirects and zero downloads. Issue can be fixed by passing `-UICulture en-US` to `Update-Help`. I understand that the help pages are set to specific locale, but if it causes them to be completely missing in a different locale of same language, it's a bad user experience. Either show a warning \"Help pages for UICulture en-GB not found, but available in en-US, try calling with `-UICulture en-US`\", or just download them automatically. `Get-Help` already works with partial locale matches, just `Update-Help` needs fixing. \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> Get-UICulture\r\nLCID             Name             DisplayName\r\n----             ----             -----------\r\n2057             en-GB            English (United Kingdom)\r\n> Update-Help -Force -Verbose\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\n> Get-Help about_operators\r\nABOUT_OPERATORS\r\nShort description\r\nDescribes the operators that are supported by PowerShell.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n> Get-Help about_operators\r\nGet-Help: Get-Help could not find about_operators in a help file in this session.

When using implicit culture, it defaults to `Get-UICulture`, but with fallbacks as recursive parents. Parent of `en-GB` is `en`, so it returns `[ \"en-GB\", \"en\" ]`. Then when `HelpCultureNotSupported` is thrown in the implicit culture case, the exception is silenced to try and use fallbacks. Problem is that this silencing does not check if there are any more fallbacks, so if neither `en-GB` nor `en` can find help, command fails silently.\r\n\r\nI propose a fix to store the first exception of this type, then throw it at the end of the function if none of the languages succeeded. It is easiest, and provides the same descriptive error as when using explicit culture with no help. \r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// UpdateableHelpCommandBase.cs:511\r\n// `_language` holds `UICulture` because option used to be called `-Language`\r\n// `GetCurrentUICulture()` returns `[ \"en-GB\", \"en\" ]`\r\nvar cultures = _language ?? _helpSystem.GetCurrentUICulture();\r\n\r\n// UpdateableHelpCommandBase.cs:550\r\ncatch (UpdatableHelpSystemException e)\r\n{\r\n    if (e.FullyQualifiedErrorId == \"HelpCultureNotSupported\")\r\n    {\r\n        installed = false;\r\n\r\n        if (_language != null)  // DKASZEWS: true for implicit culture\r\n        {\r\n            // Display the error message only if we are not using the fallback chain\r\n            ProcessException(module.ModuleName, culture, e);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    else\r\n    {\r\n        ProcessException(module.ModuleName, culture, e);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n// UpdateableHelpCommandBase.cs:584\r\n// If -Language is not specified, we only install\r\n// one culture from the fallback chain\r\nif (_language == null && installed)\r\n{\r\n    break;\r\n}\r\n```",
