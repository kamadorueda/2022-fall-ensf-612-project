      "body": "The current cmdlet syntax is:\r\n```powershell\r\nEnter-PSSession [-ContainerId] <string> [-ConfigurationName <string>] [-RunAsAdministrator] [<CommonParameters>]\r\n```\r\nThe proposal would be to add a switch `DoNotUseWindowsPowerShell` to be able to use PowerShell Core. I know, the naming does not sound good (double negative, etc), but such a switch parameter is more useful as existing scripts can't be broken by changing the default and having to incorporate the word `PowerShell Core` in a ValidateSet is also not good if it gets renamed back to just `PowerShell` in the future. I am happy to take any suggestions",
