  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user automating with PowerShell, I would like to [pass options to OpenSSH](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh#o) when using PSRP over SSH as a SSH client, like `ssh -o GlobalKnownHostsFile=/Path/To/File`.\r\n\r\nCurrently, it seems only a [small subset](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/0e435a51432121f6c71fde081e2d18e0038b0e8a/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/common/RunspaceConnectionInfo.cs#L2066) of command line arguments for SSH are supported. \r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nA new parameter could be added to the Invoke-Command and New-PSSession cmdlets that would allow a dictionary of strings or a list of strings for configuration options.",
