  "body": "The ability to stop a pipeline on demand is currently only available _internally_, as used by `Select-Object -First <n>`, for instance.\r\n\r\nTo quote from [this uservoice.com issue](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell/suggestions/11087865-enable-users-to-stop-pipeline-making-stopupstreamc):\r\n\r\n> It is of great value to be able to stop the pipeline if your mission is completed before the emitting cmdlet has provided all results.\r\n>\r\n> In fact, the PS pipeline would gain a completely new \"feature\". Currently, it is a memory throttle and provides realtime feedback at the cost of performance. If stopping the pipeline was something available to users, it could also be a generic means of running cmdlets only partially.\r\n> \r\n> `Select-Object` is a great start but you do not always know beforehand how many elements you need. So it would be beneficial to have a `Stop-Pipeline` cmdlet or at least a public `StopUpstreamCommandsException` that a script programme can throw.\r\n\r\nA [real-world example](http://stackoverflow.com/a/34800670/45375).\r\n\r\nAlso note that there are **two distinct ways to \"stop\" a pipeline**:\r\n\r\n* Exiting the entire pipeline _instantly_ (effectively aborting it) -  with downstream cmdlets _not_ getting a chance to run their `End` blocks, as simulated by this command using `break` with a dummy loop to break out of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Produces NO output, because Sort-Object's End block never runs.\r\ndo { \r\n  1..10 | % { if ($_ -gt 2) { break }; $_ } | Sort-Object -Descending\r\n } while ($False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that _without_ the final `Sort-Object -Descending` pipeline stage, you _would_ see output, because the objects are being output in the `%` script block as they're being received.\r\n\r\n  This quiet termination of the entire pipeline is similar to a statement-terminating error that is silenced.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n* Stopping only the _upstream_ cmdlets (the cmdlet calls in _earlier_ pipeline stages), as `Select-Object -First <n>` does, for instance, giving _downstream_ cmdlets a chance to run their `End` blocks.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Produces (2, 1), because Sort-Object's End block IS run.\r\n1..10 | Select-Object -First 2 | Sort-Object -Descending\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis scenario is about _stopping further input_, while still allowing remaining pipeline stages to finish their processing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact that the upstream cmdlets do _not_ also get to run their `End` blocks can be problematic, as that may be required for cleanup tasks: see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7930; PR #9900 would instead introduce a `cleanup` block to ensure cleanup even when stopped via `StopUpstreamCommandsException`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOriginally reported for:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta (v6.0.0-beta.1)\r\n```\r\n",
