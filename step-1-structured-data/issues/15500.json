      "body": "These features are solely reliant on Internet Explorer and thus not cross-platform compatible. The Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet was completely rewritten back in version 6.x for cross-platform compatibility, so it no longer supports those features.\r\n\r\nIf you want to scrape the HTML in a structured matter, you might want to look at using Selenium, which can let you analyse a webpage directly and pull back whatever information you might need.",
