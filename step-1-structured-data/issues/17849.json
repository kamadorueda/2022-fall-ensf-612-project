The versions of these operating systems that were supported have reached their end-of-life dates. We are not supporting any newer versions. We've documented this [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.2)\r\n\r\nThere are many distributions of Linux that are not officially supported by Microsoft. In some cases, PowerShell may be supported by the community for these releases. For more information, see [Community support for PowerShell on Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/community-support?view=powershell-7.2). ",
