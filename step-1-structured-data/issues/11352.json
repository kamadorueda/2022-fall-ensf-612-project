(Response status code does not indicate success: 404 (Not Found).)\r\nUpdate-Help: Failed to update Help for the module(s) 'ConfigDefender, Defender, Microsoft.PowerShell.Operation.Validation, UEV, Whea, WindowsDeveloperLicense' with UI culture(s) {en-US} : A Help URI cannot contain more than 10 redirections. Specify a valid Help URI.\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\System32>\r\n```\r\nAnd, the thing is I have no idea what was successfully updated.\r\n\r\nMy recommendation is to skip the failed updates, save them aside and keep updating the rest. Then list all failed ones at the end.\r\n\r\nThis way the list of all the failed ones can be reported to Github and owners.\r\n:)\r\n\r\n![FailedUpdateHelp_2019-12-16_10-27-46](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19892435/70919394-cc63ee00-1fee-11ea-9818-31b4ba52aa32.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
