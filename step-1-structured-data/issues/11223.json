  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell extension has its own profile paths, but it generates these based on the hosting PowerShell session's profile locations.\r\n\r\nThis is easy to do in script, but significantly harder from C#. There's some back and forth in the PowerShell codebase between SMA and ConHost when it comes to creating these paths, and it looks like we should generalise the API and expose it for general use in PowerShell-targeting .NET libraries.\r\n",

So I'm imagining this to be yet another API to be overridden on `PSHost`. I don't want to get more concrete than that without collecting some more requirements.",
