      "body": "`Start` is a built-in alias for `Start-Process`, and `Start-Process` launches a process _asynchronously_.\r\n\r\nIf  you combine that with `-NoNewWindow` (which is implied on Unix-like platforms) and the launched process is a  console application, its output will appear at random times.\r\n\r\nTo avoid that, use `-Wait` to ensure synchronous invocation, though note that if you simply want synchronous execution of a console application, there's no need to use `Start-Process` at all - just invoke the program _directly_.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't actually use `start` / `Start-Process`, please clarify your invocation scenario.\r\n\r\nGenerally, please remember that this repo is for PowerShell _Core_ issues only.",
