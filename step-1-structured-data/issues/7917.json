  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nFix `BeginInvoke()`/`EndInvoke(IAsyncResult)` to return results when `Stop()` or `BeginStop(callback, state)`/`EndStop(IAsyncResult)` was called previously.\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, `EndInvoke(IAsyncResult)` returns null when it should return a collection of results:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS:1> $ps = [powershell]::Create()\r\nPS:2> $ps.AddScript(\"'Hello'; Sleep 2; 'World'\") > $null\r\nPS:3> $a = $ps.BeginInvoke(); $ps.Stop()\r\nPS:4> $a = $ps.BeginInvoke(); $m = $ps.EndInvoke($a)\r\nPS:5> $m -eq $null\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that `OutputBuffer` is not set to `null` in `Stop` and `BeginStop/EndStop` when the powershell instance owns the `OutputBuffer` object. Since the pipeline has been intentionally stopped by the caller, the `OutputBuffer` should be set to `null` as well when it's owned by the PowerShell instance.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [x] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
