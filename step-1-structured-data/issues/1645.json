  "body": "Due to https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/597, .NET Core's installation instructions of `brew link --force openssl` are now invalid (for good reasons, due to security holes). Until .NET Core updates their libraries to find the OpenSSL libraries correctly, we can update them as part of `Start-PSBootstrap`.\n\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/3964\n\nThis re-enables OS X builds, and patches the necessary libraries. It also disables the Travis CI cache (again) because it's unbearably slow on OS X.\n",
