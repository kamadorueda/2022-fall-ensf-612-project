This also would not necessarily prevent similar usage errors from occurring unless all the parameters for a command are resolved to - parameters.  One area we think this might be considered is with the suggestion framework, however it doesn't resolve the problem of incorrect usage in scripts. Error will still be produced.  The current error produced form `Dir /s` is very explanatory.",
