  "body": "This issue is opened based on the [comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6939#issuecomment-394880053) in PR #6939.\r\n\r\n> Class QueryRunspaces and enum SessionFilterState from ConnectPSSession.cs\r\n>\r\n> QueryRunspaces is only used for session disconnect, which is only supported on Windows. PSRemotingCmdlets.cs is a heavily loaded file to support many remoting cmdlet base classes. Moving QueryRunspaces there just makes it more bloated and confusing in my opinion.\r\nI feel that QueryRunspaces should be put into a separate utils file that can be skipped for Linux.\r\nYou should also #ifdef out its use in the Get-PSSession parameter set since it is not supported on Linux.\r\n\r\nThe type `QueryRunspaces` is only for session connection/disconnection. It's used in `Connect-PSSession`/`Receive-PSSession`/`Get-PSSession` and it's also directly used by the abstract class `PSRunspaceCmdlet` from `PSRemotingCmdlet.cs`. Now `Connect-PSSession` and `Receive-PSSession` are disabled in Unix build, but `QueryRunspaces` is still used in `Get-PSSession` (in `getrunspacecommand.cs`) and `PSRunspaceCmdlet` (in `PSRemotingCmdlet.cs`), even though the connenction/disconnection feature is not available on Unix platforms.\r\n\r\nSo, we need to properly disable all code realted to session connection/disconnection for Unix build, and then, as @PaulHigin suggested in the comment, `QueryRunspaces` and `SessionFilterState` probably should be moved a separate file that can be skipped for Unix build compilation.\r\n",
