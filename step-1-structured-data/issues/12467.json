  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nPS Core suggests recently used commands with arguments and flags when typing (as shown below). This is a great feature but it has one significant problem. In order to accept that suggestion, one must press the right arrow key (default) when the cursor is at the last character. The only key binding for the right arrow key is ForwardChar which is also used when moving the cursor in the terminal. It would be great to have separate binding for complete suggestion action without changing the standard navigation of right-left arrow keys. This new binding should probably allow completing suggestion when the cursor is not at the end of the command.\r\n![pscsuggestions](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36335136/80139780-4ad92980-85a7-11ea-9db9-75b90521759f.png)\r\n\r\n# Expected behaviour\r\nUser is able to bind any key eg. TAB to action responsible for completing command suggestions.  Preferable user can use this action while the cursor is not at the end of the command.\r\n",
