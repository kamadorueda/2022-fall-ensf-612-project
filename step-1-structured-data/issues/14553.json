I went on to test some stuff out and see what would be acceptable in jsonc format to get a better understanding of how Powershell 7 could be interpreting it.\r\n\r\nThis is valid in jsonc:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16005493/104787352-21b78500-5744-11eb-87fe-1e50a31d7ab3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm curious if because ConvertFrom-Json takes a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) formatted string and JSON start with an object with key-value pairs inside it that it takes your array and puts it into a global empty key and everything else becomes a value?
