This is Powershell Core 7.0.1 I think.\r\nI am on Linux Mint 19.3 Tricia x64 MATE. No LMDE or anything fancy. I just want to run powershell because I need to check hashes for a 32-bit Windows Image. `curl` (the linux command, not ps) always messes up.\r\n\r\nAll of the commands are in the attachment below:\r\n[Commands.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/4730884/Commands.txt)\r\nThe not working .deb file:\r\n_Cannot Post!_\r\n\r\n\r\n",
