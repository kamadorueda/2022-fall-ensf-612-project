  "body": "It appears powershell over SSH going to a Windows console is broken strangely. If you use powershell on Windows to ssh and then powershell, you get the last line repeated everytime you press a character. If you use `cmd`, it basically keeps writing a single line in place rather than ever moving.\r\n\r\nAny other linux tool, nano, vim, etc over SSH work fine. So not sure what powershell is doing in particular that the windows powershell terminal cannot handle while handling more complex terminal abusing applications.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nSetup for example the \"OpenSSH for Windows\" or a msys2 ssh implementation (it doesn't matter which one).\r\n\r\nLaunch powershell on Windows. Execute the ssh client to a debian 8 machine which has powershell installed via the deb packages.\r\n\r\nExecute powershell.\r\n\r\nTry typing.\r\n\r\nIt ends up broken like this:\r\n\r\nPS /home/mroszko> PS /home/mroszko> $\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $P\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PS\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSV\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVE\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVER\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERS\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERSI\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERSIO\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERSION\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERSIONT\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERSIONTA\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERSIONTAB\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERSIONTABL\r\n                  PS /home/mroszko> $PSVERSIONTABLE\r\n\r\nWhen I was simply trying to type $PSVERSIONTABLE, it automatically kept regenerating the line.\r\nOther strange artifacts can occur instead too, cursor not moving, lines jumping, buffer bleeding.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n`\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-beta\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\r\nCLRVersion\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-beta.2\r\nOS                             Linux 3.16.0-4-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 3.16.39-1 (2016-12-30)\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat I've tried:\r\n\r\nCmder/Conemu which wrap Cmd.exe and PowerShell.exe\r\n\r\nPowershell.exe standalone with OpenSSH for Windows and msys2 ssh separately\r\nCmd.exe standalone with OpenSSH for Windows and msys2 ssh separately\r\n\r\n",
