I don't want to have to quote every time I use a dot, and I'd rather not have to specify --% for every command.\r\n\r\nIs it reasonable to expect a setting in pwsh.runtimeconfig.json to disable parsing of command arguments? Call it dumb mode or whatever.\r\n\r\nI see other people are also doing strange things to work around this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18923315/using-in-powershell\r\n",
