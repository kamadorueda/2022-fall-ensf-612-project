If you start a powershell 5 terminal **powershell.exe** and then from within that run **pwsh.exe** and then start python (2.7) and then press **ctrl-c** the terminal doesn't exit but the keyboard input is totally messed up. Sometimes it doesn't even register a keypress or moves the cursor somewhere else in the terminal. ",
