  "body": "Steps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n* Open powershell in any folder\r\n* Write to powershell \"code .\" //open the folder with visual studio code\r\n* Click to powershell window close button one time. Window will not close. \r\n* Click a second time, windows will close.\r\n\r\nI think it should close when I first click. This problem is just \"code . \" Occurs when I run the command.\r\nI guess when powershell is unfocus when it opens another window it can't detect the first shutdown.",
