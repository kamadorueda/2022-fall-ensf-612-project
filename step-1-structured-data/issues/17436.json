      "body": "Yep. The method signature for `Invoke()` is [`Collection<PSObject>`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.scriptblock.invoke?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0). It always collects all the pipeline output into a collection, regardless of what the output was or how many items were output.\r\n\r\nThus, when you call `Count` on the resulting collection you get `1`, because there is one item in the collection.\r\n\r\nCompare to [InvokeReturnAsIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.scriptblock.invokereturnasis?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0) which returns simply `object`, which may be a collection or a single item, or even null, depending on what the output of the scriptblock actually is.",

      "body": "Yep! That's normal behaviour for PowerShell as well. Anything that is output to the pipeline (even in a scriptblock, the pipeline is still processing the output) is enumerated, but only if it satisfies PowerShell's specific check for \"enumerable\" items. This generally includes pretty much anything that implements the IList interface, but notably never includes things that implement IDictionary.\r\n\r\nThe fact that IDictionary items are enumerated when displayed at the console is actually an additional enumeration applied specifically in the formatter, added for a bit of usability as there isn't really a sensible way to display a \"whole dictionary\" without enumerating the contents.\r\n\r\nYou can check which things PS considers \"enumerable\" for its pipeline I believe by passing the object to `[System.Management.Automation.LanguagePrimitives]::IsObjectEnumerable($item)`",
