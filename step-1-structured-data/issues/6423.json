  "body": "I'm wondering if it's possible to predicate stream redirection on some user-defined logic without resorting to building a command line using strings.  Here is a mock up of what I am trying to achieve:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfunction f {\r\n    Write-Error 'f'\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction g {\r\n    param([switch]$SuppressErrorStream)\r\n    # ... imagine some elaborate logic deciding about stream \r\n    # redirection is here ...\r\n\r\n    # How can I predicate the redirection of the error stream on,\r\n    # for example, $SuppressErrorStream?\r\n\r\n    f 2>$null\r\n}\r\n\r\ng                      # this should leave the error stream unredirected\r\ng -SuppressErrorStream # this should redirect the error stream to null\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I don't want to prevent writes to the error stream (so `$ErrorActionPreference` isn't suitable), rather I want to programmatically control the output of the error stream.  These are two different concepts by design per #4572.\r\n\r\nThe analog for arguments that I use is `@splat`.  Is there something similar to splatting for the stream redirection operators?",

I see that now. \r\n\r\n>Perhaps you could use scriptblocks...\r\n\r\nThat seems like the best option.  Thanks for your help @BrucePay!",
