  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nhelp about_profile\r\n```\r\n`q` to exit.\r\n\r\nThen immediately do it again.\r\n```powershell\r\nhelp about_profile\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nOn 5.1, the first `q` exits the screen at the bottom. The text of the help is still on-screen, but the cursor and the input line are on the last line of the screen.\r\nThe second `help` (and anything else you might do) displays normally, scrolling or clearing the screen contents before displaying.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nOn pwsh, the first `q` exits the screen at the top. The text of the help is still on-screen, but the cursor and the input line are the first line of the screen. This means that the output of anything else you do going forward gets mixed in with the help text that is left on-screen.\r\n\r\nThe second `help` doesn't clear the screen before it paints the text, resulting in garbled text. Here are a few lines from the top of the screen after the second `help`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT PROFILES\r\n    Searching Help for about_profile ...\r\n    [                                                                                                                        ]\r\nSHORT DESCRIPTION\r\nDescribes how to create and use a PowerShell profile.\r\nDescribes how to create and use a PowerShell profile.\r\n\r\nLONG DESCRIPTION\r\nLONG DESCRIPTION\r\nYou can create a PowerShell profile to customize your environment and to\r\nYou can create a PowerShell profile to customize your environment and to.\r\nadd session-specific elements to every PowerShell session that you start.\r\nA PowerShell profile is a script that runs when PowerShell starts.

Both environments were started fresh, and I did not load any modules, etc. The \"help about_profile\" were the first commands I issued in both sessions.\r\n\r\nBoth consoles are 132x50, using Consolas 14pt.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

What is in the about*.help.txt file(s) should be already rendered text (and is, on every other about I\u2019ve looked at, including at least one other one with a table, i.e. about_special_characters. The problem is with the about_profile.help.txt file; the text isn\u2019t properly rendered in that file.\n\nI created an issue in Powershell-Docs for this.\n\n(On a different note, I tried cut-and-pasting (with Ctrl-V) your below line into the pwsh session, and it doesn\u2019t work. And it turns out ctrl-V doesn\u2019t work from anywhere. \"Enable ctrl key shortcuts\" is checked on the shortcut/session. Works fine in 5.1.)\n\n> On Mar 27, 2018, at 8:25 PM, Steve Lee <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n> \n> Seems to happen due to setting $outputencoding = [System.Console]::OutputEncoding.
