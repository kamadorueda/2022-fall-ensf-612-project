On the surface it looks like += is simply ignoring values from higher scopes and only looking at the local scope.\r\n\r\nYeah, all assignments do that afaik. You can read from previous scopes without issue, but attempting to write to them will create a new `PSVariable` in the current scope.\r\n\r\nYou can still write to previous scopes, but you would need to use `Set-Variable` with the `Scope` parameter, or be explicit in your intent with a scope modifier prefix like `$global:myGlobalVar += 10`.\r\n\r\nThat said, this is a little strange:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$x = 10\r\n& { $x += 1; $x }\r\n# returns 1 - not expected.  I would have expected 11 here.\r\n$x\r\n# returns 10 - expected.  Child scope shouldn't default to altering parent scope.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would *not* expect that an add assignment would alter the variable from the parent scope, but I *would* expect that it would use the parents value for initialization.\r\n\r\n**Edit:** I'm realizing the strange part I'm describing is literally what the OP is referring to, oops.  Yeah looks like a bug imo.  It *is* possible that it is by design though, someone else would have to confirm.",

It's not finding it at all, and adding the value you asked to a nonexistent value, which to PS is treated the same as if the value was `0`. You can see this more clearly with @SeeminglyScience's example -- the value it uses is not the original value of `$x`, it's just adding the specified value from `+=` to an empty variable.\r\n\r\nThanks for the clarification @SeeminglyScience! Yeah, I agree it _could_ be by design, but given that all other variable accesses tends to pull from the parent scope I think the inconsistency should probably be fixed.\r\n\r\n@daxian-dbw, this might be something y'all wanna take a look at and sort out if we should be looking to fix. \ud83d\ude0a ",
