Here's a mockup of the suggested output.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPath      : D:\\Temp\\trans.txt\r\nStarted   : 6/14/2021 2:33:50 PM\r\nRuntime   : 00:34:21.8291729\r\nAuthor    : company\\jeff\r\nProcessID : 29076\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt a prompt, I could run this to make sure no transcript is currently running that I'm not aware of, that might capture sensitive information. Or I could use this in a script to take other action. I'd also like to see an option with `Stop-Transcript` to kill a transcript based on a file path. But that may require a separate issue.",
