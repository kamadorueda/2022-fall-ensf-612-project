  "body": "For those of you who frequently work with the ActiveDirectory module, you'll know using `Get-ADUser` or `Get-ADComputer` will only return a few of the many properties of the object from the database (10 and 9 respectively). If you wish to retrieve additional properties of an AD object, you must specify the `-Properties` parameter and provide one or more property names.\r\n\r\nWhen passing an ADObject that contains one or more non-default properties to a runspace as an argument, the property values are not accessible. They can not be accessed with dot-notation, nor used in a Where-Object filter (among other things).\r\n\r\nInterestingly enough, if you just pass the object through the runspace script and output it again in the current context, it will now have the missing properties again, as if they were never lost.\r\n\r\nI can reproduce the exact same behavior with `Start-ThreadJob`, `ForEach-Object -Parallel` (which of which uses runspaces) as well as the popular 3rd party module `PoshRSJob`. When using either of these method, it makes no difference to which method I use to pass the object into the job. The problem occurs if I use the `-ArgumentList` or the `$using:` syntax.\r\n\r\nThis problem however does **NOT** occur with the standard `Start-Job` which spawns an entire new process rather than a new thread/runspace. The downside to using standard background jobs is that the objects are serialized upon passing to the job.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nIn the example below the `Name` property of an ADUser object is \"default\", but the `City` property must be requested specifically. I output the two properties three times each. Once before, once from within the runspace, and once using the object that was passed through the runspace and back into the current context.\r\n```powershell\r\n$ADUser = Get-ADUser -identity mander -Properties City\r\n\r\nWrite-Output \"Before Runspace - The value of name is: $($ADUser.Name)\"\r\nWrite-Output \"Before Runspace - The value of city is: $($ADUser.City)\"\r\n\r\n$Runspace = [runspacefactory]::CreateRunspace()\r\n$PowerShell = [powershell]::Create()\r\n$PowerShell.runspace = $Runspace\r\n$Runspace.Open()\r\n\r\n[void]$PowerShell.AddScript({\r\n    Param ($ADUser)\r\n    $a = \"Inside Runspace - The value of name is: $($ADUser.Name)\"\r\n    $b = \"Inside Runspace - The value of city is: $($ADUser.City)\"\r\n    $c = $ADUser\r\n\r\n    return @($a,$b,$c)\r\n})\r\n[void]$PowerShell.AddArgument($ADUser)\r\n\r\n$a, $b, $c = $PowerShell.Invoke()\r\n\r\n$a\r\n$b\r\n\r\nWrite-Output \"After Runspace  - The value of name is: $($c.Name)\"\r\nWrite-Output \"After Runspace  - The value of city is: $($c.City)\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nBefore Runspace - The value of name is: Max Anderson\r\nBefore Runspace - The value of city is: Atlanta\r\nInside Runspace - The value of name is: Max Anderson\r\nInside Runspace - The value of city is: Atlanta\r\nAfter Runspace  - The value of name is: Max Anderson\r\nAfter Runspace  - The value of city is: Atlanta\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nBefore Runspace - The value of name is: Max Anderson\r\nBefore Runspace - The value of city is: Atlanta\r\nInside Runspace - The value of name is: Max Anderson\r\nInside Runspace - The value of city is:\r\nAfter Runspace  - The value of name is: Max Anderson\r\nAfter Runspace  - The value of city is: Atlanta\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

What's even more interesting is that the property itself still exists when checking `$obj.PSObject.Properties` and it has the value\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$ps = [PowerShell]::Create()\r\n\r\n$null = $ps.AddScript(@'\r\nGet-ADUser -Identity vagrant-domain -Property City\r\n'@)\r\n\r\n$user = $ps.Invoke()\r\n\r\n\"Direct: '$($user[0].City)'\"\r\n\"By Prop: '$(($user[0].PSObject.Properties | Where-Object Name -eq City).Value)'\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nDirect: ''\r\nBy Prop: 'My City'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe same thing applies when running it other ways like through `Invoke-Command` but interestingly not `ForEach-Object -Parallel` even though no serialization occurs through that method. I believe remote runspaces are fine because when the ADUser object is serialized the type isn't preserved so the object that is returned is just a generic property bag.\r\n\r\nI'm honestly not sure why this is happening so interested to hear what others may have to say.",
