  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nStart with no file 'test.txt' present.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\"hello!\" | out-file -append test.txt # text pattern is important, even number of bytes!\r\nmore test.txt\r\n```\r\nThe above command in Windows PowerShell 5.1, generates test.txt apparently in UTF-16 LE.\r\n\r\nThen repeating the command in PowerShell Core 6.1 causes it to append the text to the end of the now existing file in UTF-8.\r\n\r\nNow repeating the command in Windows PowerShell 5.1 causes it to append the text again as UTF-16.\r\n\r\nDelete the file and reverse the order, and the results are simply reversed.\r\n\r\nSame behavior if 6.2 PR3 is used.  This could be a result of #707.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe documentation states that the default encoding is UTF-16, for both 5.1 and 6, there is not a separate selection for 6.1 in the docs.\r\n\r\nI ran a script I had written and been running in 5.1, on 6.1, and it uses the `out-file -append` command to write to a log, and the most recent log entry failed to be readable afterwards.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nWindows 10 1809.",
