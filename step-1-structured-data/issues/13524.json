  "body": "`-Include` and `-Exclude` operate on the leaf path components of the _input_ path (pattern) only, even with `Get-ChildItem` (except if `-Recurse` is also specified) - while that is counterintuitive in and of itself, it has always worked this way (see #3304 and #8459).\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, however, `-Include` seems to match _files_ only with `Get-ChildItem` (unlike with `Get-Item`), so combining \r\n`-Directory` with `-Include` yields no output (except with `*` as the pattern):\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Windows, macOS, Linux all have top-level u* folders\r\n# The test would succeed with Get-Item (which requires removing -Directory)\r\nGet-ChildItem /* -Include u* -Directory | Should -Not -BeNull\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should pass.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails due to lack of output:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected a value, but got $null or empty.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.6\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Or is the inconsistency that is at question? I also wonder if this is an odd Windows thing when in the root of C.

      "body": "@jdhitsolutions, the value of `-Include` is twofold:\r\n\r\n* It supports _PowerShell_'s wildcard language (as (implied) `-Path` does in your example, but I'm contrasting it with the less powerful, legacy-quirks-addled patterns supported by `-Filter`).\r\n\r\n* It supports specifying _multiple_ patterns, given that the parameter is `[String[]]`-typed. without having to repeat the parent path.\r\n\r\nOn a more philosophical note: That there may be better solutions in a given situation is no reason not to fix broken behavior.\r\n\r\nIn case you're wondering if such questions arise in the real world: https://stackoverflow.com/q/63590402/45375",
