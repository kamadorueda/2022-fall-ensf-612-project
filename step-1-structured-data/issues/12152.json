You should consider migrating to PowerShell Core and .Net Core.\r\n",

I think this is lost on Microsoft/PowerShell community (but what is new there... \"the Devs are the darlings\")  but a) we are not developers, hence learning yet another net new tool (Visual Studio) is not somethign that is going to happen and b) has a HUGE licensing impact (ISE was included, previously)... \r\n\r\nNow I have to go get a VS license just to run Powershell in the future?\r\n\r\nNOT OK, at all... i.e, someone needs to develop an ISE specifically for PowerShell Core/7",
