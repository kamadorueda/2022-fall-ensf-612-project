  "body": "# Steps to reproduce (this is not specific to the package management module and appears to apply  widely. \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Module -ListAvailable PackageManagement | select -expand path\r\n\r\nImport-module packageManagement \r\n\r\n(get-module PackageManagement).path\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThe two get-module commands should output the same path.  \r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nWhen the module is loaded, the path returned appears to become the path the root module listed in the manifest. \r\nSo in this example it returns PackageManagement.psM1 not \\PackageManagement.psD1\r\n\r\nHowever if this path is used to load a module in a new or later session loading the psM file won't load all the components needed for successful use of the module. (e.g. format files, type files, assembly files) - in this case loading the PSM1 result in 22 fewer items returned by get-formatData\r\n\r\nThis primarily affects testing scenarios . \r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\nNote this does not appear to be a new issue, it seems to happen in all versions of PowerShell.
