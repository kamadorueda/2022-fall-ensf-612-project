  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSince introducing the temp: drive, it would be nice to be able to use it with native commands.  If you do:\r\n\r\nOn Linux/macOS:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nls temp:\r\n```\r\n\r\nor on Windows:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ncmd /c dir temp:\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of them don't know what temp: maps to as it's purely a powershell construct.  However, the native command processor could determine that the string is a valid PSPath mapped to FileSystemProvider and replace it with the resolved file system path so it works as most users would expect.\r\n\r\nFor the minority of users that want to pass something that matches the PSPath but don't want it resolved, they can always put it in quotes to make it literal.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nUpdate NativeCommandProcessor to detect PSPaths that map to filesystemprovider and replace the argument with the resolved file system path.\r\n",
