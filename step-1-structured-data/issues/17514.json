However, even though it is a distinct operator with its own name, it still _accesses a member_, namely the parameterized `Item` property that `[]` is syntactic sugar for.\r\n\r\n* However, given that dictionaries can be accessed with either operator (e.g. `@{ foo = 1 }['foo']` or `@{ foo = 1 }.foo`, the non-support for `[]` on collections  makes for an awkward asymmetry:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Index notation with key:\r\n(@{ foo = 1 }, @{ foo = 2 })['foo']  # !! NO OUTPUT\r\n\r\n# Dot notation (property access):\r\n(@{ foo = 1 }, @{ foo = 2 }).foo     # OK -> 1, 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth commands should produce the same output.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe first command (index notation with key) produces no output.\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v7.3.0-preview.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "\r\nI think this is a quirk of how the member and index operations work\r\n`@(@{1=\"One\"},@{1=\"Uno\"})[1]` \r\n\r\nApplies the index to the array.    And `.1` doesn't work at all (it's not a valid member name)\r\n\r\nSo in your example `(@{ foo = 1 }, @{ foo = 2 })[1]` is the first item of the array.  \r\n\r\n`@(1,2,3)[\"Hello\"]`  Doesn't throw an error even through a string isn't valid as an array index.   And we can apply indexes to things which don't actually have them `$pid[0]`  is the same as `$pid` and `$pid[1]` or `$pid[\"hello\"]` don't throw errors.   \r\n`$Array.Something` acts as `foreach ($item in array) {$item.something}` and this is relied on in more places than we can count (especially where code assumes it is dealing with one object but is actually dealing with a single-member array,  note that with `$pid[0]`.  `$pid.count`, `foreach ($p in $Pid)`  etc we can make the opposite assumption ). \r\n\r\nIs there a need for a special behaviour in the index operator when the supplied index for an array is not an number?  Certainly there are cases like displaying a list of files and doing \"$f = Read-Host \"Enter the Number(s) of the files you want\" and then getting `$files[$f]`  where we would not want the user typing `Name` to get all the file names .  If pushed I could argue the case for not allowing index to do anything different, I just wonder if there is a stronger counter-argument? \r\n\r\n\r\n",

See #17520.\r\n\r\n(That something like `@{1a=\"One\"}` doesn't work as a hashtable literal unless the key is quoted, and that `@{'1a'=\"One\"}.1a` doesn't work as a property access are separate problems: #15925 and #14036).\r\n\r\nRe `[1]`: Note that we needn't consider _positional_ indexing in this discussion, because in member-access enumeration positional indexing is always applied to the _collection itself_, given that type-native members take precedence over looking for members on the elements of the collection.\r\n\r\nNote that, strictly speaking, `IDictionary` entries aren't _members_ (properties), but as a _syntactic convenience_ PowerShell _usually_ allows you to treat them as such, with dot notation being supported interchangeably with _key_-based indexing (with subtle differences around key types).\r\n\r\n * Afterthought: however, `[]`, the index operator still _accesses a member_, namely the parameterized `Item` property that `[]` is syntactic sugar for.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the inconsistency of this interchangeable use only applying to _scalars_ in the case of key-based indexing that this issue is about.\r\n\r\nI don't feel strongly about this, and given that I only stumbled upon it recently, it suggests that not too many users run into it.\r\nWhether or not a change is made, I'd say that a note in [about_Member-Access_Enumeration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_Member-Access_Enumeration) is called for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Inexplicably fails (returns empty collection).\r\n#    It does work with [ordered], however.\r\n#    The equivalent .ForEach({ $_.Item('foo') }) works with either type.\r\n(@{ foo = 1 }, @{ foo = 2 }).ForEach('Item', 'foo')\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee #17649\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
