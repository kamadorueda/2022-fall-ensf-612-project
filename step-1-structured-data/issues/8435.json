  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a PowerShell developer, I want to be able to obtain the path of an item relative to a path that is not my current directory so that I can avoid changing my current location context for a relative directory lookup. \r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nAssuming I have a directory like this:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n/MyProject\r\n    |-/dir\r\n        |-test_1.txt\r\n        |-test_2.txt\r\n        |-/subdir\r\n            |-test_3.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently, if I want to do a resolve a path relative to a *different* directory, I have to use set-location before calling `Resolve-Path`. For example, if I wanted to get all my `.txt` file locations *relative to `dir`*, I would have to do something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n/MyProject> cd dir\r\n/MyProject/dir> Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Include \"*.txt\" | Resolve-Path -Relative\r\n./subdir/test_3.txt\r\n./test_1.txt\r\n./test_2.txt\r\n/MyProject/dir> cd ..\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n/MyProject> Get-ChildItem .\\dir -Recurse -Include \"*.txt\" | Resolve-Path -Relative -ReferencePath .\\dir\r\n./subdir/test_3.txt\r\n./test_1.txt\r\n./test_2.txt\r\n```",

      "body": "@rkeithhill  I don't think that'll work for this particular problem. It appears that the `-Resolve` switch on `Join-Path` is only for checking whether the resulting joined path actually exists. At least on the surface, it doesn't appear to help with relative resolution. From the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/join-path?view=powershell-6):\r\n\r\n```none\r\n-Resolve\r\nIndicates that this cmdlet should attempt to resolve the joined path from the current provider.\r\n\r\n* If wildcards are used, the cmdlet returns all paths that match the joined path.\r\n* If no wildcards are used, the cmdlet will error if the path does not exist.\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
