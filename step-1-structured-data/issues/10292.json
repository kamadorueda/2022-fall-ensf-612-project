  "body": "Note: The fact that `Get-ChildItem` and `Get-Item` do not find hidden items with _literal_ paths even without `-Force` - in contrast with other filesystem cmdlets such as `Test-Path` and `Resolve-Path`, see #6502 and #6501 - is problematic in itself, but that's the behavior we're stuck with.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about a particular inconsistency in the context of the current behavior.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn Linux or macOS (does not happen on Windows).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nmkdir -p .tf  # create temporary hidden folder\r\n{ Get-Item .tf -EA Stop } | Should -Throw\r\n{ Get-Item .tf/ -EA Stop } | Should -Throw\r\nrmdir .tf\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that Get*Child*-Item, by contrast, consistently finds hidden directories by _literal_ path even without `-Force`, with or without a trailing `/` - arguably, another inconsistency.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo output, because both tests should pass, given that hidden dir. `.tf` shouldn't be found without `-Force`, with or without trailing `/`.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected an exception, to be thrown, but no exception was thrown.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, the second command targeting `.tf` with a trailing `/` unexpectedly succeeded (found the item).\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core v7.0.0-preview.2 (7.0.0-preview.2) on macOS 10.14.6\r\nPowerShell Core v7.0.0-preview.2 (7.0.0-preview.2) on Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS\r\n```\r\n",
