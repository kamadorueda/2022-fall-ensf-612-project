  "body": "Back in the beginning of time there was an issue dealing with the way powershell handles (executable) script files, most often seen in anything made in a native *nix environment. The idea is to be able to run hashbanged scripts from pwsh. \r\n\r\nQ: What is a hashbanged script?  \r\nA: Pretty much any script starting with something like:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\r\n# mypyscript -- This is any random python coded script executable from command line\r\nprint('Don't let hashbang issues disappear like teardrops in the sea!')\r\n...\r\n```\r\n<sub>Yes, so you noticed this hashbang is not for windows. Well, yes a no. It is correct for WSL, but powershell doesn't understand it for the obvious reason, it is *supposed to be path*. However, if Windows powershell would like to maintain any compatibility with any future script handling, pwsh developers need to rethink this \"path\": `/usr/bin/env` and handle it as a virtual path like any of the other [special windows paths](https://ss64.com/nt/syntax-variables.html).</sub> \r\n\r\nTwo things for sure.  \r\n1. It should not, under any circumstances, change what's in the original code. \r\n2. Windows/Powershll dev's should not start putting their own Windows paths there. \r\n(Instead consider removing the path altogether, by using just the interpreter's name, like `#!python3`, but maintaining full compatibility with the 20+ year `/usr/bin/env` and `/bin/<interpreter>` formats. \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n./mypyscript\r\n\r\n# doesn't work\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n./mypyscript\r\n\r\nDon't let hashbang issues disappear like teardrops in the sea!\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should be able to dot-execute any scripted code from powershell command line, when that code contain the correct hashbang for the scripting engine. (Eg. `.ps1 .py .go .js etc.`) \r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n* Doesn't work:   \r\nOpens a window dialog, asking what you want to use to open this file.\r\n\r\n* A secondary issue, is that:  \r\nsome installers actually modify the original code's first hashbang line.  \r\n**This should never be allowed to happen!**\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA longer and far more technical and detailed discussion of this, was made in this issue:\r\n* https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9430\r\n\r\nBut it's title is perhaps not ideal, to make it a very relevant issue, although it is the essence. \r\n(Issue pertains to handling of **`.`** (dot) in the `$env:PATHEXT`. )\r\n\r\nFurthermore there was an honest attempt by @mklement0 to provide a CMD-based work-around\r\n as discussed in this SO question: \r\n\r\n* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55601446/how-to-run-a-python-program-from-powershell-based-on-python-hashbang\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "IIRC [shebangs/hashbangs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) are really handled in the kernel and not the shell and the Win32 subsystem on the NT kernel doesn't have a concept of shebangs. For non-executable files, Windows really uses the extension of the file to determine what program to use to open the file itself so when you do `./mypyscript` with a shebang of `#!/usr/bin/env python3` Windows has no idea what to do with it. Even trying to add support for interpreting Unix shebangs will be fraught with danger and IMO too magical, using `#!/usr/bin/env python3` as an example:\r\n\r\n* On Windows Python is just installed with `python.exe` so there will be no `python3.exe` in the `PATH`\r\n* Even if there was, what Python 3 interpreter will be used if there are multiple present\r\n* If it was also just `#!/usr/bin/python3` then it's the same issue, probably even more so because it's a hardcoded path and on Unix it won't rely on the `PATH`\r\n\r\nPersonally I think this would require too much magic and maintenance to achieve.",

Are you proposing to handle *files* with a new extension like, `myscript.psx` or are you proposing a hashbang, like `#!/usr/bin/enx psx`?\r\n\r\nI think maybe you're proposing the former, but regardless, from a portability perspective, I disagree with both. The whole point here, being that we should be able to execute any script (regardless platform) using the dot method. \r\n\r\n> On Unix-like platforms, for security reasons, the executable bit would have to be set too.\r\n\r\nYes, that is also needed, but I have no Widows experience for this, as all my Windows machines are completely permission free. The very first thing I do on **any** vanilla Windows machine is to turn off UAC, and enable Admin on all my shells by default. As a non-corporate sysop, I just find my life unbearable having those (sorry, but rather useless) productivity blocking features on. So until the day that the incomprehensible windows group/file/execute policy/permissions become a one-click operation, that is how I will continue to operate. And in those few cases I have ran into file ownership trouble, Cygwin has come to the rescue and been my best friend for the last 20 years!  \r\n\r\n-- So yes, latest development Windows 10 version, always has Cygwin installed! (And no, WSL with all it's bloated VM features and gigabyte installs, will never replace the lightness of Cygwin.)\r\n\r\n> If this sounds interesting to you, I encourage you to open a new feature request and flesh this idea out (though I can't guarantee that others may find it interesting / unproblematic).\r\n\r\nI think the hacks presented in the linked SO post will have to do for now.

Still, overall it makes sense to me to also defer to `$env:PATH`.\r\n\r\n* All others paths I still recommend _not_ be supported, because there's no sensible _guessing_ as to the intent, and with something like `/bin/sh` - signaling the intent to use the platform's _default shell_ - there is no analog on Windows, and executing an arbitrary `sh.exe` somewhere in the path could be considered a security risk.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo flesh out the need for an _opt-in_: Without it, at least hypothetically, things may start executing that didn't execute before:\r\n\r\n* If you have a currently dormant extension-less shebang script somewhere in `$env:PATH`, calling it by file name only will start executing it - even if an `*.exe` file or file with any other extension listed in `$env:PATHEXT` with the same base name is also present.\r\n\r\n  * Note: if there _isn't_ a true executable with the same base name also present in the same directory, you already do get execution of sorts: such a file is unexpectedly opened _as a document_, which I consider a bug that should be addressed separately - see #12632.\r\n\r\n* Similarly, if both a shebang script `foo` and `foo.ps1` are present in the current directory, `./foo` will then start executing `foo`, given that its file name is an exact match (this is how it already works on Unix).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
