  "body": "https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3815#discussion_r119167392\r\n\r\nOn Nano, two apis are not available which prevents usage, for example, of ctrl+] as a valid key chord to bind to a PSReadline handler.  PSReadline, by default, binds this key combination to go to matching brace.  When connected directly to a Nano container (not via PSRP), it will show:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCtrl+Oem6             GotoBrace               Go to matching brace\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is not useful to the end user.  It seems the right thing to do may be to not bind this (as well as two other chords dependent on `]`) by default if those APIs are not avaialble.",
