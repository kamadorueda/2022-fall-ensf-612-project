Port the existing implicit remoting tests and refactor them massively to make them work in our CI system.\n\n/cc @SteveL-MSFT \n\n2 issues related to `Register-PSSessionConfiguration` were found when fixing the test failures. #2555 and #2556 were opened to track them.\nAll implicit remoting tests are skipped on Linux for now because we cannot create loop back remote session on Linux CI system yet.\n",
