Bugs are no longer being fixed in System.Data.SqlClient, only in Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.\r\n\r\nCase in point: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/16567 was fixed (https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/1411) in Microsoft.Data.SqlClient, but this doesn't help PowerShell 7.2 users since it contains System.Data.SqlClient which will not be fixed.\r\n\r\nAdding Microsoft.Data.SqlClient and its dependencies to PowerShell will still require people to update their affected scripts, but that is much easier than trying to use it as a standalone package (because https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6724).\r\n",

      "body": "Quoted from [Introducing the new Microsoft.Data.SqlClient](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/introducing-the-new-microsoftdatasqlclient/)\r\n\r\n> It means the development focus has changed. We have no intention of dropping support for System.Data.SqlClient any time soon. It will remain as-is and we will fix important bugs and security issues as they arise. If you have a typical application that doesn\u2019t use any of the newest SQL features, then you will still be well served by a stable and reliable System.Data.SqlClient for many years.\r\n\r\nThat means the `System.Data.SqlClient` will still be patched with security fixes, though not all bug fixes. So I guess it's fine to keep it in PowerShell, and add the new `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient`. Thoughts? @TravisEz13 @adityapatwardhan @PaulHigin",
