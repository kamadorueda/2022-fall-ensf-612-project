It \"connects\", I see the progress bar and it just sits there. I can hit the Azure function endpoint and watch the byte count increase in the progress bar.\r\n\r\nHaving these cmdlets emit the results before reading the entire response stream would be useful.",

      "body": "I think this functionality would better fit being an entirely separate cmdlet. The way irm and iwr are now they are basically after-the-fact stream processor/modifiers. They pretty much rely on a completed stream to do anything meaningful. They could probably be modified to work this way, but I feel that functionality breaks with what is expected of these cmdlets.\r\n\r\nIs see this working well with a separate web cmdlets that can grow with more continuous streaming based features (maximum line count, maximum bytes, retrungin a stream object, etc). This kind of functionality would have its own set of parameters that would clutter the other cmdlets for functionality that doesn't really make sense in their normal context. ",
