But, the first thing I'm reading reflect Windows PowerShell which will \"continue\" to cause GREAT Confusion.\r\n\r\nAlso, looking further deep on the Documentation navigation, talks more about Windows PowerShell features: \r\n1. Get-WMIObject - which (I think) is not use in PowerShell Core.\r\n2. Web Access for PowerShell - This is a Windows PowerShell feature. Please unless I'm wrong!\r\n3. Windows PowerShell ISE  - In this case, should it be replace  to VS Code Editor??\r\n\r\nThis is just a few items. I'm hoping when the GA becomes available the documentation could be corrected.\r\n\r\nThanks and Great Work!!\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0-rc> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-rc\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-rc\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17040\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0-rc>\r\n```\r\n",
