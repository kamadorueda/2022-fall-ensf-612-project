That means that, to select a random number between 1 and 100, we must set \u2013maximum to 101; if we set \u2013maximum to 100 then we\u2019d actually select a random number between 1 and 99.\n> By contrast, -minimum is always set to the actual low end of the range.\n\nFrom [here](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff730929.aspx).\n",
