      "body": "Thanks, @iSazonov - does that mean that the automated process suggested in the OP already _is_ in place, and was overridden manually in this case, due to the issue you mention?\r\n\r\nSince preview 4 wasn't removed as a whole, and since the update notification appeared on session startup, I presume https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/tools/metadata.json could have pointed to preview 4 in the meantime, which would enable installation via https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1, given that this installation method isn't affected, right?\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote></blockquote>\n<blockquote></blockquote>",
