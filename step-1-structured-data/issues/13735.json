  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nPS C:\\> enter-pssession -computername localhost -configurationname PowerShell.7.1.0-rc.1\r\n\r\n[localhost]: PS C:\\> invoke-webrequest http://www.google.com\r\n\r\nError: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Net.Connections, Version=5.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI'd expect invoke-webrequest to return the contents of the web page.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nInstead, I receive:\r\n\r\nError: Could not load file or assembly 'System.Net.Connections, Version=5.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b03f5f7f11d50a3a'. The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\nThe problem only occurs when running in a remote session. That's why I ran enter-pssession localhost prior to executing the invoke-webrequest command.\r\n\r\nThe issue began when PowerShell.7.1.0-rc.1 was installed. It's not an issue in the prior version (7.1.0-preview.7).\r\n\r\nInstalling .NET 5.0 RC1 doesn't resolve the issue.\r\n",
