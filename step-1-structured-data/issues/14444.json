  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to use `Out-String` in a manner that doesn't _append a trailing newline_, which is what it currently does and has always done.\r\n\r\nNote that `-NoNewLine` is _not_ a solution, because it suppresses _all_ newlines, so that _two or more_ output lines are then simply directly concatenated (like `-join ''`; e.g. `1, 2 | Out-String -NoNewLine` yields `12`).\r\n\r\nHere's a demonstration of the problem:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# CURRENT behavior:\r\nPS> ('foo' | Out-String) -replace '\\r?\\n', '<newline>'\r\nfoo<newline>   #  A newline was appended.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI see two options:\r\n\r\n* (a) Consider a breaking change - assuming it is justified to consider it a [Bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area) change - and make `Out-String` _never_ append a trailing newline.\r\n\r\n* (b) Introduce a new switch, `-NoTrailingNewLine` (related: #5108)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
