  "body": "Please take a closer look at the default colors used for the powershell terminal on macOS. It's an unreadable mess, particularly in dark mode.\r\n\r\nIdeally, the powershell terminal window should use as many of the user's terminal defaults as possible, and where that's not feasible/practical, look at the current default mode, dark mode or not, and make sure the default colors are as high contrast with the background color as possible.",
