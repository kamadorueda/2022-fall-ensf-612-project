If so, this is a terminating error.\r\n\r\n> Is the error condition related to a specific input object or a subset of input objects? If so, this is a nonterminating error.\r\n\r\n> Does the cmdlet accept multiple input objects, such that processing may succeed on another input object? If so, this is a nonterminating error.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the error at hand should _not_ be a terminating error, given that `Get-ItemPropertyValue` accepts _multiple_ paths via the pipeline.\r\n\r\nAn aside re your workaround:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nGet-ItemProperty -Path $KeyPath | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $KeyName\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nis sufficient - also including `[-Property] $KeyName` is not just unnecessary, it actually _decorates_ the output object with an ETS property of that name.\r\n\r\nDepending on your strict-mode settings, even `(Get-ItemProperty -Path $KeyPath).$KeyName` may do.\r\n\r\n",
