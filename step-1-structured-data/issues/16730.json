      "body": "This is because `ls` itself knows when it is being redirected and omits the VT.  PS7.2 handles this at the shell level due to things like formatting which happens within the PS engine.  If you run `ls -G > out.txt` within PS7.2, you'll still see that VT is omitted because `ls` decided to omit it.\r\n\r\nI think the way to address this issue while addressing https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements/issues/28 is to change the current regex for removing VT to have a fixed list of known VT codes that will be removed.  This would still need to go through a security review to ensure spoofing doesn't happen.",
