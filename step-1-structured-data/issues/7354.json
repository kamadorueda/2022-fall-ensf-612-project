  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nPreviously you had to use `ConvertFrom-Markdown` and pipe that output to `Show-Markdown` making it cumbersome to use interactively.  Added `-Path` and `-LiteralPath` parameters as well as allowing markdown text to passed directly as `-InputObject` (or via pipeline) to `Show-Markdown`.\r\n\r\nInternally, `Show-Markdown` uses `ConvertFrom-Markdown` to handle these new capabilities.  Removed the use of `Out-Default` which only passed the resulting vt100 text to the console and instead using WriteObject() so that the output can be redirected or captured by scripts or further in the pipeline.  The testhook is still needed when `-UseBrowser` is specified.\r\n\r\nNote I had to fully qualify `PowerShell` and `Path` types due to conflict with `Path` parameter and `PowerShell` namespace.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7338\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
