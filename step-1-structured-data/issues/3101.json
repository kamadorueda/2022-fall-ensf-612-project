  "body": "Main improvements refer to tests of the Write-Host cmdlet.\r\nOriginal tests:\r\n1. Slow because run external processes\r\n2. Don't test colors and -NoNewLine in fact.\r\n\r\nDone:\r\n1. The original tests is preserved (deleted one as redundant) but marked\r\nby 'Slow' tag. They is preserved because they actually check the output\r\non the work, not a test console.\r\n2. Add negative color tests. (Code cover grow!)\r\n3. Add tests based on TestHostCS. This test host has been refined so we\r\ncan see colors and a new line in output.\r\n4. Add minor fixes for test modules loads.\r\n\r\nAlso I add support for Information stream. I originally planned to use\r\nit but not actually used. However, I have left this as a useful addition\r\nfor future tests.\r\nI wonder that a Write-Host console output is duplicated in Information\r\nStream - Is it by design? I left a debug print on this matter in the\r\ntest code.",
