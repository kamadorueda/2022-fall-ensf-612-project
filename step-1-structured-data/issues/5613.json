The only way to reliably follow changes in pre-release software is the change log and release notes, where this change is documented in both. If you look at the PowerShell-Docs repo, you can see this change has been documented in the \"official documentation\" but hasn't been published.  Also, it is extremely likely that when PowerShell Core 6.0.0 is released, this change will be prominently documented and communicated.",
