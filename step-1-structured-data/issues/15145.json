  "body": "It seems that editing the PowerShell settings fails if not running elevated.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n```\r\n1. Open PowerShell without elevation (i.e. from the Start Menu, without selecting Run As Administrator)\r\n2. Right click on the title bar, select  Properties\r\n3. Change any PowerShell setting (i.e. disable Quick Edit and Insert Mode)\r\n4. Click OK to confirm the settings change.\r\n```\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n```\r\n1. Setting takes effect immediately.\r\n2. Setting remains in effect after PowerShell is closed (once opened again).\r\n```\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n```\r\nAn error message is displayed that indicates the setting could not be changed.\r\n![Screenshot 2021-04-02 115557](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/626412/113437058-8b424980-93ab-11eb-9ce2-30610ca9c491.png)\r\n\r\n- It appears the setting is changed in the current PowerShell instance, however this is not clear from the message\r\n- It is clear that the setting does not remain (is not sticky) across instances.\r\n```\r\n## Environment data\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
