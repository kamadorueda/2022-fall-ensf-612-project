  "body": "Hello everyone,\r\nThis is a bug report not directly powershell ( 6.2 ) but windows itself, but thinking that it will be nice to keep it here for reference to someone else hit it again. ( To solve problem )\r\n\r\nWithin windows 10 build 18885 the powershell couldnt run bat files correctly even if you are in same path with the file. On the other hand it is working perfectly with cmd .\r\n\r\nSolution : Just update at least windows 10 build 18890.1000 and everything working perfectly\r\n\r\n",

I am talking about when you try to run any bat file it acts like it couldn't find or access that file, ( I am not even talking about trying to find via path variable even it couldn't execute in the same working directory. I know it is weird but it probably a bug in window 10's build 18885 bug and it only effects PowerShell ( because everything working good in cmd )",
