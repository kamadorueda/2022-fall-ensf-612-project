  "body": "The PSv4+ collection operators `.Where()` and `.ForEach()` differ from normal pipeline-output collecting behavior in two respects:\r\n\r\n* If the result is a _single_ item, it _isn't unwrapped_; that is, a _collection_ is _always_ returned, and\r\n* that collection is always of type `[System.Collections.ObjectModel.Collection[psobject]]` rather than a regular PS array (`[object[]]`)\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/120, the **behavior should be harmonized with how pipeline output is already collected and how the `-*Variable` common parameters (except `-PipelineVariable`) _should_ collect output, according to the RFC**.\r\n\r\nGiven how contentious the linked `-OutVariable`-related RFC is turning out to be, this proposal may need to become an RFC as well, though perhaps the decision on said RFC will imply how to proceed here.\r\n\r\nTo reiterate what, to me, motivates this desire for harmonization / resolving inconsistencies:\r\n\r\n**The unifying vision is to provide a consistent experience whenever PowerShell collects output for you**, so you never need to worry about different unwrapping  behavior and/or differing collection types.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n**This harmonization would currently incur a performance cost**, because the internally used, resizable collection data types must on output be converted to `object[]]`.\r\n\r\nHowever, **the proper way to resolve this is to switch PowerShell's fundamental collection data type from `[object[]]` to an _efficiently resizable_ one that can be used internally _and_ directly output.**\r\n[Discussion in that direction has started](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5643#issuecomment-349811857), but it's obviously a massive _internal_ change; _externally_, assuming no bugs have crept in, however, much of existing code may not only continue to work as-is, but may exhibit automatic performance gains.\r\n\r\nTo quote @lzybkr  from the linked issue:\r\n\r\n> I've often wondered if the comma operator could create a list instead of an array. I have a feeling most scripts would never notice a difference because of how freely things are converted to an object array.\r\n\r\nCurrent Behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> (1).ForEach({$_}).GetType().Name; (1, 2).ForEach({$_}).GetType().Name\r\nCollection`1  # single-item result wasn't unwrapped\r\nCollection`1  # output collection type is not [object[]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDesired Behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> (1).ForEach({$_}).GetType().Name; (1, 2).ForEach({$_}).GetType().Name\r\nInt32      # single-item result was unwrapped\r\nObject[]   # regular PS array\r\n```\r\n",

Methods don't stream so there is no ambiguity as to whether the result should be a collection or not. The design team explicitly decided that they would have consistent behaviour and always return a collection. They return `Collection<PSObject>` both for performance reasons, and because this matches the return type other methods in the PowerShell API. Again, both explicit decisions on the part of the design team. \r\n",

Operators have operator semantics, not command semantics. Operators don't stream.\r\n\r\nThat's a helpful distinction, thank you - and the kind of basic tenet that I wish were documented somewhere.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> This terminology was picked up from LINQ which referred to query methods like where() as \"operators\".\r\n> In query scenarios, methods are simpler and compose more naturally (again see LINQ).\r\n\r\nFor in-PowerShell use (not from C#), methods are an awkward fit, due to the different argument syntax, [as I've tried to argue here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5805#issuecomment-366811092):\r\n\r\n> _Property_ access comes naturally in PowerShell, _method_ calls do not.\r\n>\r\n> Ideally, you never need to call methods - that's what _cmdlets_ are for.\r\n> \r\n> The context switching between PowerShell's argument mode and .NET method syntax is a perennial > pain point, even for experienced users.\r\n> [...]\r\n> Instead, PowerShell uses _operators_ to provide convenient abstractions: Much of what requires method calls in, say, C#, is provided via operators such as -join, -split, -replace, ...\r\n> [...]\r\n> As an aside: consider how PowerShell's one foray into method syntax has fared; the (confusingly named) .ForEach() and .Where() collection operators never gained traction.\r\n\r\nOf course, I now have a better understanding of perhaps the main reason for their not gaining traction, as discussed above.\r\n\r\n> You seem to be making some artificial distinction here. The PowerShell API is part of the regular PowerShell user's experience. Advanced experiences perhaps but not different.\r\n\r\nI think the distinction is real, both conceptually and pragmatically:\r\n\r\n* the API is for controlling PowerShell from the outside (even though you can also use PowerShell scripting to do so; the more typical use case is to use C#, however, methinks)\r\n\r\n* as a regular PowerShell user, you can spend your entire PowerShell life blissfully ignorant of even the existence of the API: you typically don't need it to call cmdlets and write scripts, and the regular `Get-Help` based help system makes no mention of it.\r\n\r\nHence my suggestion to surface `.Where()` and `.ForEach()` as _operators_ `-where` and `-foreach`, ideally with `[object[]]` output for consistency - even though that is clearly implies performance hit, which takes us back to the [discussion of fundamentally changing PowerShell's collection data type](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5643#issuecomment-378467986).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
