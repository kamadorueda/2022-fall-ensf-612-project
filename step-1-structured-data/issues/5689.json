The bad news is that it requires compiling curl from source with the `--with-ssl -with-gssapi` flags and then `pwsh` needs to be started like this `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib pwsh`. I'm not sure what value this has so close to GA release... but at least i can confirm that these features and tests do pass when the environment contains libcurl+openssl+gssapi\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5492#issuecomment-356632711",
