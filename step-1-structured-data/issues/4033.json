It checks if WinRM service is running, startup mode is automatic, listener created, and if the WinRM firewall rule is enabled, but doesn't check if LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy is enabled.  This causes an issue on WS2016 where WinRM is enabled by default so Enable-PSRemoting doesn't set the LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy registry setting compared to WS2012R2.\r\n\r\nReported by customer",
