When using Bash in Ubuntu, you can create a .hushlogin file to turn off the welcom message.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nIs there a config file to do this?",

There should be a config file or an environment variable that allows this without having to add the `-nol` option to every single invocation.\r\n\r\nIt's a bad idea to display the copyright notice on every invocation. It's like a watch that shows you an advert every time you look at it! \r\nIf someone wants to know about the copyright, they should read the documentation or use `pwsh --help` which currently does **not** show the copyright information.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the Linux implementation of `.hushlogin` in `login` is nice, it will only show /etc/motd, /etc/issue or /etc/issue.net if it is more recent than the file. None of the UNIX shells (or even CMD.EXE) display copyright notices on every launch.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion: Support issue #15644 to get rid of the default Logo notice.",

Personally I just expect to be able to pass the `-nologo` setting in someway other than a startup parameter, after all, it is not too late to display the banner after processing `settings.json` or even `profile.ps1`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the one-line banner in this preview build is not annoying, I am very happy to see this change, \r\nit makes `-nologo` flag less important a lot of the time.",

My profile takes about 1.5 seconds to process and not seeing anything get displayed for 1.5 secs is a bit disturbing.  Note that you don't want to display the prompt before processing `profile.ps1` because a lot of folks (including myself) have customized prompt functions.  That said, settings.json may get read in much earlier. But still, not seeing anything displayed for a second or two doesn't make for a great user experience.\r\n\r\nI wonder if PS could benefit from the ANSI/VT equivalent of a \"Splash Screen\"?  That was the whole point of having a splash screen i.e. \"assure the user that the app is really starting up - just taking a while to get the main window up\".  \ud83e\udd23 ",
