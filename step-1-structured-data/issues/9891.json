  "body": "Currently there are several different uses of `-Scope` as a parameter in core PowerShell modules:\r\n\r\n- As a string to identify a PowerShell invocation scope (e.g. when using cmdlets that work with aliases, variables, PSDrives, and modules)\r\n- As a string to identify the profile to work with (e.g. when working with Package Management commands, you can specify CurrentUser or AllUsers, and now when working with experimental features)\r\n- As an ExecutionPolicyScope enumeration to identify the execution policy scope (e.g. when working with the `*-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlets)\r\n\r\nPersonally I've found it confusing when I see that parameter name, assume it means one thing, and then find out in the documentation it means something else. Before this confusion continues, especially within core PowerShell modules, perhaps it would be better if at least some of these used a more explicit parameter name, with `-Scope` as an alias for backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nFor example, in package management and experimental features, `-UserScope` would be more appropriate than simply using `-Scope`. For `*-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlets, `-PolicyScope` would be more appropriate and accurate than simply using `-Scope`.\r\n\r\nThoughts?",

You can't alias `-UserScope` to `-Scope User`.\r\n\r\n> see no reason not to clarify the meaning of these parameters, \r\n\r\nThat's what documentation is for.

      "body": "@bpayette That's not what I meant.\r\n\r\nMy issue is that there are three distinct parameter types for `-Scope` parameters among modules that ship with PowerShell, and when I see `-Scope` I may need to go to the docs to see what it's for when it would be better if I didn't have to.\r\n\r\nIf the `*-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlets instead had a `-PolicyScope` parameter (with an alias of `Scope` for backward compatibility), and if the PowerShellGet/PackageManagement cmdlets and the `*-ExperimentalFeature` cmdlets instead had a `-UserScope` parameter (with an alias of `Scope` for backward compatibility), then the parameters would be more self-explanatory.\r\n\r\nDoes that make more sense? Maybe the part that confused you was the `-UserScope` parameter name proposal. I suppose it could be called `-ProfileScope` instead, but having it just called `-Scope` by default with values of `CurrentUser` and `AllUsers` when other cmdlets in PowerShell have `-Scope` parameters that take values such as `Global`, `Local`, `Script`, or a numeric value, that difference in definition of scope (the difference between commands, not within one command) is a confusion point that could be eliminated.\r\n\r\nCase in point: when I was looking at `*-ExperimentalFeature` cmdlets and I saw `-Scope`, I initially presumed that it was referring to a PowerShell invocation scope where you could enable the feature, and didn't realize it was about enabling those features for the current user or for all users on the local system instead.",

If the Committee buys in, I'll submit the PRs.\r\n\r\nThe tl;dr of this is:\r\n\r\nPowerShell uses \"scope\" to refer to the activation stack of the currently running script. Because of that, a `-Scope` parameter name on `Import-Module`, `Get-Variable`, etc. makes sense. There are other uses of `-Scope` as a parameter name that cause confusion: `Enable-ExperimentalFeature` and `Disable-ExperimentalFeature`, for example, as well as commands in PowerShellGet/PackageManagement and the `Get-/Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlets. I think we should consider changing the name of `-Scope` in those commands to something more appropriate, with `-Scope` as an alias for backwards compatibility. @BrucePay's suggestion of `-For` is a really good alternative parameter name that makes commands self-documenting in all of those cases.",
