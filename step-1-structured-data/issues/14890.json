Recently we are trying to upgrade PowerShell to the latest release v7.1.2, but its got failed with the following errors\r\n\r\n============Logs(S)============\r\n/usr/lib/dotnet/sdk/5.0.103/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.PackageDependencyResolution.targets(241,5): error NETSDK1005: Assets file '/usr/src/photon/BUILD/PowerShell-7.1.2/src/powershell-unix/obj/project.assets.json' doesn't have a target for 'netcoreapp3.1'.
