  "body": "This is a long-standing bug that also affects Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, `-Credential` can be used to start a process in a new window with a given user identity.\r\n\r\nCurrently, doing so effectively prevents interactive use of both the caller's window and the new window, because they seem to be competing for keyboard input.\r\n\r\nNote: Curiously, if you start `powershell.exe` specifically, the problem does _not_ occur; other shells, however - such as `pwsh` itself and `cmd` - do exhibit the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn Windows (_update_: problem verified on Windows 10 versions 1809 and 1909 - see `(Get-ComputerInfo).WindowsVersion`)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Enter a different user's credentials (or even your own) when prompted.\r\nSet-Location C:\\; Start-Process cmd -Credential (Get-Credential)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe call should return after having launched the `cmd` process and both the calling shell and the `cmd` shell in the new window should function normally and independently.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nTyping in either window either has no effect or sometimes makes what was typed show up in the respective other window.\r\n\r\nBehavior returns to normal when the new window is closed.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core v7.0.0 (7.0.0) on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1909, OS Build: 18363.720)\r\n```\r\n",
