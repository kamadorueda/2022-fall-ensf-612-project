The method basically just constructs an instance of `PSArgumentNullException`\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/39756d5602546d5956d4e8d87922efa1e35f0d83/src/System.Management.Automation/utils/MshTraceSource.cs#L229-L240\r\n\r\nSo the code in the OP really is just missing `throw` (or should be removed, or turned into an `Assert`)",
