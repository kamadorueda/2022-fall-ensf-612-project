      "body": "That would be an excellent improvement.\r\n\r\nIdeally, this should also work  for flag (bit-field) enumerations, so that something like the following would work:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Sample flags enumeration.\r\n[Flags()] enum Foo { first = 0x1; second = 0x2; third = 0x4 }\r\n\r\n# Tab-complete flag values inside strings too (with or without a closing quote present).\r\n[Foo] 'first, th'<tab>  # -> 'first, third', tantamount to [Foo]::first -bor [Foo]::third\r\n```",

      "body": "Good question, @SeeminglyScience.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking that even `$ErrorActionPreference = <tab>` (no opening quote) should complete to a _string_ (e.g, `$ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'`), for two reasons:\r\n\r\n* Using types and static properties is an advanced technique, and strings are more concise and provide better symmetry with use in _arguments_ (e.g., `-ErrorAction Stop`), where use of the static property expression would be impractical (e.g., `-ErrorAction ([System.Management.Automation.ActionPreference]::Stop)`)\r\n\r\n* With flag enumerations, a string value is easier to modify later (again with tab-completion support), especially when new flags are added (e.g., `'Compiled'` -> `'Compiled, IgnoreCase'` vs. `[System.Text.RegularExpressions.RegexOptions]::Compiled` -> `[System.Text.RegularExpressions.RegexOptions]::Compiled -bor [System.Text.RegularExpressions.RegexOptions]::IgnoreCase`)\r\n",
