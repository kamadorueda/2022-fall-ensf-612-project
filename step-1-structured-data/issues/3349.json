  "body": "It looks like we've already published our CentOS packages (which hopefully shouldn't need to be different than RHEL packages) to our [RHEL 7](http://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/7/) and [RHEL 7.3](http://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/7.3/) repositories. Going forward, we should:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Test these packages on RHEL 7.2 and 7.3 on same cadence to ensure that are working properly \r\n- [ ] Remove \"centos\" from the package name to indicate that the RPM is universal across CentOS and RHEL ([as .NET Core has done](http://destek.serbestinternet.com/rhel-repo/rhel-7-server-dotnet-rpms/Packages/))",

However, the difference between RHEL and CentOS is even less than I previously understood, so I'm now proposing that we just test again CentOS 7.2 and/or 7.3 in addition to 7.1. \r\n\r\nLet's talk offline on which we should do and how we prioritize them.
