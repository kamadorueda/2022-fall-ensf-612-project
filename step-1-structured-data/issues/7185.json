Today, I am unable to run file imports that work on other versions (5.1.16299.431 is working fine on my local machine, Windows 10). I'm not 100% sure that this is a bug, but I can't reproduce on other versions and there doesn't appear to be any link I could find to get an upgrade on the OS I'm using. The latest update was KB4284833 run overnight.\r\n\r\n- Does this look like an end user issue?\r\n- Is there a way to upgrade Windows Server 2016 PS to 5.1.16299.431 (working)?\r\n\r\nTest Code:\r\n--------------------------\r\n_ZipFiles.ps1_\r\n```\r\nParam ($type)\r\n\r\n$ScriptDirectory = Split-Path -Path $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Definition -Parent\r\n$date = get-date -UFormat %Y%m%d\r\n$Logfile = \"$ScriptDirectory\\FileManagement-$date.log\"\r\ntry {\r\n    .

Any Windows PowerShell issue should be address thru the UserVoice forum: https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell \r\n\r\nThis is as stated in the PowerShell Core landing page: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#windows-powershell-vs-powershell-core\r\n\r\nNow, I would recommend to test the issue on a later Windows 10 build (> 16299) or Insider edition as we've seen issues been corrected on later builds.\r\n\r\n:)",
