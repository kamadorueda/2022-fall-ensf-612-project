Plus a `Search-AppxPackage` would also be nice.",

Virtually no Windows Powershell management tools have been touched in years. If the Windows feature teams can't even create PowerShell 7 native cmdlets, extending existing modules is highly unlikely. I suggest the best solution to be a rich App Store module for the Gallery.  \n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://cdn.techcommunity.microsoft.com/assets/MTC_Open_graph_image1.jpg\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>TECHCOMMUNITY.MICROSOFT.COM</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/\">Microsoft Tech Community</a></strong></div></blockquote>",

The `Download-AppxPackage` function just used `Invoke-WebRequest` to download the .APPX file. so should be safe. As to whether they work - harder to say. The _should_ wor,k, but I have not tested them and am NOT an APPX expert!\r\n\r\nAs a suggestion, for help on stuff like this, consider looking at the  [Spiceworks PowerShell Forum](https://community.spiceworks.com/programming/powershell). The regulars there may be able to provide more help.\r\n",
