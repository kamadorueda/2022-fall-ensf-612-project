  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently, Set-StrictMode -Version accepts \"latest\" to indicate the most recent version of StrictMode. It would be beneficial to also accept \"off\" and remove the Set-StrictMode -Off option. The \"off\" option would turn StrictMode to version 0.0\r\n\r\nUsage: Set-StrictMode -Version off\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nInvoke-Command -StrictMode allows \"off\" as a parameter.\r\nRefer to this pull request https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/16545#discussion_r782709242\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "IMHO, I think `off` may not be a suitable value for `Set-StrictMode -Version`. `-Version latest` means the latest version, but `-Version off` doesn't seem to make sense that naturally. The parameter `-StrictMode` in `Invoke-Command` is different from `-Version`, and thus `-StrictMode off` reads much more naturally than `-Version off`.",
