Consequently, is systemd a prerequisite of PowerShell via Linux? Despite all of what I stated, I am supportive of this proposition.",

If .Net hasn't API to set timezone PowerShell can not set timezone too. Sometimes PowerShell uses OS specific p/invokes but only if they is a standard like POSIX, otherwise it would be very difficult to implement, test and support.",
