  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nMaybe this is already implemented and I just can't find it, but it would be nice to be able to create a unix time instead of just converting from them. I know about the `-unixTimeSeconds` param. But I need to be able to convert a date to that time format.\r\ni.e. `Get-date -ToUnixTime` would get the date in seconds since the epoch.\r\nOr `Get-Date 11:00 -ToUnixTime` would get 11 am today in an integer that is the seconds since the epoch at 11 am today.\r\n\r\nCould also be a method of the datetime object.\r\ni.e. `(Get-Date 11:00).ToUnixTime()` if that's an easier thing to implement.\r\n\r\nI would gladly do a pull request myself, I just would need a little help finding where the code for Get-Date is (I found the get-date tests but not the actual code).\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nAdd something like this to a switch param in `Get-Date` or to a method of the datetime object\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Get-SecsSinceEpoch {\r\nparam (\r\n    $scheduleDate = (Get-Date)\r\n)\r\n    process {\r\n        $EpochDiff = New-TimeSpan \"01 January 1970 00:00:00\" $($scheduleDate)\r\n        $EpochSecs = [INT] $EpochDiff.TotalSeconds - [timezone]::CurrentTimeZone.GetUtcOffset($(get-date)).totalseconds\r\n        return $EpochSecs\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI did nab this code from https://jamgotre.blogspot.com/2011/02/powershell-seconds-since-1970.html and just put it in a function\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-JJ",
