  "body": "When validating the .NET Core RTM drop in NanoServer, we found two issues that cause powershell.exe and pwrshplugin.dll crash:\n1. Bug in AssemblyLoadContext causes Resolving event doesn't work [https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/5837](url)\n2. Bug in JIT causes the call from native code to managed code to break when standard IO is redirected (pwrshplugin.dll is hosted by WinRM service, and WinRM service redirect the IO when creating host process). [https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/6460](url)\n\nCoreCLR team has approved the work to drop NuGet packages for the 2 powershell fixes. So we need to adopt the new package for PowerShell as soon as they come out.\n- [x] Adopt the new CoreCLR nuget packages that contains 2 powershell fixes\n- [x] Make OSPS depend on Newtonsoft.Json 9.0\n",
