You can also see that the curser is on the same line as the and when text is typed it writes over the progress bar. Maybe the progress bar should be hidden when the debugger is displayed or detached from the bottom of the prompt.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nThe progress bar does not causes display issues with the prompt.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe progress bar stays at the bottom of the interactive prompt and causes display issues.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/38873752/172968790-0567c46f-3ea8-4479-af15-cf330cea8bcf.png)\r\n",
