  "body": "I would like to suggest that the Windows Backup PowerShell's commands to accept  a folder in the same disk in the hypervisor host as a target. Another software of Backup like Veeam is possible to do this. There's no sense require only a entire disk or only network share to do this.\r\nIt would be better accept any folder in the Hypervisror host as a target to save the backup.\r\n\r\nSomething like: New-WBBackupTarget -folder c:\\some_folder_as_backup_destiny\r\n\r\nThanks",
