  "body": "First off, congrats on the release!! Super excited!\n\nThe macOS pkg on the download page is not signed which means it can't be \"double-clicked\" on macOS, you have to right click and choose Open. Also, signing in general is goodness :). I know we did it for the .NET Core SDK package, so I might be able to point you at folks who have done it (email is [github user name]@microsoft.com)\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Download macOS PKG from repo home page\n2. Run `pkgutil --check-signature ~/Downloads/powershell-6.0.0-alpha.9.pkg`\n## Expected behavior\n\nSomething like:\n\n```\nPackage \"powershell-6.0.0-alpha.9.pkg\":\n   Status: signed by a certificate trusted by Mac OS X\n   Certificate Chain:\n    1. blah blah blah...\n```\n## Actual behavior\n\n```\nPackage \"powershell-6.0.0-alpha.9.pkg\":\n   Status: no signature\n```\n## Environment data\n\nNot relevant, not an issue in PowerShell itself :)\n",
