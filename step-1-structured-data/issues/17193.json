  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI am experiencing a problem with connecting to Office 365 to administer it using PowerShell in Docker. I am using the mcr.microsoft.com/azure-powershell Docker image on Debian.\r\n\r\nTo connect to the Office 365 servers, I use following snippet:\r\n```powershell\r\n$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid -Credential $null -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection -ErrorAction Stop\r\nImport-PSSession $Session -ErrorAction Stop\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis issue is related to #16615 as they share the same error message. There is a workaround described, which indeed works, however a permanent solution should be implemented to fix this issue as, in my opinion, this is a use case which worked before out of box and should continue to work out of box with the official Docker image.\r\n\r\nThanks for your work on PowerShell.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPowerShell credential request\r\nEnter your credentials.\r\nUser: xxx@xxxx.com\r\nPassword for user x: *********************\r\n\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\nPS>\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPowerShell credential request\r\nEnter your credentials.\r\nUser: xxx@xxxx.com\r\nPassword for user x: *********************\r\n\r\npwsh: symbol lookup error: /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/libmi.so: undefined symbol: SSL_library_init\r\n# exits docker container runtime\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\n# I cannot execute Get-Error afterwards because PowerShell is forcefully exiting the session\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nPS> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Linux 5.16.0-5-amd64 #1 SMP PREEMPT Debian 5.16.14-1 (2022-03-15)\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nPS>\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
