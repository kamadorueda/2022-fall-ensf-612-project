  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nPowershell currently has a property called extension which returns a files extension. Currently this only returns the value after the final dot character in a files name. However some files have a chain of extensions (eg '.tar.gz'). Therefore I suggest modifying the extension property to return an array of a files extensions [like pythons suffixes property](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#pathlib.PurePath.suffixes).\r\n",

      "body": "Currently I look how our ResGen works and it interpret a file name as visibility.namespace.classname.resx where namespace may contains dots. So extension is not \"a chain of extensions\" in general.\r\nCommon convention is that extension is a part after last dot. .Net follows this and we follow .Net.\r\n\r\nUsers can easily get suffixes by split operator. Also users can use ETS to add suffixes property to Path type.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth adding to Engine.\r\n",
