  "body": "This is part of the overall problem in #939. Our previous CoreConsoleHost avoided a myriad of problems that occur when a `RawUserInterface` class is created and used but no TTY exists (which causes most `System.Console` methods to throw, and these exceptions can be silenced in formatters).\n\nThis is not a blocker to merge the console hosts, but it does introduce regressions (see disabled tests in said PR). Most likely the correct way to solve this is to eliminate the dependency on the `RawUI` class when no TTY exists (and thus PowerShell is by necessity running non-interactively).\n\nThis blocks some scenarios from working when not in a TTY (say, automated scripts).\n",
