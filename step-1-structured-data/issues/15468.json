  "body": "We have a AAD Conditional Access Policy in place which blocks unknown operating systems for our enterprise apps and users. \r\n\r\nWhen using PowerShell 7.1.3, the operating system is showing as empty in \"device info\" under the \"sign-in log within AAD. This has resulted in blocking access to our Enterprise App (SharePoint PnP PowerShell). \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2369339/119807504-1a1aa080-bedb-11eb-8676-c81949f78245.png)\r\n\r\nWhen we use PowerShell 5.1, the operating system; \"Windows 10\" is shown and access is granted to our Enterprise App. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2369339/119807613-37e80580-bedb-11eb-8a89-6594b4f0f499.png)\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1.

Enter credentials\r\n\r\n## Expected behaviour\r\n\r\nAccess token is provided.\r\n\r\n## Actual behaviour\r\n\r\nAccess token is not provided:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nConnect-PnPOnline: AADSTS53003: Access has been blocked by Conditional Access policies.
