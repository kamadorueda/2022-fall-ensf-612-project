  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWhile PS is quite useful for many tasks, I find that basic things like writing/editing a file is not as easy as it would be on unix/linux that are usually bundled with `vi` or `nano`.\r\n\r\nI understand that it might not be the right place to this feature request, so there might be a better place for this feature request.\r\n\r\nMaybe the old `edit.exe` would do the trick?\r\n\r\nIs there any plans to provide such tool for Windows command line?\r\n\r\nI believe `vi` is being able to handle very large files which could be a plus.\r\n",
