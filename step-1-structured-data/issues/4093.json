For JEA scenarios, this means an auditor trying to understand how someone was able to do a certain command will not know through which endpoint the user entered and was assigned those privileges.\r\n\r\nSuggestion is to add a new line to the transcript header similar to the following:\r\n\r\nConfigurationName: MyJEAEndpoint",
