I had to use my personal computer to get into Github, so I can relay this message.\r\n\r\nI have even tried the following link: https://mikefrobbins.com/2019/07/11/install-powershell-7-with-jeff-hicks-psreleasetools-module/.  Still got errors and would not copy it.\r\n\r\nPlease work on another option to install PowerShell 7 (especially when it is fully released), for businesses that have the Microsoft Store and GitHub blocked.",
