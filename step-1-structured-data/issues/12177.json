For example, do this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[Management.Automation.PSSerializer]::Deserialize([Management.Automation.PSSerializer]::Serialize((gi .)))|gm\r\n```\r\n\r\n`BaseName` is present with the above.  In order for `ScriptProperty`'s to be serialized the following conditions need to be met:\r\n\r\n1. The thread where the serializer is called must have a default runspace\r\n1. The default runspace must have a currently active pipeline\r\n1. The execution thread for that pipeline must be the same thread that the serializer was called on\r\n\r\nIn other words, you need to call it from the pipeline thread while controlling pipeline execution, otherwise it isn't safe. My guess is that `Start-Job` calls the serializer on a different thread for performance.",
