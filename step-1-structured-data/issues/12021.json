  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6?view=powershell-6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\nCreate a simple Windows form that utilizes the \"Test-Connection\" cmdlet.  In practice the form is more complex - but the example below provides a simple test to reproduce the issue and eliminate extra complexity.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms\r\n$Form = New-Object system.Windows.Forms.Form\r\n$Form.Text = \"Sample Form\"\r\n$Button = New-Object Windows.Forms.Button\r\n$Button.Text = \"Test\"\r\n$Button.Location = New-Object Drawing.Point(100,100)\r\n$Button.Add_Click({\r\n    $Button.Text = \"Running...\"\r\n    $Button.Enabled = $false\r\n    Test-Connection $env:COMPUTERNAME -Count 3 -Quiet\r\n    $Button.Text = \"Test\"\r\n    $Button.Enabled = $true\r\n})\r\n$Form.Controls.Add($button)\r\n$Form.ShowDialog()\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nTest-Connection should complete and continue on with the script.  This cmdlet works correctly when running from command line or non-form based script.  When called from a Windows form, the Test-Connection just hangs the script/form indefinitely.  I have tried various combinations of parameters such as removing \"-quiet\" and \"-count\".  Maybe this is not a bug, and I am just overlooking some parameter or alternate method to call this cmdlet.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nForm hangs; you have to kill the Pwsh.exe process.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
