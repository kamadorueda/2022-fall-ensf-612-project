Everything must use these now.\n>   - added single argument syntax for `gulp.task` which allows a named function to be used as the name of the task and task function.\n>   - added `gulp.tree` method for retrieving the task tree. Pass `{ deep: true }` for an `archy` compatible node list.\n>   - added `gulp.registry` for setting custom registries.\n> \n> ### CLI changes\n> \n> - split CLI out into a module if you want to save bandwidth/disk space. you can install the gulp CLI using either `npm install gulp -g` or `npm install gulp-cli -g`, where gulp-cli is the smaller one (no module code included)\n> - add `--tasks-json` flag to CLI to dump the whole tree out for other tools to consume\n> - added `--verify` flag to check the dependencies in package.json against the plugin blacklist.\n> \n> ### vinyl/vinyl-fs changes\n> \n> - added `gulp.symlink` which functions exactly like `gulp.dest`, but symlinks instead.\n> - added `dirMode` param to `gulp.dest` and `gulp.symlink` which allows better control over the mode of the destination folder that is created.\n> - globs passed to `gulp.src` will be evaluated in order, which means this is possible `gulp.src(['*.js', '!b*.js', 'bad.js'])` (exclude every JS file that starts with a b except bad.js)\n> - performance for gulp.src has improved massively\n>   - `gulp.src(['**/*', '!b.js'])` will no longer eat CPU since negations happen during walking now\n> - added `since` option to `gulp.src` which lets you only match files that have been modified since a certain date (for incremental builds)\n> - fixed `gulp.src` not following symlinks\n> - added `overwrite` option to `gulp.dest` which allows you to enable or disable overwriting of existing files\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Commits</summary>\n\n- [`069350a`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/069350a5febf65adc27bc816a7805471b7d96f03) Release: 4.0.2\n- [`b4b5a68`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/b4b5a68373b4c58d6b92321cea64a6ffcc3ff042) Build: Add node 12 to Travis & Azure\n- [`5667666`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/5667666ffae15c169f99c7096ca59c05f9440272) Fix: Bind src/dest/symlink to the gulp instance to support esm exports (ref s...\n- [`4091bd3`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/4091bd3aff08801625c6128eec079af4a7b5dccb) Docs: Add notes about esm support (closes [#2278](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2278))\n- [`3c66d95`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/3c66d95f014b99f79e0375c43cfa17a7269732a2) Docs: Fix the Negative Globs section & examples (closes [#2297](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2297))\n- [`1693a11`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/1693a1127116a6804a892a4b931c232b1bec9162) Docs: Remove next tag from recipes (closes [#2277](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2277))\n- [`d916276`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/d9162761f276fce5fe54bc0a60c7eb9efcd5e249) Docs: Add default task wrappers to Watching Files examples to make runnable (...\n- [`ea52a92`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/ea52a927843ff0e84f142f85813572bd5144a656) Docs: Fix syntax error in lastRun API docs (closes [#2315](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2315))\n- [`5d81f42`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/5d81f42f9ddc4aa0a0721057eff8b8e24b65861c) Docs: Fix typo in Explaining Globs ([#2326](https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/gulpjs/gulp/issues/2326))\n- [`ea3bba4`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/commit/ea3bba4fdf9f2b508699f69569d0191b8c5bc10c) Release: 4.0.1\n- Additional commits viewable in [compare view](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/compare/v3.9.1...v4.0.2)\n</details>\n<br />\n\n[![Dependabot compatibility score](https://api.dependabot.com/badges/compatibility_score?dependency-name=gulp&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=3.9.1&new-version=4.0.2)](https://dependabot.com/compatibility-score.html?dependency-name=gulp&package-manager=npm_and_yarn&previous-version=3.9.1&new-version=4.0.2)\n\nDependabot will resolve any conflicts with this PR as long as you don't alter it yourself.
