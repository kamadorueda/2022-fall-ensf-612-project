  "body": "Issue from @keystroke.\r\n\r\nWhen a new X509Certificate2 object is created with the empty constructor, it succeeds. However, it is initialised with its `Handle` property set to `IntPtr.Zero`. So accessing certain properties on that object try to dereference that `Handle` and cause an access violation.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$cert = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2]::new(); $cert.SendAsTrustedIssue\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nValue is possibly `$null` or `False`.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nPowerShell crashes (the window disappears)\r\n\r\nFurther Information\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nAlso try\r\n```powershell\r\n[System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509Certificate2]::new() | fl *\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis crash reproduces back to Windows PowerShell 5.1.\r\n\r\nThe property accessed in the particular repro is a script property that triggers this method:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/8d4dd1e58f025ca576d38846b9adb5bdeeafd505/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/security/CertificateProvider.cs#L2958-L2988\r\n\r\nIt seems that `X509Certificate2` has a property called `Handle` which is set to `IntPtr.Zero` by default, causing the access violation.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18242\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

The X509Certificate2 wrapper code really needs an alternate code path in all its properties for when there's no underlying certificate (i.e. `Handle` is null) -- or perhaps they should lazily create one?",
