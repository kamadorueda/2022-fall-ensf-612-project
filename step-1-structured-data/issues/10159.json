  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nI would love a way to block aliases from being imported when I import a module, or from being loaded when PowerShell loads.\r\nAs a user, I find it annoying to have to run 'Remove-Item -Path Alias:* -Force' each time I have imported a module, in order to be sure that other modules will import successfully.\r\nThe underlying reasons is that a number of modules use the same aliases, and this prevents scripts from loading them.\r\nFor-Example: Get-VM is used by the modules virtualmachinemanager, Hyper-V & PowerCLI.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nA -NoAliases switch could be added to the Import-Module cmdlet, which would prevent aliases from being created. \r\nAlternatively, the existing -force switch could be enhanced to overwrite existing aliases rather than failing to import the module.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nImport-Module -Name Hyper-V -NoAlias\r\nThis would import the Hyper-V module, but without importing any aliases from the module.\r\n\r\n",
