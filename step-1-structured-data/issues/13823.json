  "body": "I'm writing a module that implements a plug-in provider model like the PSProvider system. The core cmdlets can take dynamic parameters defined by the module implementing the provider. How do inform PowerShell that help for a dynamic parameter resides in another help file? I found that `RuntimeDefinedParameterDictionary` has a `HelpFile` property but no code references the property. Even if it did work I would be limited to only a single help file for a single module. I would need to support dynamic parameters from different help files.\r\n\r\nThe help system supports PSProviders by using the `ICmdletProviderSupportsHelp` interface but, is not generic for other provider like modules to make use of.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/4b9b0788ed28ea6d463ce857d1ed81bd4a977a59/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/PseudoParameters.cs#L222-L230",
