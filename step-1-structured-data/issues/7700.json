  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n_Update: Added a filter function._\r\n\r\nCompare the performance of extracting the `.Name` property values from 1 million objects:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# PSv3+ operation statement (using parameters directly rather than a script block)\r\n(Measure-Command { , (Get-Item /) * 1e6 | ForEach-Object Name }).TotalSeconds\r\n# Script block\r\n(Measure-Command { , (Get-Item /) * 1e6 | ForEach-Object { $_.Name } }).TotalSeconds\r\n# Filter function\r\nfilter Name { $_.Name }\r\n(Measure-Command { , (Get-Item /) * 1e6 | Name }).TotalSeconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n<sup>Note: `(, (Get-Item /) * 1e6).Name` - i.e., member enumeration - is the fastest by far, but this issue is about comparing _streaming_ approaches.</sup>\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nAt the very least comparable performance.\r\n\r\nPresumably, not having to evaluate a script block in each iteration has the potential to be faster.\r\n\r\nI would expect a filter function to perform similarly to the script-block solution.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe operation statement is noticeably _slower_ than the script block.\r\n\r\nSample timings (averaged across 10 runs) on  Windows, macOs, Ubuntu show varying ratios, ranging from the operation statement taking `1.24` as long to `1.58` to `1.85`, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe factor for Windows PowerShell was `1.40`.\r\n\r\nThe filter function is _by far the fastest_, by a factor of about _10_ on macOS.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.1.0-rc.1 on macOS 10.13.6\r\nPowerShell Core v6.1.0-rc.1 on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.1.0-rc.1 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1803, OS Build: 17134.165)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.17134.165 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1803, OS Build: 17134.165)\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "I'm seeing very different results.\r\n\r\nFirst, my first few runs of the test had wildly varying results (on PS5.1), but for the life of me I don't know why. After some experimentation I ended up with this, which gave more consistent results:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$big = , (Get-Item /) * 1e6\r\n\r\n# PSv3+ operation statement (using parameters directly rather than a script block)\r\n(Measure-Command { $big | ForEach-Object Name }).TotalSeconds\r\n# Script block\r\n(Measure-Command { $big | ForEach-Object { $_.Name } }).TotalSeconds\r\n```\r\nOn Windows PowerShell 5.1, direct property access takes me 12-13 seconds, whereas the scriptblock takes 6-7.\r\n\r\nOn PowerShell Core 6.1.0-rc.1 (official release; not one I built myself) (windows amd64), direct property access still takes 12-13 seconds... but scriptblock now takes 9 seconds.\r\n\r\nSo I do observe a slowdown from PS5.1 to PS6... but it's in scriptblock processing.\r\n\r\nOh... wait... you are saying that you expect direct prop access to be not slower than scriptblock...\r\n\r\nWell, the two have very different code paths... and it's not hard to pick out a thing or two that seem like they would make things way slower, such as in the prop access path, we format a \"should process\" string, and then call `ShouldProcess` *for every single input object*.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    // should process\r\n    string propertyAction = String.Format(CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,\r\n        InternalCommandStrings.ForEachObjectPropertyAction, resolvedPropertyName);\r\n\r\n    if (ShouldProcess(_targetString, propertyAction))\r\n    {\r\n        try\r\n        {\r\n            WriteToPipelineWithUnrolling(_propGetter.GetValue(InputObject, resolvedPropertyName));\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas for the scriptblock path, we just blast through and execute the script for every input.\r\n\r\nAt the very least you could try lifting out the `propertyAction` string to avoid the `String.Format` for every input, but note that you can't just lift it straight out--the `resolvedPropertyName` could theoretically be different for every input object (but not very likely...)--so you would have to cache it, for strictly equivalent behavior.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know how much difference that would make... maybe `ShouldProcess` is more expensive. :/\r\n\r\nAnyway, has anybody else noticed/filed the slowdown of the scriptblock path from 5.1 to 6?\r\n",

All of this leads me to believe that there should be a much simpler solution available. I'm not certain if I have the background know-how in terms of improving it significantly, but it certainly looks like it could use some improvement.",

      "body": "It would be a mistake to make this just about member resolution. I mean, yes, the member resolution needs to be faster, but even scriptblock execution is an order of magnitude _slower_ than just the call operator with a scriptblock.\r\n\r\nObviously the fastest way (by far) to get a single member is just to use member unrolling (i.e., wrap the expression in a parenthesis and write the property name), which is several times faster than even a filter...\r\n\r\n| Duration| CommandLine\r\n| --------| -----------\r\n| 6.91423 | $Names = $lots \\| % Name |\r\n| 4.41294 | $Names = $lots \\| % { $_.Name } |\r\n| 0.83100 | $Names = foreach($f in $lots) { $f.Name } |\r\n| 0.64787 | $Names = $lots \\| nameFilter |\r\n| 0.55108 | $Names = $lots \\| &{process{$_.ToString()}} |\r\n| 0.20108 | $Names = $lots.Name |\r\n\r\nMy point is that while we should be concerned about the speed of `% Name` versus `% { $_.Name }` this cmdlet is slower in everything it does than any other way of doing those things!\r\n\r\nWe should also be _very_ concerned about the speed of `% { $_.Name }` versus ` &{process{ $_.

There's a few ways you can pass them in, but that's all just to support calling it without explicitly naming the script blocks (and still allow infinitely many `process` blocks).\r\n\r\nI doubt that's going to account for the slowdown. I'm guessing most of it is due to trying to cheat scope.",
