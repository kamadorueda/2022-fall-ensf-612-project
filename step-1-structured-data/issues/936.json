I assume you have a WIP branch somewhere with the project.json that makes this build?\n\nWe should probably not merge this until we can confirm things build correctly, but I'll leave it up so we have the files imported with the right information.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/936)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
