An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could retrieve content, that is normally restricted, from a web application.\r\n\r\nThe security update addresses the vulnerability by enforcing CORS configuration to prevent its bypass.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update PowerShell Core to an unaffected version (See [Affected Software](#user-content-affected-software)).\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use dotnet/corefx#34428 for discussion of the .NET aspects this advisory.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\">Affected Software</a>\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects PowerShell Core prior to the following versions:\r\n\r\n| PowerShell Core Version | Fixed in          |\r\n|-------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| 6.1                     | 6.1.2             |\r\n| 6.2                     | TBD               |\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in [Affected Software](#user-content-affected-software) to see if your version of PowerShell Core is affected.\r\n1. If you are running a version of PowerShell Core where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Installing PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\r\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\r\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\r\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\r\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\r\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\r\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\r\n\r\nSee [acknowledgments](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/acknowledgments) for more information.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2019-0545](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0545)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 15, 2019): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n*Version 1.0*\r\n*Last Updated 2018-01-15*\r\n",
