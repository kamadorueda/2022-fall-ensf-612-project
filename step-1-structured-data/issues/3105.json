  "body": "I really like the ability to call any tool from powershell.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have autocomplete when using exe's whithin a powershell script\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n\r\n`\r\ngit clone https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell.git -branch master\r\n`\r\nit would be nice it after typeing `git clone https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell.git -` and `tab` it would complete to `branch` (or another option).\r\n\r\nA possible implementation could be to create wrapper functions for each exe methods.\r\n\r\nfor example:\r\n````ps1\r\nfunction git-clone {\r\n\tparam(\r\n\t\t[ValidatePattern('(?:git|ssh|https?|git@[\\w\\.]+):(?:\\/\\/)?[\\w\\.@:\\/~_-]+\\.git(?:\\/?|\\#[\\d\\w\\.\\-_]+?)')]\r\n\t\t[Parameter(Mandatory=$True, ValueFromPipeline)]\r\n\t\t[string]$giturl,\r\n\r\n\t\t[alias('b')]\r\n\t\t[string]$branch\r\n\t)\r\n\r\n\t$expression = \"git clone $giturl\"\r\n\r\n\tif($branch){\r\n\t\t$expression += \" -branch $branch\"\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\tif($noHardlinks){\r\n\t\t$expression += ' --no-hardlinks'\r\n\t}\r\n\r\n\t#Invoke-Expression $expression\r\n}\r\n````\r\n\r\nthis could be a project like https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped that is used just for autocomplete",

I don't think it makes a lot of sense for PowerShell itself to go implementing all native EXE parameters: even we wanted to maintain a massive database of all native binary parameters (we don't), many are contextual anyway (the problem posh-git and TE++ work to solve). \r\n\r\nThat being said, I know I've briefly discussed with @lzybkr the possibility of parsing man pages on Linux to provide some automated propagation of IntelliSense (which would be really cool with PSReadline Tooltips that show the description, or in [VS Code](https://github.com/powershell/vscode-powershell), but I don't think anyone is planning to do that work any time soon.
