  "body": "Based on the test output, it looks like two possible problems occurring:\r\n\r\n1. test is timing out so it may be taking longer than 5 seconds to run, so increase timeout\r\n2. the errfile from the previous run wasn't removed, not sure where test is writing that file, so moved it to the testdrive\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4561\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
