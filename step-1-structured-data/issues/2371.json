I see that you added use of PowerShellAssemblyLoadContext, but why is that necessary? Your instructions specify copying all the necessary assemblies into the bin directory, so shouldn't that negate the need for our ALC?\n3. xUnit supports [Trait]s, so why are special Fact overrides necessary?\ncc @JamesWTruher \n",
