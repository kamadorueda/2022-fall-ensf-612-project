Either that or a more complicated regex (not very in favour of that but it might be what we need).",

There are plenty of APIs that accept an array of arrays where the outer array may contain 0 or more inner arrays. \r\n\r\nThe current behavior of `ConvertTo-Json 1,2` is `[1,2]` which means when I need to send `[[1,2]]` I have to do some string manipulation of my own.",
