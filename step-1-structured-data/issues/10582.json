If you use .net standard, then you will need to reference the PowerShell.standard library, which can also be used for Windows PowerShell (aka full .net). If you don't want/can use the standard library, you will need to multitarget net462 or similar and SMA 5.1 for binaries that work for Windows PowerShell",
