  "author": "user8446",
  "body": "According to the [official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-restmethod?view=powershell-7.1), up through PowerShell v7.2 when attaching a file in the form with `Invoke-RestMethod`, the MIMEtype is hardcoded to `application/octet-stream`. From the docs:\r\n\r\n`\"If the value is a System.IO.FileInfo object, then the binary file contents will be submitted. The name of the file will be submitted as the filename. The MIME will be set as application/octet-stream. Get-Item can be used to simplify supplying the System.IO.FileInfo object.\"`\r\n\r\nHowever, when uploading different file types to various API's, the MIMEtype needs to match the file being uploaded or it doesn't work. For example: `application/pdf`, `image/jpeg`, `text/plain`.\r\n\r\nI consider this a bug as to not simply be able to change the MIMEtype causes `Invoke-RestMethod` to not be usable for many API's. I have searched and I could not find where this is changeable. \r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nFor the MIMEtype to be changeable\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nThe MIMEtype is static and not changeable from `application/octet-stream`\r\n\r\n## PSVersion\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Workaround\r\nThis is just for users that are having the same issue and come across this. In the meantime I am using cURL in PowerShell for API's that require the MIMEtype change. Just change the type after the file to what is needed:\r\n\r\n`--form \"file=@C:\\Users\\Path\\MyFile.pdf;type=application/pdf\"`\r\n\r\nAs a side note the built-in cURL on Windows 10 is still on v7.55. There have been many [bugfixes and vulnerabilities](https://curl.se/docs/releases.html) fixed since then (It's on v7.75 now). I would install the latest cURL version and then update your system PATH for the latest version.\r\n\r\nThank you for your consideration\r\n",
