      "body": "Oof this gets more serious. Because PowerShell inherits `PSMODULEPATH` this bug does not manifest if you run PowerShell from PowerShell (like CI does via Start-PSPester). This only reproduces if you run it directly with a clean environment, in which case the modules manifests from the build are used, and the cmdlets are missing.\n",
