  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nPowershell currently defaults to the console output encoding when running a native command. ([NativeCommandProcessor.cs:1330](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/186d6be47d858460a3d0ba6abd81f779cb633b55/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/NativeCommandProcessor.cs#L1330)). This is the right default for most programs, but some software chooses to output a different encoding instead (Most commonly UTF-8). e.g. Rust programs, or programs that use [`activeCodePage`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sbscs/application-manifests#activeCodePage) in their manifest.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that there is no way to specify an alternate encoding using Powershell syntax. This leads to either having to temporarily change `[Console]::OutputEncoding`, or to run the process using the .NET `Process` class directly: [starship/src/init/starship.ps1:26-65](https://github.com/starship/starship/blob/e6a921b5b2a54ffd81368f9b3a573e49b5af1c9a/src/init/starship.ps1#L26-L65).\r\n\r\nIt would help if there was a builtin way to do this concisely.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nEither a parameter to some cmdlet (`Start-Process`? Not sure if that one allows reading output, not to a file, though... ) that allows setting the `StandardOutputEncoding`). Or some new syntax for it, such as a special cast.",
