  "body": "If you launch PowerShell Core via its exe Windows PowerShell then the window icon is still the old blue one in the window (but the taskbar icon is the new black one of PR #4848). This also affect the proposed context menu in issue #5012.\r\nEDIT: I believe this is an issue with the exe itself because when double clicking on the exe `C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0-beta.7\\powershell.exe` itself the new icon does not get applied either.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nEither double click on `C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0-beta.7\\powershell.exe` or execute in Windows PowerShell:\r\n`Start-Process \"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0-beta.7\\powershell.exe\"`\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe icon in the window and taskbar should both be the new black ones.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe icon in the window is the old blue icon but the taskbar icon is the new black one.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-beta.7\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-beta.7-84-gee902a649e0b803b3db4619f7eeeadea5e60d0e6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.15063\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT  I manually tried `.\\rcedit-x64.exe \"path-to-powershell.exe\" --set-icon \"path-to-black-icon\"` and although it changes the icon that is displayed in explorer.exe, it did not change the icon of the window when launching `PowerShell`. However when pointing `rcedit` to a HelloWorld .Net Core 2.0 console app exe, it worked (i.e. the icon also got applied to the Window icon). This suggest to me that somewhere in the Windows OS there is some registry key that overrides the icon for `powershell.exe`. Maybe this issue is a case for a rename to `psh.exe`? (JK)",
