  "body": "This is essentially a duplicate of closed issue [3663](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3663) which was marked as closed because while it failed in PowerShell 5.1 as the original poster commented, @SteveL-MSFT,  indicated this works in PowerShell 6. I can not get it to work in 6.0.4.\r\n\r\nI'm unclear as to why the required modules have to be installed locally before publishing. As part of the publishing process, a check is performed to ensure that the required modules are available on the repo. If the required modules are not available on the repo, the publishing of the module fails. If the required modules are found on the repo, the publishing of the module will succeed. With that workflow, why require them to be installed locally?\r\n \r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nNew-ModuleManifest m.psd1 -RequiredModules sub\r\nTest-ModuleManifest m.psd1 -verbose\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nI'd expect it to return details on the module being tested. For example: \r\n```powershell\r\nTest-ModuleManifest m.psd1 -Verbose\r\n\r\nModuleType Version    Name                                ExportedCommands\r\n---------- -------    ----                                ----------------\r\nManifest   0.0.1      m\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nI get an error \r\n```powershell\r\nTest-ModuleManifest m.psd1 -Verbose\r\nTest-ModuleManifest : The specified RequiredModules entry 'sub' in the module manifest 'C:\\Inbox\\m.psd1' is invalid.

Test-ModuleManifest should have an opt-in for checking just the manifest for being well-formed\r\n\r\nIf Test-ModuleManifest is updated to have an opt-in, would Publish-Module be updated to check the manifests with that opt-in?

      "body": "If you're like me and you've come across this page while searching for a solution to publishing modules from a container (Bitbucket/Azure DevOps) I have a very simple work around to this issue.  \r\n\r\n# Problem\r\nThe problem is that Publish-Module runs Test-ModuleManifest which expects any requiredModules (which will include Externally Required modules) to be installed on the local file system.  This is especially challenging when your module depends on modules from multiple external repos.\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\nThe thing is that Test-ModuleManifest just looks for the existence of the .psd1 file and doesn't care about the contents.  I was able to work around this by simply identifying the location where modules are installed by default and then creating the module directory and an empty .psd1 file like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFunction Build-RequiredModuleFiles {\r\n\r\n  # Get .psd1 data\r\n  $Data = Import-PowerShellDataFile .\\*.psd1\r\n\r\n  # Get the RequiredModules\r\n  [array]$RequiredModules = $data.RequiredModules\r\n\r\n  \r\n  If ($RequiredModules) {\r\n\r\n    Set-Location '/root/.local/share/powershell/Modules'\r\n\r\n    # Create the required module manifests\r\n    ForEach ($module in $requiredModules) {\r\n      $moduleName = $module.ModuleName\r\n      New-Item $moduleName -type Directory\r\n      Write-Output \"Creating empty .psd1 file for module $modulename at $((Get-Location).Path)\\$moduleName\\$moduleName.psd1\"\r\n\r\n      # Create manifest\r\n      New-Item \".\\$moduleName\\$moduleName.psd1\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```",

To be clear I have no control over that, but I think one of the major issues is that it would mark a significant change in behaviour in what's supposed to be a stable product version. Explaining to people that their module does or doesn't load because of a Windows patch would be a nightmare (we already see things like that and it's certainly hard to debug and often harder to explain).",
