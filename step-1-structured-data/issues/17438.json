  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nAs a user, I would expect Get-Command to mirror command discovery; if I can invoke a command (e.g., `uptime`) then I should be able to find the command pwsh is invoking with Get-Command.\r\n\r\nHowever, `Get-Command uptime` returns no results, despite simply calling `uptime` ending up finding and calling `Get-Uptime`.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nGet-Command should implement the same fallback behaviour used in command discovery; if no results are found and the command contains no verb, the `Get-` verb should be prepended to try to find the command in the same way command discovery normally would find the command.",

So shouldn't `Get-Command` get `Get-Command` for command ? \r\n\r\n",
