  "body": "It is not currently possible to update CoreCLR as they are removing SecureString, which means that Process.Start   is changing, which breaks PowerShell. Mike Richmond is getting us in the loop for when CorePS gets updated to support the CoreCLR updates.  We need to find out from CorePS how they get CoreCLR, and so which version they're using. If it contains our patch, upgrade directly. Otherwise ask for them to update.  I've pulled in the Linux equivalent of the ProjectK runtime assemblies that CorePS just updated to, located here  And the exact reference assemblies they're using   Going to meet with Wes from CoreCLR soon to get better insights into how this all ties together. ProjectK is essentially the TFS superset of the GitHub hosted CoreCLR. We would prefer to use the latter but the CorePS team uses the former, and we can't afford to continue to try nightlies.  Also, there's a DNVM  DotNet Version Manager  now available for Windows, Linux, and OS X. Dongbo and are looking into switching to it.  I'm currently blocked on updating the custom Makefile used to generate the CorePSTypeCatalog. I'm hoping a clean build of PowerShell on Windows will give me the generated file that I need, as the sources indicate it is clearly generated. Also waiting to hear from Dongbo about this. Failing that, I'll contact Peter.  The custom Makefile thing was solved.  Currently blocked on mismatched assemblies and references. Learning how to build them ourselves so we can get a matching set.  VSO create date - 8/28/2015 11:25:00     VSO closed date - 10/7/2015 11:12:00     \n",
