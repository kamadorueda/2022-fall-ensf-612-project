  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nI am requesting the PowerShell team begin publishing the SHA512 hashes for downloads of the PowerShell Core releases on GitHub.\r\n\r\nThis would solve the problem of verifying file integrity to better ensure the download has not been tampered with.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThe technical implementation of this would probably require the PowerShell team to create an automated PowerShell script to produce the hashes for each release, then upstream those hashes to the appropriate HTML tables on GitHub.\r\n\r\nProducing the hashes can be done using PowerShell's `Get-FileHash` cmdlet.\r\n\r\nThe GitHub download page should then either publish the hash for each release openly as a displayed string (it's quite long) or link to a file which contains the hashes for each release.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n>  Supported Platform | Downloads (stable) | Downloads (preview) | Hash | How to Install\r\n\r\nWhen a user downloads a PowerShell release, they can then verify the hash against the GitHub published version using the same cmdlet.",

Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nYes, you're missing something. The request is to publish hashes, any hashes. Currently there are no hashes available for the release downloads on GitHub. Unless you know where they are.",
