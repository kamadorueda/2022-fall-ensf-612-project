  "body": "Hi all, again. :-)\r\n\r\nSorry for the mail out of the blue.\r\n\r\nWe recently switched our beefy appliances (40 logical processors, NVMe, 128GiB RAM) from COSINE build 5B to 6B -- we are on a private branch, so the issue might be limited to us: RS5_RELEASE_SVC_ASDB_PROD1?\r\n\r\nAnd now running the following command takes over two seconds just to launch an empty powershell:\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Administrator> (measure-command { powershell.exe -command \"&{12}\" }).totalseconds\r\n2.2435018\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Administrator> (measure-command { powershell.exe -command \"&{12}\" }).totalseconds\r\n2.2792461\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Administrator> (measure-command { powershell.exe -command \"&{12}\" }).totalseconds\r\n2.2730729\r\n\r\nOlder builds were 10x faster:\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Administrator> (measure-command { powershell.exe -command \"&{12}\" }).totalseconds\r\n0.1868931\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Administrator> (measure-command { powershell.exe -command \"&{12}\" }).totalseconds\r\n0.2052852\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Administrator> (measure-command { powershell.exe -command \"&{12}\" }).totalseconds\r\n0.1922806\r\n\r\nOur current OS build is:\r\n\r\n$Script:Rs5SvcBaseDevBinaryImageBranch = \"RS5_RELEASE_SVC_ASDB_PROD1\"\r\n$Script:Rs5SvcBaseDevBinaryImageBuild = \"17763.10153.200514-1750\"\r\n\r\nYou can remote powershell into this system (e-mail richardt) and try it for yourself.\r\n\r\nWould you have any suggestion how to track this?\r\n\r\nI've taken precise xperf traces, but nothing has jumped out at me -- trace is here: \"\\\\redmond\\wsscfs\\Foundata\\vpetter\\logs\\richardt\\profile.cswitch2.etl\"\r\n\r\nThe whole system is just idle, waiting.\r\n\r\nIf it is a clue, setting parent powershell affinity to one core makes the time almost double -- and still, the whole system is idle.\r\n\r\n-- Rich\r\n",
