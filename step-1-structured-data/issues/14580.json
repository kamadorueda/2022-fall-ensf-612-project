What's worse, is that calling the higher level module will remove the classes and enums if they were previously added manually by calling ````using module ./bin/class.psm1````.  Once removed they cannot be added again unless the session is terminated and a new session created.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Darwin 18.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.7.0: Tue Nov 10 00:07:31 PST 2020; root:xnu-4903.278.51~1/RELEASE_X8\u2026\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
