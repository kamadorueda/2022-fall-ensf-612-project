      "body": "PowerShell 7 should have no bearing in Windows PowerShell (powershell.exe). They are separate installs and don\u2019t really touch any others settings. If you are having troubles starting powershell.exe from a scheduled task just try running the same action through cmd and see what problems may appear for debugging. Unfortunately without more information there\u2019s not much we can do to help.",
