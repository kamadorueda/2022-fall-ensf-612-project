When we get FileAttributes, we get a FileNotFoundException.  Even if I catch the exception, GetChildItem shows no information for this symbolic link because the FileSystemInfo has no data on the mode, file creation time, length, etc. for this file.\n\nInstead of trying to work around the problem, I've filed an issue against CoreCLR:  issue https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/3366\n",
