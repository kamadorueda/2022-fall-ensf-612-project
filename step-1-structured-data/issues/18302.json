  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nThere's a lot of boiler plate in experimental features, it'd be nice to have a source generator which takes this code:\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: Of course this would only benefit folks working on this repo specifically, but it would greatly simplify adding experimental features in the engine and leave less room for typos/missed files.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic partial class ExperimentalFeature\r\n{\r\n                          // Probably default to this\r\n    [Experiment(Targets = ExperimentTarget.Windows | ExperimentTarget.Linux)]\r\n    private static readonly ExperimentalFeature PSDoSomething = new ExperimentalFeature(\r\n        nameof(PSDoSomething),\r\n        \"The description for the feature\");\r\n\r\n    [Experiment(Targets = ExperimentTarget.Linux)]\r\n    private static readonly ExperimentalFeature PSDoSomething2 = new ExperimentalFeature(\r\n        nameof(PSDoSomething2),\r\n        \"The description for the feature\");\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand have it generate:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic partial class ExperimentalFeature\r\n{\r\n    internal static bool IsPSDoSomethingEnabled => EnabledExperimentalFeatureNames.Contains(nameof(PSDoSomething));\r\n\r\n    \r\n    internal static bool IsPSDoSomething2Enabled => EnabledExperimentalFeatureNames.Contains(nameof(PSDoSomething2));\r\n\r\n\t// Replacing the manual bit currently in the static ctor\r\n    private static ExperimentalFeature[] CreateFeatureList()\r\n    \t=> new[]\r\n        {\r\n            PSDoSomething,\r\n            PSDoSomething2,\r\n        };\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n```json\r\n// experimental-feature-linux.json\r\n[\r\n    \"PSDoSomething\",\r\n    \"PSDoSomething2\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n```json\r\n// experimental-feature-windows.json\r\n[\r\n    \"PSDoSomething\",\r\n]\r\n```\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
