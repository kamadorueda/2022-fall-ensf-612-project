  "body": "Fix the default path for finding the code coverage build to use `win7-x64` rather than `win10-x64`\r\nMove the test results files to `$HOME/Documents` rather than `$PWD` which will remove the annoying `git status` showing these two files after getting code coverage. \r\nChange the default path for the coverage file for `Get-CodeCoverage` to be the location that `Invoke-OpenCover` uses.\r\nChange the file coverage tool to take output from the GetFileCoverage Method. The earlier process was way to hard. Now you can type:\r\n```powershell\r\n$CodeCoverage = Get-CodeCoverage\r\n$CodeCoverage.GetFileCoverage(\"Program.cs\") | Format-FileCoverage\r\n```\r\nand see the lines covered and missed in any file named `Program.cs`\r\nYou can now compare coverage for a file between two runs with Compare-FileCoverage\r\n```powershell\r\nPS# compare-filecoverage $old $new program.cs\r\n\r\nFileName   ReferenceCoverage DifferenceCoverage CoverageDelta\r\n--------   ----------------- ------------------ -------------\r\nProgram.cs 100.00            100.00             0.00\r\n```",
