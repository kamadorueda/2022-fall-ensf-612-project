  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user I want `Copy-Item` to be able to skip existing files, so that I can copy only the non-existent files.\r\n\r\nFor example, I have a folder that might already contain some configuration overrides, and if they are there, I don't want to touch them, but I do want to copy any non-overriden configuration files.\r\n\r\nThis proposal does not require time checks, though it would make sense to implement it in a way that would allow time checks later on.\r\n\r\n`robocopy` is not a great solution since:\r\n1. It's not cross-platform\r\n2. It has high learning curve\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nCopy-Item --Skip Existing # allows for extensions like --Skip Newer later on\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nCopy-Item --SkipExisting # solves the problem, but not extensible\r\n```",
