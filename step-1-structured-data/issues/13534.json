  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently PowerShell does already show update notifications. Seen this on Windows Terminal, might also apply in classic Windows console (not tested)\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n**Option 1 (as-is)**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45657752/91501820-c08f3200-e8c6-11ea-95e8-ba489fffc1c4.png)\r\n\r\n**Option 2 (might feel intrusive)**\r\nToast notification for updates\r\nhttps://gist.github.com/dend/5ae8a70678e3a35d02ecd39c12f99110\r\n\r\n**Option 3 (might feel most intrusive, easy UX for non devs)**\r\nUpdater \r\n- refer implementation of PowerToys, I find theirs pretty good. \r\n- Checking for updates\r\n- update notifcation, uninstall, install and progress notification\r\n- improvements over PowerToys: uninstall / install could be silent as it is MSI, but they do not use silent switch for MSI atm\r\n\r\nthings that should be adjustable\r\n - update settings (automatic, manual, defer)\r\n -  target version\r\n - minimum version\r\n - channel (release, preview)\r\n\r\nswitches via registry (better ADMX and Intune Policies) similar to Windows / Office implementation.\r\n\r\n**Option 4**\r\nwhen conditions are met (Windows, appropriate version), offer winget to install / upgrade\r\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli/issues/120\r\n",
