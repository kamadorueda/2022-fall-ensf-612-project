  "body": "I'd like to try to get PowerShell Core working on Alpine Linux, with the long term goal of being able to run lightweight PowerShell Core Docker containers. The Docker container images I built using Ubuntu 16 and CentOS 7 are a bit on the large side.\n\nSo far, we know the following:\n- .NET Core is included with the PowerShell Core distributions\n- .NET Core has a dependency on `libicu52` and `libunwind8`\n\nWhat we need to figure out:\n- How to install or compile `libicu52` on Alpine Linux\n- How to install or compile `libunwind8` on Alpine Linux\n- How to install or compile PowerShell Core binaries on Alpine Linux\n\nAnyone want to provide some insight to this effort?\n\nCheers,\n**Trevor Sullivan**\nDocker Captain\nMicrosoft MVP: Cloud & Data Center Management\nhttps://trevorsullivan.net\nhttps://twitter.com/pcgeek86\n",

      "body": "We ported couple of libraries along the way such as lldb, then @benpye did the libunwind and @mjeanson blessed us with liblttng-ust on Alpine Linux via aports packaging system. I also made some strides on the xbps front (package manager for Void Linux, which ships with two variants: musl-libc and glibc) and requested those fellas to add couple of related patches and libs to unblock CoreCLR build. As a result, CoreCLR up until very recently, was building on Alpine Linux as well as Void Linux (musl) and passing all the \"PAL tests\". Due to a recent change in CoreCLR code base, there is a blocker I am hitting https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/917#issuecomment-236907708 and hence the progress has been scrambled. Hopefully it won't stay like that for very long.\n",

      "body": "So, I talked with the .NET team, and discovered that there's a `microsoft/dotnet:core` image that's only 250 MB. By inspecting the `Dockerfile` for .NET Core dependencies, I was able to produce a smaller Docker image for PowerShell Core, than what was possible with Ubuntu and CentOS 7. I used the `Dockerfile` statements from the .NET Core dependencies base image, and extended it to include PowerShell Core from a local build context. That avoided the need to install `curl` or `wget` along with extra dependencies.\n\nNow, the Docker image based on Debian Jessie is only **334.3 MB**.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/pcgeek86/status/769239625047035904\nhttps://hub.docker.com/r/trevorsullivan/powershell/\n\n```\nPS C:\\Users\\TrevorSullivan\\PowerShellCore> docker images trevorsullivan/powershell\nREPOSITORY                  TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE\ntrevorsullivan/powershell   jessie              4abfcbcdfcf8        16 minutes ago      334.3 MB\ntrevorsullivan/powershell   centos7             6d7da3eb764b        7 days ago          571.5 MB\ntrevorsullivan/powershell   latest              3cbb7892a31c        8 days ago          537.1 MB\n```\n\nIt's still not as small as we could get with Alpine Linux, but it's a huge improvement.\n",
