  "body": "Is it possible or at least planned to support SSH agent forwarding?\r\n\r\nI would like to login via \"ssh -A <host>\" from my Linux host into a Windows guest,\r\nand have a working ssh-agent in the same way as it works with Linux guests,\r\nso that I can use git to checkout code.\r\nCurrently this does not work, at least not as I know it from the Linux world.\r\n\r\nIf I start ssh-agent.exe there is no output like on Linux with SSH_AUTH_SOCK,\r\nbut it seems to run. At least \"ssh-add -L\" works and shows that there are no identities.\r\n\r\nThen I log into the Windows guest from Linux using \"ssh -A <ip>\". This works without errors,\r\nbut \"ssh-add -L\"  still shows nothing.\r\n\r\nI know that a Linux socket is not of much help in the Windows world, so I wonder if this can works at all. \r\n",
