If you are having issues debugging you should file issues in \r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell. VS Code can be bit overwhelming at first coming from ISE but if you stick with it you will eventually never look back or when your forced to use ISE you will feel like your back using flip phone. ",
