      "body": "That sounds like a breaking change from the RC1 release. Where was this documented?\r\n\r\nIt is my understanding that a framework-dependent app can still produce a platform-specific executable. The fact that the package is called PowerShell-7.2.0-**win**-fxdependent.zip certainly leads people to believe that this is meant for Windows only. I'd argue that if a truly cross-platform package is needed it should be published separately under a different name. \r\n\r\nSince PowerShell-7.2.0-win-fxdependentWinDesktop.zip will **never** be cross-platform since it depends on WinForms and WPF, can we please have pwsh.exe back? \r\n",
