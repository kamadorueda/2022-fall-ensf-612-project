  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nTypically, a user is only looking for the `[System.Xml.XmlNode]` instances that the XPath query matched rather than the _wrapper_ type instances that `[Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SelectXmlInfo]` provide metadata and require access to their `.Node` property to access the wrapped `[System.Xml.XmlNode]` instance, which is both non-obvious and inconvenient.\r\n\r\n(Compare this to `Get-Content`'s behavior, which doesn't _wrap_ the lines it returns, but merely _decorates_ them with ETS instance properties.)\r\n\r\n**A `-Raw` switch could be implemented that returns the matching `[System.Xml.XmlNode]` instances directly, following the model of `Select-String`'s `-Raw` switch**:\r\n\r\nThus:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Wishful thinking: -Raw returns System.Xml.XmlNode instances directly.\r\nPS> Select-Xml -Raw -Content '<foo><bar>none</bar></foo>' -XPath '//foo'\r\n\r\nbar\r\n---\r\nnone\r\n```\r\n\r\nwould be the equivalent of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSelect-Xml -Content '<foo><bar>none</bar></foo>' -XPath '//foo' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Node\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I never liked `-Raw`, and proposed `-Bare` as the name for a switch that generally omits output-object _decorations_ or _wrappers_ - remember #7855?\r\n\r\nAs such, `-Bare` would have been appropriate for `Select-String` too, not because it returns _strings_ as such, but because the _unwrapped_ objects are being returned, which just so happen to be strings.\r\n\r\n(For `Get-Content`, the current `-Raw` switch should never have been named that, but my proposal to have it renamed was rejected - see #7715. What _would_ deserve the name `-Raw` / `-Bare` is a behavior yet to be implemented - see #7537)\r\n\r\nIt looks like we're stuck with `-Raw` as the name for the not-string-specific pattern described above, so I think it is the right name here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
