However, doing so makes it impossible to retrieve the plain-text password from the PSCredential.GetNetworkCredential() API. There are some Web APIs which may require a null or empty username. This PR changes the way the password is parsed from the Credential parameter such that a null or empty username will not impact conversion to plain-text.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nCloses #9017\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",

We fixed most of style issues. Now there are mainly documentation issues. Since we are generating XML documentation, we should fix such issues as well. We could create something like \"continues documentations\" so that the XML documentation transparently flows into Docs repo. Therefore, I never wanted to turn off doc issues in CodeFactor. (Although if we turn this off we will have very few reported issues)\r\nOn the other hand, Codacy also sometimes looks very strange. There are sometimes false positives.\r\nTogether they (CodeFActor and Codacy) would be good.",

I really don't understand why CodeFactor was removed if it motivated us to correct above 60000 (!) style issues and make all PRs style clean.",
