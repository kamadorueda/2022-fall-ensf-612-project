  "body": "The existing tests for `pwsh -settingsfile` in `ConsoleHost.Tests.ps1` use `Get/Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlets for verification. However, the ExecutionPolicy cmdlets are not supported on Unix platforms, so those tests are skipped after the changes in #6021. New tests need to be added to verify the `settingsfile` flag on Unix.",
