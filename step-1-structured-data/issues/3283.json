  "body": "Hi there\r\n\r\nI have two questions regarding WindowsPE (at the moment still 10240 based):\r\n\r\n1.) Is there a possibility to test the actual 6.0-Release under PE?\r\n     I found none, but this can be my mistake.\r\n2.) Are there some plans that the ISE can run under PE?\r\n\r\nTHX\r\n",
