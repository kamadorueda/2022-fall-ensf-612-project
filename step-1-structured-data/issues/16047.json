I _think_ the `ToArray()` at the end is necessary, as `SecureStringHelper.New` wants `byte[]`, and I don't think there's any implicit conversion from `Span<T>` to `T[]`.  Here's a revised version of my possible fix.  It does compile and works in cases similar to the ones shown in the issue description, for at least as many as 512 characters.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nusing (CryptoStream cs = new CryptoStream(ms, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read))\r\n{                \r\n    int totalBytesRead = 0;\r\n    var tempDecryptedData = new Span<byte>(ms.ToArray());\r\n    //\r\n    // decrypt the data\r\n    //\r\n    while (totalBytesRead < encryptedData.Length)\r\n    {\r\n        int bytesRead = cs.Read(tempDecryptedData.Slice(totalBytesRead));\r\n        if (bytesRead == 0) { break; }\r\n        totalBytesRead += bytesRead;\r\n    }\r\n    decryptedData = tempDecryptedData[0..totalBytesRead].ToArray();\r\n    \r\n    s = New(decryptedData);\r\n    Array.Clear(decryptedData);\r\n    tempDecryptedData.Clear();\r\n    \r\n    return s;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere seem to be some extraneous bytes at the end of `tempDecryptedData`; if the range isn't specified when converting to `byte[]`, the `SecureString` returned by the method winds up with a handful of extra bytes that, in the cases I tried, wound up getting interpreted as roughly three to five (seemingly) random non-Latin characters at the end of the intended string.  The characters were different each time I ran the same set of commands; I'm not sure if that's because the random key was different each time, or maybe some other factor.  Specifying the `[0..totalBytesRead]` range to be converted to `byte[]` appears to resolve the issue, but I mention it in case it points to some potential security issue or edge case that I wouldn't know to look for.",
