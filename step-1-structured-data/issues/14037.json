  "body": "Since PowerShell `v7.1.0` had a few release candidates and now released as stable, it would be cool to have the [global tool](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PowerShell/) updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, is there any documentation on how and when the global tool gets updated?  \r\n\r\nI just want to ask because \r\n - the last release [took some time too until it got published](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12964)\r\n - no preview or rc release got published recently\r\n\r\nThanks for your efforts and the great work!\r\n\r\n/cc @iSazonov, @adityapatwardhan",
