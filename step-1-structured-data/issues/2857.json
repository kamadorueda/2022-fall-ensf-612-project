  "body": "This file contained many occurrences of U+F0A7, a character from the designated Private Use Area, so its meaning is not defined and fonts can assign any symbol to that character. Since the person who originally wrote this file works at Microsoft, it seems reasonable to assume that he was using the Wingdings font, which has a bullet character at U+F0A7 according to [this source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3346962/mapping-between-wingdings-symbol-characters-and-their-unicode-equivalents) and [this source](https://gist.github.com/nicwolff/1484025). Thus, replacing these characters with the proper Unicode bullet (U+2022) seems the right way to fix this.",
