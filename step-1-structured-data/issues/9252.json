In other words, the system advertises that it supports SELinux, but is missing the userspace tools and/or policy bits to actually make it work.\r\n\r\nAFAIK Ubuntu enables AppArmor as a default (and only) MAC in their kernels, and the userspace is built with similar assumption. It looks to me that the 'mainline' kernel people grab from some random PPA is not ready to be used with such userspace.",
