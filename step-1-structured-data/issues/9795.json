      "body": "When you pin pwsh to the taskbar and run pwsh once, then that 'run as admin' context menu is specific to the location of the binary (after it is run once, the OS remembers and even if you replaced the binary with a binary at the same location that did not have the taskbar jumplist code, the taskbar jumplist menu will persist, but that's just Windows), therefore the feature still makes sense for side-by-side. I have always had the daily build and the RTM installation side by side on my machine without any problem. By looking at the OS version, the user is running a Windows Insider build of ` 20H1` (as far as I can tell, this is the code name for the fast ring of the 2020 release of Windows), therefore I imagine this to be an issue of this preview version of Windows that should be reported to the Windows Insider team because Windows seems to have broken back-compat of their API, by looking at the error message it might also be a .Net Core issue.\r\nIn the future, I will have a look if certain methods pop up in .Net Core 3 to simplify the code and delegate the responsibility more to helper methods in WPF (I think I will have to make one small PR to WPF though to add the 'admin' functionality as WPF can add only taskbar items but not make them run them as admin)",
