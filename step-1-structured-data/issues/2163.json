PowerShell for Windows uses WinRM, and this is what will be listening on your servers. PowerShell for OSX/Linux only ships with support for SSH at this time, but the PSRP implementation @andschwa referred to will provide the WinRM layer for OSX/Linux. That will be a glorious day indeed.\r\n\r\nThe current workaround appears to be installing OpenSSH (very alpha, v0.0.4.0) on your Windows server, so it's able to connect to your PowerShell client over ssh -- see here: https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH\r\n\r\n(Full disclosure, I have not tried this yet.)",
