Is this because side-by-side installs are possible? Wouldn't it be better to just have it called `PowerShell 6`? The dash makes it look a bit weird as well.",

      "body": "The reason why there is a folder is not only side by side but also that the folder can contain e.g. an x64 and x86 version. For 6.0 it is a known issue that the start menu will contain only either x64 or x86 but this has already been fixed for the upcoming version. But I think we can consider replacing the dash with a space (I removed the dash already from the short cut name itself already). It is good to include the full version because it makes it easy for non-technical people to figure out their exact version should a patch be required at some point (e.g. due to new security vulnerabilities in .Net Core).",

The fix would be on [this](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/assets/Product.wxs#L178) line to replace the `ProductSemanticVersionWithName` variable with `ProductSemanticVersionWithNameAndOptionalArchitecture`\r\nYou can simply push that fix to your branch and on the AppVeyor build you can download the artifacts to test your fix before submitting the PR.",
