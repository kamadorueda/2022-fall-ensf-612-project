It was only writing to the host.  \r\n\r\nI've updated Test-PSPesterResults to throw an error after it writes to the host.\r\n\r\nI've also added a switch to Start-PSPester which will inject a failing test and the [includeFailingTest] in travis.ps1 which will use this switch so we can verify that it works.",
