  "body": "Launched PWSH as administrator (from start menu entry - recently added) and ran several commands:\r\n$PSVersionTable\r\n$PSVersionTable | fl *\r\n$env:POWERSHELL_DISTRIBUTION_CHANNEL\r\n$env:PSModulePath\r\ngci 'C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\'\r\ngci 'C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7-preview\\'\r\ngci 'C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7-preview\\' -Filter *exe\r\nls C:\\Users\\\\$User\\AppData\\Roaming\\code\r\nsl C:\\Users\\\\$User\\AppData\\Roaming\\code\r\nls .\\User\\\\\r\nls C:\\Users\\\\$User\\scripts\\\r\nls C:\\Users\\\\$User\\scripts\\psscripts\\\r\nls C:\\Users\\\\$User\\scripts\\psscripts\\ -Directory\r\n\r\nAt some point during these commands I focused a different window (non-shell) and then re-focused the console. When I started typing commands, it would insert an @ symbol on the first keystroke instead of the chosen character (even if Shift or Enter was pressed). I was able to repeat this behavior inside of the problem console, but was unable to repeat the behavior in new consoles launched as Administrator and I did not see this behavior at all when launching without administrator privileges. The problem also did not appear when launching the shell inside of a VSCode session as administrator.\r\n\r\nDuring my commands, I did use tab completion for the $env: cmdlets by holding down the tab button cycling through all the iterations, and also did shift-tab to reverse the order. It seems super obscure, and I am not sure how to reproduce this behavior, but wanted to make you aware.\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-rc.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-rc.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0",
