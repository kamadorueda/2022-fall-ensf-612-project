  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAn option should be added as a preference variable to set the session to read-only. While this is set, nothing outside local variables can be modified. Examples would be deleting a file off the file system or changing a system setting.\r\n\r\nFeature is not meant to be a security feature, but to protect against accidents. Think of it as a \"prevent accidental deletion/modification\". As mentioned below, it adds another benefit to using official/built-in/proper functions.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThis would target built-in PS functions, but possibly 3rd party. It would utilize approved PS verbs. If you call a function with a verb that means to modify/delete (e.g. `Set-Content` vs `Get-Content`), it will throw an exception.\r\n",
