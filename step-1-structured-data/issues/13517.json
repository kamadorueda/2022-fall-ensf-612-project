Packages may provide \"front-end\" files intended to be placed in (by linking or copying) these   reserved directories by the local system administrator, but must function normally in the absence of these reserved directories.\n\n   |  Programs to be invoked by users must be located in the directory /opt/<package>/bin or under the /opt/<provider> hierarchy. If the package includes UNIX manual pages, they must be located in /opt/<package>/share/man or under the /opt/<provider> hierarchy, and the same substructure as /usr/share/man must be used.\n\n\nSince you're using /opt/microsoft already, the obvious place would be /opt/microsoft/share/man.\n\nHowever, it looks like you're packaging a lot of different versions of PS in the package, so there would be collisions on manpages from the variant versions.\n\n\n$ sudo apt-file list powershell | grep -i -e '\\.doc' -e '\\.pdf' -e '\\.rtf' -e '\\.txt'\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0/en-US/default.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0/sosdocsunix.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.1/en-US/default.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.1/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.1/sosdocsunix.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.2/en-US/default.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.2/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.2/sosdocsunix.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.3/en-US/default.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.3/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.3/sosdocsunix.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.4/en-US/default.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.4/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.4/sosdocsunix.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.5/en-US/default.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.5/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.5/sosdocsunix.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6/LICENSE.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6/Modules/PSReadLine/Changes.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6/Modules/PSReadLine/License.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6/Modules/PSReadLine/en-US/about_PSReadLine.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6/ThirdPartyNotices.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6/en-US/default.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/6/sosdocsunix.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/LICENSE.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/Modules/PSReadLine/Changes.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/Modules/PSReadLine/License.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/Modules/PSReadLine/en-US/about_PSReadLine.help.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/ThirdPartyNotices.txt\npowershell: /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/en-US/default.help.txt\n\n\nI'm gonna say, to me, it looks like:\n\n    /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/share/man\n\nmight be more appropriate  (but, whatever, in my mind, it should be in /opt/microsoft/....)\n\nI do, however see:\n(ins)sdowdy@carrotcake$ sudo apt-file list powershell | grep -v ' /opt/microsoft'\npowershell: /usr/bin/pwsh\npowershell: /usr/local/share/man/man1/pwsh.1.gz\npowershell: /usr/share/doc/powershell/changelog.gz\npowershell-lts: /usr/bin/pwsh\npowershell-lts: /usr/local/share/man/man1/pwsh.1.gz\n\n\nyou're also affecting standard paths\n\n(ins)sdowdy@carrotcake$ ls -l /usr/bin/pwsh\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 Jul 15 13:55 /usr/bin/pwsh -> /opt/microsoft/powershell/7/pwsh*\n\nso, yeah, everything should be in the FHS directories areas (/opt/microsoft).\n\nAnyway, that's up to y'all, i'm just mainly pointing out that i can't install the current packaging in my NFS readonly shared /usr/local/ environment (easily).\n\nthanks,\n--stephen\n\n\n",
