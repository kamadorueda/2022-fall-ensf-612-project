Get the following project: [PowerShellTest.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/4275863/PowerShellTest.zip)\r\n2. In program.cs, enter proper username, domain and password.\r\n3. Execute the program\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nThe AD server hostname is returned: \"AD33.aspect.local\" in my case.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nI'm getting the following error: \r\n`Unable to contact the server.

      "body": "I'm not particularly familiar with the approach here, but the symptom looks very similar to the classic [double-hop problem](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ps-remoting-second-hop?view=powershell-7) often encountered in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nBecause the Active Directory commands tend to reach out to a remote machine (typically the domain controller) as part of their normal routine, you can run into issues when trying to do things like this...\r\n\r\nEssentially, any process running under a specified credential cannot use that same credential implicitly when it reaches out to a secondary server. You have to explicitly supply that same credential in order to reuse it. In the case of Active Directory cmdlets, this is done by passing a PSCredential object to their `-Credential` parameter.\r\n\r\nI believe this restriction applies in all remoting and impersonation scenarios using typical Windows APIs, not just PowerShell.",
