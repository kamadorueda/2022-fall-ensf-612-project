They target completely different things.\r\n\r\n`$env:` is not a variable scope like `$script:` or `$global:`; it refers to a PSDrive which targets the Environment variable provider. Similarly, a variable named `$c:test.txt` would target the file contents of such a file on the C filesystem drive.",
