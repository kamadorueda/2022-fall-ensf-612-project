  "body": "This change enables docker images to be populated with latest powershell from Microsoft YUM/APT repos,\r\ninstead of pulling the release from GitHub.\r\n\r\nNow there is no need to update the image for every release. We only need to publish the package to MS Repo.\r\n\r\n(Note: This change does not include Fedora. I will update the Fedora dockerfile after https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1882 is taken care of)",
