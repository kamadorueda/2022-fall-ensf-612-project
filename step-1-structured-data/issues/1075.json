  "body": "This changes the target of the cmdlet-example binary PowerShell module to `netstandard1.3`, which produces an assembly that is loadable on every version of PowerShell.\n\nNote that the new test simply asserts that, once built, FullCLR PowerShell can import and use it. I have no way with the current CI system to send the Windows-built assembly to Linux to test if its compatible, but have verified this by hand.\n\n@fearthecowboy, I believe this covers your scenario. Can you confirm?\n\n@SteveL-MSFT I've heard questions asked about if this is doable, and at least for a trivial example, the answer is yes.\n",
