  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nWith PowerShell, you sometimes get objects which have properties that are actually an array of objects. The Threads and Modules Properties on System.Diagnostics.Process object. When Format-List/Format-Table formats these parameters, they only include up to a certain number of occurrences, by default 4. The number of enumerations shown is determined by the automatic variable $FormatEnumerationLimit. So if you want more, you just update that variable, typically in a $Profile.\r\n\r\nHere is the current behaviour:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> $FormatEnumerationLimit\r\n4\r\nPS> Get-Process | Select-Object -Property Name, Threads -First 4\r\n\r\nName                    Threads\r\n----                    -------\r\nAggregatorHost          {5240}\r\nApplicationFrameHost    {16968, 2848, 18728}\r\nAppVShNotify            {9164}\r\nAtom.SDK.WindowsService {4064, 4908, 4912, 19144\u2026}\r\n\r\nPS> $FormatEnumerationLimit = 1\r\nPS> Get-Process | Select-Object -Property Name, Threads -First 4\r\n\r\nName                    Threads\r\n----                    -------\r\nAggregatorHost          {5240}\r\nApplicationFrameHost    {16968\u2026}\r\nAppVShNotify            {9164}\r\nAtom.SDK.WindowsService {4064\u2026}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose adding a new parameter to both Format-List and Format-Table, -FormatEnumerationLimit which overrdes the value of $FormatEnumerationLimit, but just for this command. Like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> Get-Process | Select-Object -First 4 | Format-Table Name, Threads -FormatEnumerationLimit 2\r\n\r\nName                    Threads\r\n----                    -------\r\nAggregatorHost          {5240}\r\nApplicationFrameHost    {16968, 2848\u2026}\r\nAppVShNotify            {9164}\r\nAtom.SDK.WindowsService {4064, 4908\u2026}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n* Update each cmdlet with the extra parameter\r\n* Change the logic for handling enumeration limit by using the parameter value if it is specified.\r\n* Retain the default value and default variable handling.",

Just like you can, on a cmdlet by cmdlet basis, override ErrorAction (e.g. `-ErrorAction Stop`).\r\n\r\nRegarding your last point - I am pretty sure FormatEnumerationLimit was there from V1. I could be wrong. But whatever it was, enumeration on a cmdlet by cmdlet basis would be useful. I know it was this way in V2 in 2011 when I gave a [talk at the PowerShell Deep dive in Frankfurt](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-deep-dive-lineup). Later [Jeff Hicks posted an article about that talk](https://mcpmag.com/articles/2012/01/05/powershell-enum-limit.aspx).",

What's in the help definitely matches the current behaviour (items per column, no effect on number of columns)  I'm wondering now if that was ever true, or if Thomas needs to tell me off for not listening in class :-) \r\n\r\n@doctordns  yes a parameter would work, but I've been doing something this week where if I could customize it I would want all 10 items in one column, but a maximum of 2 or 3 items in another, hence the custom property idea.

In all my work-around that time delivered the same message. I apologise if I did not explain that clearly enough.\r\n\r\nI _hope_ we both agree that the ability to control the enumeration limit on a cmdlet by cmdlet basis would be a useful addition to PowerShell.  I prefer a simple parameter but like the addition of using a hash table with a new key.\r\n\r\nHaving a `-FormatEnumerationLimit` parameter would be easy for both the cmdlet developer and the user.

Any new switch for an existing cmdlet breaks things. Old scripts run on new PWSH (with relatively few exceptions)  but I've used things from PS 5 and found the customer's servers hadn't been upgraded from 4, I'm writing today in 7.2 and testing in 5 because it's Windows PowerShell only on these machines, so I can't use convertFrom-Secure string or the new operators etc. etc. \r\n\"Don't use X if you want the script to work down-level\" is OK advice.
