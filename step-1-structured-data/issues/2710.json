  "author": "PaulHigin",
  "body": "These changes implement the SSH remoting cmdlet parameter set changes as discussed in RFC 0010 and comments (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/1-Draft/RFC0010-SSH-Remoting-Cmdlets.md).  \r\n\r\nThese changes also include a fix that prevented built-in Windows PowerShell (FullCLR) from hosting a SSH remoting endpoint.  The issue was with the managed code entry point attempting to update the console font before knowing if PowerShell is being run in console or server mode.  SSH hosts PowerShell in server mode without a console handle and this was preventing PowerShell from starting as an endpoint.  Fix is to move the font update code to console start where it knows what mode is running.",
