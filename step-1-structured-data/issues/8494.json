You need to post at the Azure PowerShell repository at: https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell\r\n\r\nMake sure to provide all the information required to help troubleshoot the issue with the correct PowerShell and Azure Module version.\r\n\r\nOn December 18th, the new Azure module was released:\r\nAz Module version 1.0  - new AzureRM module (now called Az) available for both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-powershell-az-module-version-1/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=linkedin\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try this new module moving forward.\r\n\r\nInstead of using the New-AzureRmWebAppSSLBinding, try using:\r\nNew-AzWebAppSSLBinding \r\n\r\nThen, log any issue found in the proper repository.\r\n\r\nThanks for your contribution!\r\n\r\n",
