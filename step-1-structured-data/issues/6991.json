  "body": "For Windows PowerShell/PowerShell Core modules to have a clear cross-compatibility story, we need PowerShell Core to respect the `CompatiblePSEditions` field.\r\n\r\nThis means, for PowerShell Core:\r\n* `Get-Module -ListAvailable` lists only those modules on the module path that are Core compatible\r\n* `Import-Module` will only import a module that is Core compatible and throw an error otherwise\r\n* The absence of the `CompatiblePSEditions` field should imply a sane default. The current suggested default is `CompatiblePSEditions = @('Desktop')`, i.e. compatible with Windows PowerShell (since there is no such field in Windows PowerShell and modules written for it only would lack this field by default).",
