It is tested on PS 6.1.0-preview.2 \r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be related to #4252 and #4262, but this is more to address proper error handling than to actually implement the functionality.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIt throws different errors from the underlying system.\r\nOn Debian Stretch, it throws full 9 line xdg-open error stack.\r\n![screenshot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15923171/39673167-52fe39f8-5137-11e8-840e-4ae95eb774d2.png)\r\n\r\nOn Debian subsystem on Windows 10, it throws 'No such file or directory' whereas folder exists. If a folder is really not existing, it throws 'Cannot find path'\r\n![screenshot_2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15923171/39673171-67f01c0a-5137-11e8-8aff-1225d471288b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

In all 4 cases, the error is the same as the above. Though, I am not even sure if that's supported scenario (pwsh running under Linux, but with Windows GUI).",
