      "body": "I've been looking into it and the use of `strlen` seems appropriate in this case. From [MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strnlen-strnlen-s), \"strnlen is not a replacement for strlen; strnlen is intended to be used only to calculate the size of incoming untrusted data in a buffer of known size\u2014for example, a network packet\"\r\n\r\nIt is used twice within ...\\src\\powershell-native\\nativemsh\\CssMainEntry.cpp. One invocation of it calculates the length of a hardcoded string that is guaranteed to be null terminated. The other invocation calculates the length of a string passed in as a command-line argument. In the second instance, we do not know the length of the incoming string so it would introduce a bug to artificially guess the value.",
