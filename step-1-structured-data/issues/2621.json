  "body": "And also \tAdd `AssemblyVersion` attribute to 'GraphicalHost' and 'LocalAccounts' projects so that they are of version 3.0.0.0 (same as the inbox ones) and not affected by the version number defined in `project.json`.\r\n\r\nThis is part of the work to address #2354. After updating the version number in project.json files, the nuget packages we produce will be labelled with `6.0.0` instead of `1.0.0`.\r\n\r\nNo `AssemblyVersion` attribute is added to \"PackageManagement\" related projects because they probably will be pull out of powershell/powershell repository soon. /cc @jianyunt",
