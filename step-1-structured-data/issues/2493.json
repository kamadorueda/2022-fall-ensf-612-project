  "body": "Fixing issue #951 \n- Implemented Update-Help on Linux to use .zip files instead of .cab (as cabs decompression is not supported on OSX and Linux). However, on Windows Desktop and CoreCLR, we will continue to use cabs (for legacy reasons). \n- On Linux and OSX, save-help will download a .zip file and .helpinfo file while on Windows it downloads a .cab and a .helpinfo file.\n- Moved existing help tests to PowerShell\\test\\powershell\\engine\\Help\n- Moved test resources to PowerShell\\test\\powershell\\engine\\Help\\assets\n- Added tests for Update-Help -SourcePath\n- Added tests for Update-Help connecting to the download center\n- Added Save-Help for the PowerShell Core modules\n",
