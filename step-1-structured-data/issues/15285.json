  "body": "In PowerShell Editor Services, the debugger can pass us the path to a script and any arguments to use with it, like:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"script\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\me\\\\script.ps1\",\r\n    \"args\": [\r\n        \"-Param1\",\r\n        \"foo\",\r\n        \"-Param2\",\r\n        \"bar\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen in .NET, we need to pass those through to a `PowerShell` object to run the script.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we don't seem to have a way to provide a script path as a command and an array of arguments to bind to it.\r\n\r\nThe options I can see are `AddCommand(script)` and then us having to recreate the parameter binding algorithm to decide when to use `AddParameter(\"switch\")`, `AddParameter(\"parameter\", \"argument\")` and `AddArgument(\"arg\")`. This isn't possible in general though, since we must know which parameters are switch parameters on the script to do this correctly.\r\n\r\nSo then we're forced to use `AddScript` and use some string templating:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n$\"& '{scriptPath.Replace(\"'\", \"''\")}' {string.Join(\" \", args)}\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has some serious drawbacks:\r\n\r\n- Injection becomes a possibility\r\n- Some arguments need escaping and others don't. Parameters shouldn't be escaped, but we don't actually know what's a parameter or not (that's what parameter binding works out).\r\n- The actual command execution stack now has an extra script layer in it, which isn't a nice artefact when debugging\r\n\r\nIs there a better way? It would be nice if we could effectively array-splat from .NET.",

The raw [CLIXML message](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-psrp/2cf8cccb-63ab-404a-82df-caef0c41717a) that contains the pipeline commands/scripts looks somewhat like this\r\n\r\n```xml\r\n<Obj RefId=\"3\">\r\n  <MS>\r\n    <S N=\"Cmd\">script or command to run, IsScript states which of the 2 this is</S>\r\n    <B N=\"IsScript\">true</B>\r\n    <Nil N=\"UseLocalScope\"/>\r\n    <Obj N=\"MergeMyResult\" RefId=\"4\">some values here that don't matter to this issue</Obj>\r\n    <Obj N=\"MergeToResult\" RefId=\"5\" />\r\n    <Obj N=\"MergePreviousResults\" RefId=\"6\" />\r\n    <Obj N=\"MergeError\" RefId=\"7\" />\r\n    <Obj N=\"MergeWarning\" RefId=\"8\" />\r\n    <Obj N=\"MergeVerbose\" RefId=\"9\" />\r\n    <Obj N=\"MergeDebug\" RefId=\"10\" />\r\n    <Obj N=\"Args\" RefId=\"11\">\r\n      <TNRef RefId=\"0\"/>\r\n      <LST>\r\n        <!--This is an argument, i.e. no Name just a value-->\r\n        <Obj RefId=\"7b\">\r\n          <MS>\r\n            <Nil N=\"N\"/>\r\n            <S N=\"V\">argument value</S>\r\n          </MS>\r\n        </Obj>\r\n        <!--This is a parameter, i.e. Name with a value, switches just use a boolean value-->\r\n        <Obj RefId=\"7b\">\r\n          <MS>\r\n            <S N=\"N\">ParameterName</S>\r\n            <S N=\"V\">parameter value</S>\r\n          </MS>\r\n        </Obj>\r\n      </LST>\r\n    </Obj>\r\n  </MS>\r\n</Obj>\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo regardless of whether `.AddArgument()` or `.AddParameter()` is used the raw CLIXML message still needs to know whether it's a positional argument or parameter which as you've said cannot be gleamed without reading the parameter definition and becoming your own binder. This is why the proposed method would require one of the 2 things to happen to support remote invocations\r\n\r\n* An exception saying this only works for local stuff where it can utilise the builtin binder to determine whether it's a positional argument or parameter to build the internal info\r\n* An extension to the CLIXML that allows you to just pass in a raw list of values and the parsing happens on the remote side\r\n\r\nThe 2nd is a lot more useful and works in more situations but it would require further extensions to the remote spec which may not be feasible. It's definitely possible as the `CREATE_PIPELINE` message already has variable properties based on the PowerShell version (`MergeInformation` is v5+).",
