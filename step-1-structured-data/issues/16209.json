  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nBoth x64 and ARM64 powershells can now run side-by-side on windows 11 on ARM64.  To better differentiate one from the other, for example, when accessing different registry keys, or loading dlls of different architectures, it is recommended to have a processor architecture field in the $PSVersionTable. This way, the cmdlets don't need to issue Windows API calls to determine the architecture of the powershell process.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
