  "body": "## Update mapped compileFiles\n\nRemoved `CorePsPlatform.cs` from the build mapping so that I could perform\nit before merging.\n\nNote that SMA by default now builds with a bunch of tracing files for\nETW, which cannot be compiled on Linux and must be hand-removed from the\nwindows-build auto-generated compileFiles output.\n## Add packages required for updated sources\n\nCommands.Utility now needs Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp, which doesn't\nexplicitly target `dnxcore50`, so now Commands.Utility and the packages\nwhich depend on it now much `import` the Portable Windows framework.\nThis also required adding the aspnetvnext feed.\n\nSystem.Management.Automation now requires System.Diagnostics.StackTrace.\n## Bump monad and windows-build submodules\n\nSee [monad PR](https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-monad/pull/7) and [windows-build PR](https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-windows-build/pull/2).\n",
