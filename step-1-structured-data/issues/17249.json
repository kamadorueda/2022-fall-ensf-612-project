  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOS: Windows 10, Windows Server 2019\r\nPowerShell Version: 7.2.2, 7.2.3\r\n\r\nWhen outputting data to the clipboard, all color codes are captured as well.  This makes it really inconvenient to use the clipboard as the contents are now mangled.   These should be stripped when put in the clipboard as they have no use whatsoever as far as I can tell.  This is just a simple example of it happening as it happens even when formatting text to be sent in an email (first place I noticed it). \r\nAlso Out-String shouldn't be needed either, but that's another ticket (#16431).\r\n\r\n```\r\nGet-PSDrive | Where-Object Name -ne 'Temp' | Select-Object Name, root | Out-String | Set-Clipboard\r\n```\r\nThen paste it back to notepad, pwsh, Word, or any other app (or at least I haven't found one it looks decent on).\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nName     Root\r\n----     ----\r\nAlias    \r\nC        C:\\\r\nCert     \\\r\nD        D:\\\r\nEnv      \r\nFunction \r\nHKCU     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\r\nHKLM     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\r\nVariable \r\nWSMan\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n\u001b[32;1mName     Root\u001b[0m\r\n\u001b[32;1m----     ----\u001b[0m\r\nAlias    \r\nC        C:\\\r\nCert     \\\r\nD        D:\\\r\nEnv      \r\nFunction \r\nHKCU     HKEY_CURRENT_USER\r\nHKLM     HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\r\nVariable \r\nWSMan\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "In 7.2.1 the default for `$PSStyle.OutputRendering`  was changed from `host`  (which had a reported theoretical security issue) to `ansi`. \r\nAnsi sequences are now added to all table headers - even if you set the style to no coloring in a reset code is still sent -  \r\n and the change of default means they are not removed when output is sent to a file, to the clipboard etc, resulting in \"Ansi corrupted\" output.  There are multiple issues about different forms of this .\r\n\r\nAs I understand it @SteveL-MSFT  made a change to fix the \"security issue\" which went into 7.2.2 but as of 7.2.3 the default has not reverted, so PowerShell is still not sending clean data. The work round is to set \r\n`$PSStyle.OutputRendering = \"Host\"`    \r\nor    \r\n`$PSStyle.OutputRendering = \"PlainText\"`\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT   is there a plan to change the default back to host ? \r\n\r\n",
