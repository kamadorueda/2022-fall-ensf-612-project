  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI understand that Microsoft no longer supports older versions of PowerShell.\r\n\r\nMany of my modules try to accommodate older versions of PowerShell and while I no longer use v3 or v4 in prod, I would like to continue testing these versions and need a reliable source for WMF.\r\n\r\nConsidering that Microsoft provides various ways to redistribute Windows Updates including WSUS, SCCM, local repositories and even DVDs, I would like to create my own repository and add the older versions of WMF to a GitHub repo. This will ensure I have continued access to the files when performing tests and I will ensure that it is known that these are no longer officially supported by Microsoft.\r\n\r\nI believe the licensing allows for this but wanted to ask permission from the team.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nChrissy\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
