  "body": "One of the primary use cases for PowerShell on non-Windows systems will be for administering remote Windows systems, including Azure and Office 365 via New-PSSession.\r\n\r\nThe number of systems administrators that will be deploying and using PowerShell to administer their local macOS or Linux systems will likely be much lower than the number of administrators using PowerShell on their native host to connect to remote computers.\r\n\r\nCan we please have a test added to the suite of tests that you're currently running for each build to verify that PowerShell can connect to a remote system, such as Office 365 via New-PSSession.\r\n\r\nThis has worked on and off in the past in various releases and is currently broken as of v6.1.0-preview.3\r\n\r\nThe commands I am using are:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$UserCredential = Get-Credential\r\n$Session = New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid/ -Credential $UserCredential -Authentication  Basic -AllowRedirection\r\nImport-PSSession $Session\r\n```\r\n\r\nThank you.",
