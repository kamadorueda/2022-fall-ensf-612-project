  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n_Update for clarification_: **The gist of this proposal is to bring valuable filter functionality that currently only exists in the _in-memory_ `.Where()` array method to its _pipeline_ counterpart, `Where-Object`.**\r\n(Always using `.Where()` isn't an option with large input sets, because you'd have to collect all input in memory first.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [`.Where()` array method](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_Arrays#where), which is the in-memory equivalent of the pipeline-based `Where-Object` cmdlet, offers a number of additional features, such as the ability to optionally stop matching after the first match is found, which can be an important optimization technique, and the ability to output all objects that come before/after a matching one:\r\n\r\n`First` / `-First` example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# OK - very fast, because - despite the large input collection - processing stops after the first match.\r\n(1..1e6).Where({ $_ -eq 10 }, 'First')  # -> 10\r\n\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING: Add a -First switch (among several others - see below).\r\n1..1e6 | Where-Object { $_ -eq 10 } -First\r\n\r\n# Without it, ALL elements are processed - SLOW\r\n1..1e6 | Where-Object { $_ -eq 10 }\r\n\r\n# Current workaround is cumbersome.\r\n1..1e6  | Where-Object { $_ -eq 10 } | Select-Object -First 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n`SkipUntil` / `-SkipUntil` example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(1, 2, 42, 43).Where({ $_ -eq 42 }, 'SkipUntil') # -> 42, 43\r\n\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING: Add a -SkipUntil switch.\r\n1, 2, 42, 43 | Where-Object { $_ -eq 42 } -SkipUntil\r\n```\r\n\r\nBased on the current `.Where()` features, the following switches should be introduced with the same behavior, mirroring the [`WhereOperatorSelectionMode`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.whereoperatorselectionmode) enumeration values:\r\n\r\n`-First`, `-Last`, `-SkipUntil`, `-Until`, `-Split`\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n*  `-Split` partitions the input into two and returns two collections, so it would in effect require collecting all input in memory first before producing output, which would have to be clearly documented.\r\n\r\n* The `.Where()` method has an optional numeric parameter, `numberToReturn`, that modifies the operations, such as `2` with `First` returning the first _two_ matches; since we don't have a syntax for switches with _optional (non-Boolean) arguments_  for commands (see #12104), we have the following options:\r\n\r\n   * Option A: Simply omit this aspect of the functionality and invariably default to `1`, which is likely fine in the majority of cases; if a different number is needed, `Select-Object -First/-Last $n` can be piped to.\r\n\r\n   * Option B: Implement `-First` and `-Last not as _switches, but as `-First <int>` and `-Last <int>` ; the potential downside is that a number argument is then _mandatory_.\r\n\r\n   * Option C: Given that `numberToReturn` also modifies all other functionality - though there's likely less of a need for that -  implement a separate `-Count <int>` parameter, which in the absence of any of the switches would imply `-First`.\r\n\r\n* For these behaviors to be implemented efficiently, they have to stop the pipeline on demand, as `Select-Object` already does. However, the latter does so in a problematic fashion - not giving other cmdlets a chance to run their `End` blocks - which should be addressed (independently) as well: see #7930\r\n\r\n\r\n**On a meta note: You can skip the obsolete comments that follow and resume reading at [this comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13834#issuecomment-714686798).**",

Specifically \"than the I'm-dismissing-this-for-implementation-concerns-alone logic discussed above.\" is incredibly rude.  I'm no stranger to folks being rude on the internet and typically I don't say anything, but if you actually want to have productive discussions that's a sure fire way to kill that possibility.\r\n\r\n> My bafflement was about something different: It was about first saying \"let's do this\" and then seamlessly transitioning to \"good luck trying to do that!\", and considering that to be the end of the discussion.\r\n\r\nFolks are free to change their mind in a discussion.  The 32 already existing parameter sets were probably not at the top of his mind.  Also saying something \"is probably worth adding\" is not a promise to fight for the thing you want.\r\n\r\n> Again, having clarity on what _should be done_ even if it _currently cannot be done_ and to also _communicate it that way_ is important - it is an investment in a potentially better future.\r\n\r\nThis is your issue.  While it's certainly a nice bonus for folks to come up with an alternate solution to implement the thing **you** are asking for, it is not a requirement or even an expectation.\r\n\r\n> Notice how @KirkMunro was the first to bring up implementation concerns above, yet he commendably did _not_ use that to dismiss the proposal.\r\n\r\nI want to point out that at no point did I actually dismiss anything.  I proposed an alternate solution, and **you** dismissed it as irrelevant to the conversation completely.  For the majority of the discussion following that, I was mainly asserting that it did not belong in a different issue.\r\n\r\nMore than that though, I don't know why you find the idea of dismissing an implementation due to concerns of said implementation to be so horrible.  The benefit of a feature or change **always** has to out weigh the amount of effort and risk involved.\r\n\r\nI know this applies to you as well, but please keep in mind none of us are being paid to be here.  If someone chimes into a thread with an implementation concern, it's not fair for you to demand that they also debate you on the merits of the idea that they do not think is actionable.",

To me, \"I'm-dismissing-this-for-implementation-concerns-alone\" still seems like a condensed, but accurate summary of your comments. \r\nI'm not taking responsibility for this being \"incredibly rude\", but I'm sorry that your perception of it as such caused you distress - it wasn't my intent.\r\n\r\n> Folks are free to change their mind in a discussion.\r\n> not a promise to fight for the thing you want.\r\n\r\nAbsolutely, but that wasn't [my point](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13834#issuecomment-715917411) at all.\r\n\r\n> While it's certainly a nice bonus for folks to come up with an alternate solution \r\n\r\nThat's not what I was asking for, though it would indeed be nice.\r\n\r\n>  I proposed an alternate solution\r\n\r\nI've argued multiple times why your alternate solution isn't one (to recap again: you can't use it to implement the bulk of the functionality in this proposal - perhaps I should have led with that, but it seemed obvious to me), but there was no engagement on these points.\r\n\r\n> I don't know why you find the idea of dismissing an implementation due to concerns of said implementation to be so horrible\r\n\r\nI don't find it horrible either - it _may_ just be a fact of life, recognized as such _after an earnest investigation_ - but, again, not [my point](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13834#issuecomment-715917411).\r\n \r\n> If someone chimes into a thread with an implementation concern, it's not fair for you to demand that they also debate you on the merits of the idea that they do not think is actionable.\r\n\r\nWhat is fair is to _expect_ and _ask for_ - not demand - that implementation concerns be presented in a _constructive_ manner, and a flippant about-face to \"Good luck with that!\" doesn't qualify.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, it is fair to ask that the merits of the proposal be evaluated _separately_, because even if something cannot get implemented _now_, it's still valuable to have clarity on what _some day_ can be done, perhaps in a different context.\r\n\r\nAnd it is perfectly fine for someone to only contribute to the former, constructively, without wanting to engage in the latter (which some may consider wasted effort) - but that's not what happened here.\r\n\r\nA constructive discussion can be had that way, and those that agree that the proposal has merit can then [discuss the actual implementation concerns](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13834#issuecomment-715917411) to assess whether it can be done and, if so, with how much effort.\r\n\r\nIt's ultimately always a tradeoff, but it should be driven by clarity on the merits of the proposal. And only with an interest in the proposal is someone likely to expend energy _investigating_ the implementation challenges.\r\nConversely, using a lack of interest / objection to the proposal to make a categorical claim of infeasibility is unhelpful.\r\n\r\nOf course, the outcome may still be that implementation is currently not feasible, but that determination would be the result of a constructive collaborative process, not a foregone conclusion.\r\n",
