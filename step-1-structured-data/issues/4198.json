  "body": "This will keep the shell from exiting when running new-pssession (and tests which call it)\r\n\r\nAfter a build on RedHat, the publish directory needs links to some native libraries otherwise when some commands are run PowerShell will fail with a null reference exception. While this issue may exist on other platforms, this PR addresses the issue only on the RedHat variants. \r\n\r\nWhen we create packages we create these links on the RedHat variants, this change does the same thing in the publish directory.",
