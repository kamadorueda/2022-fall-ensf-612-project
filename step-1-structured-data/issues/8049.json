Basically, the current implementation is incredibly clunky.\r\n\r\nI'd very much like if we could simply include dynamicparam as *part of* the `param()` block, perhaps as a full script block expression in place of a the typical `[attributes()]$variable`\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam(\r\n    [switch]\r\n    $Param1,\r\n\r\n    [DynamicParameter] {\r\n        if ($Param1) { \r\n            [Parameter(Mandatory)]\r\n            $Param2 = { Default-Value }\r\n        }\r\n        else { \r\n            [Parameter()]\r\n            $Param3 = \"Default Value\"\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n\r\n    [switch]\r\n    $Param3\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo summarise &mdash; Idea, absolutely, needs some love. Implementation/Syntax? Could use some more thought.",

      "body": "Well, it's better than the \"standard\" implementations we usually see, but it's still very much an arcane syntax -- I don't think I've *ever* seen anyone talk about approaching it like that before.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, any parameter attributes that need script blocks cannot be used there, as classes prevent you from supplying script blocks to member attributes. So that rules out `[ValidateScript()]`, `[ArgumentCompleter()]` and I think a few others. I can think of a few ways to skirt those rules in this specific case, but I think the case can still be made that dynamicparam... leaves a *lot* to be desired, unfortunately. \ud83d\ude41 ",

There was always a strong desire for a declarative style, and whenever possible, improving on that instead of making dynamic parameters \"easier\".\r\n\r\nAs an example, parameter sets can get unwieldy in some cases. There were some discussions around \"mutual exclusion sets\" to make it easier to express things like \"one of a,b,c and one of d,e,f\". I don't recall any concrete proposals from those discussions, but it's an example of the strong desire to remain as declarative as possible.",
