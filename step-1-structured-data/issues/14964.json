  "body": "We really need a way to control PowerShell's **configuration** from **outside** a container.\r\n\r\nReally, PowerShell should obviously respect _ENVIRONMENT_ variables like `TERM=dumb` or [`NO_COLOR`](https://no-color.org/) that we can set globally, and which we can pass into a docker container.\r\n\r\nIt needs to be something I can set when I'm not calling PowerShell directly, and ideally which works with _existing_ containers, so I don't have to try to mount a system `profile.ps1` into **every different container** we use...\r\n\r\nRight now I have a docker container where PowerShell is being run with `-NonInteractive` but whenever there's an error it spews a bunch of `[96m` and `[91m` and so on... \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/192942/110272565-818a1980-7f98-11eb-8fa3-fd3b1950151a.png)\r\n\r\nWhile we're talking about it, I also want to turn off Progress output with an environment variable too, because the output in that screenshot is really weird.\r\n\r\nHaving to reach into a docker container and create a global profile to disable color isn't really a good solution.",

      "body": "ANSI is currently controlled based on whether `SupportsVirtualTerminal` is `true`.  Unfortunately, on UNIX, we always [return true](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/6d7fbed02bcd8d5a2997626a4bf6e2c0302c2fd4/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ConsoleHostUserInterface.cs#L65).  We should probably at least respect `TERM=dumb` to set `SupportsVirtualTerminal` to `false` (which affects more than just color) and `TERM=xterm-mono` to set `SupportsVirtualTerminal` to `true`, but `$PSStyle.Output='plaintext'`",
