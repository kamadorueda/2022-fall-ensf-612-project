  "body": "<!-- Anything that looks like this is a comment and can't be seen after the Pull Request is created. -->\r\n\r\n# PR Summary\r\nThis adds completion for the various parameters and their values for #requires statements.  \r\nFor example: `#requires -PSEdition Core -RunAsAdministrator`  \r\n\r\nThe following parameters are supported:\r\n\r\n- Version\r\n- Modules\r\n- PSEdition\r\n- RunAsAdministrator\r\n\r\nThe following parameters are not supported because they have been deprecated or don't work:\r\n\r\n- PSSnapin \r\n- ShellId \r\n- Assembly \r\n\r\nMost of the help text has been taken from the official docs but I took some creative liberties for the PSEditions text.  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how strict the completion should be.  \r\nCurrently it will prevent some basic mistakes like adding parameters after `RunAsAdministrator` but there's no special checks for randomly inserted characters so if for example you type: `#requires blabla -<Tab>` it will still complete to the next parameter.\r\n\r\n<!-- Summarize your PR between here and the checklist. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\nThe easier the requires statements are to use, the more likely it is that people will use them. The Modules parameter in particular is hard to use without looking up the documentation due to the hashtable keys you have to remember when specifying a version.\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
