You can look at using [PSWSMan](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWSMan/) which is a fork of the WSMan library and included TLS verification that is missing from the built in version. Note that you still need to specify `-SessionOption (New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACeck -SkipCNCheck)` in PowerShell but rest assured cert validation still happens. When PowerShell 7.2 is out those session options aren\u2019t mandatory anymore when you use this fork (they will actually disable the checks like on Windows) but older versions still require them to be set.",
