      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT I'm working on it, but it's not trivial. I can't seem to use native PowerShell jobs here due to issue #11968, so I've currently written tests to use ThreadJobs instead, but that module isn't in PowerShell core, so that's accounting for some failures. For some other failures that have to do with remoting, I'm trying to figure out how to get those working, and will have to look at other remoting tests that are working to see if I'm missing something there, but it's very challenging, much more than anticipated.",
