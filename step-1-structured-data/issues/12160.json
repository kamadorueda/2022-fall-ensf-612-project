      "body": "The hang is definitely worth investigating.\r\n\r\nPragmatically speaking, the problem only arises due to the _asynchronous_ call to `.Speak()`, and even though Windows PowerShell doesn't _hang_, the speech output _doesn't actually work_ - unless you make the call _synchronous_, simply by omitting the `1` argument: `$speechy.Speak($text)`\r\n\r\nYou can also avoid the hang if you explicitly release the COM component before exiting your script (though speech output still won't work): `[System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::ReleaseComObject($speechy)`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@Jawz84, .NET Core 3 added WinForms and WPF support (on Windows), so PowerShell 7 automatically supports it too.\r\n\r\n@Tragen, as an aside, I suggest using the PowerShell-idiomatic way of loading a well-known assembly (by simple name):\r\n`Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms`, rather than the declared-obsolete `[System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName` method.\r\n",
