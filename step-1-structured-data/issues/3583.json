  "body": "Begins to address #3439 \r\n\r\nThis first pass just deleted or changed language that is not accurate.\r\nIt still needs another pass where new known issues are added.\r\n\r\nAlso, I corrected the style of the document to use pure semantic line feeds. If that's no longer the right thing to do, I can go back and correct it, but I think it's what we agreed on. \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
