  "body": "This PR makes use of the [markdown-spellcheck](https://github.com/lukeapage/node-markdown-spellcheck) npm module to automatically spellcheck .md files.\n\nThe tool runs in non-interactive mode in CI builds. It can also be run locally in interactive mode, which is easier to use since it let us go through each detected spelling error and choose whether adding it to the ignore list (the \".spelling\" file) or replace the word with a custom input. To run in interactive mode, just remove the `--report` flag from the command as shown the .travis.yml, i.e.:\n\n```\nmdspell \"**\\*.md\" --ignore-numbers --ignore-acronyms\n```\n",
