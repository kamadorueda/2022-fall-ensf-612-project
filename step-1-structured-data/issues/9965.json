  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen invoking an application command, created process' arguments should be as they are passed to command on all platforms.  `PS > myapp '{\"a\": \"\\n\"}'` should result in `myapp`'s `argv[1]`'s value of `\"{\\\"a\\\": \\\"\\\\n\\\"}\"`, regardless of the platform.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change on Windows due to how `CreateProcess` handles `\"`.  #9964 will enable selective application of this change per module scope without breaking existing modules behavior.\r\n\r\nRelated #9968",
