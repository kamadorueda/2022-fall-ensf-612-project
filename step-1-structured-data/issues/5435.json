      "body": "@iSazonov since you added `Type 'help' for help` as part of the startup banner, it seems unnecessary to point users to `get-help` in any error message.  PowerShell does have a suggestion system that we should try to take advantage of in the future to provide more concise help on how to resolve issues (like if they type a parameter name wrong, we can do some matching and suggest what they meant which is different from this PR).\r\n\r\nFor this particular issue, I think the ideal error message would tell the user which parameters are mutually exclusive and can't be used together or if another parameter is required to resolve the parameter set.  I added a note to https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5175 which covers a new proposal on defining mutually exclusive parameters to have better error messages.\r\n\r\nFor this PR, I think it would be sufficient to update the error message to what @markekraus is proposing without the `get-help` mention on the end which is to generic.",
