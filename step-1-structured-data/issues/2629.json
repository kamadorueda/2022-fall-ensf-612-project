  "body": "People use Out-Null despite much faster alternatives:\r\n\r\n    $null = Do-Stuff\r\n    [void] = Do-Stuff\r\n    Do-Stuff > $null\r\n\r\nThis change makes Out-Null work in roughly the same say as the above.\r\n\r\nThe optimization is to detect that we're calling the built-in Out-Null\r\ncmdlet when invoking a pipeline from script (the change won't have any\r\neffect in the PowerShell api). If we detect Out-Null, we rewrite the\r\npipe to look similar to `Do-Stuff > $null`.",
