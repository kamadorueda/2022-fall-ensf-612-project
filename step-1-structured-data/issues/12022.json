Invoke-WebRequest against external and internal sites used, and bypassed, the proxy respectively.  It appears that Powershell 7 reads the IE browser settings, but does not honor the exception list.\r\n\r\nI do see the `-NoProxy` parameter works around this, but I'd rather not have to adjust scripts in this manner.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri 'https://internal.corp.local'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n(returned web response object)\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nInvoke-WebRequest: Unable to read data from the transport connection: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host..\r\n```\r\n... and a network capture shows the request hitting the proxy (which, due to our network and proxy configuration, won't work).\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",
