But I also don't think `-Raw` is appropriate as `MatchInfo` is concrete type, not a decorated object that can be cored (i.e. not a `PSObject` with note properties.) @iSazonovI I like `-AsString` since it's more informative and we do things like `-AsHashtable` elsewhere. And adding multiples aliases for no reason is undesirable - it's just more stuff to learn with no benefit.\r\n\r\nRegarding performance, I doubt _creating_ `MatchInfo` objects has much to do with `Select-String` performance. Again, it's a simple concrete type, not `NoteProperties` on a `PSObject` so the `Get-Content` analogy is not appropriate. Compared to the other operations in the cmdlet, I suspect that `MatchObject` construction would barely register. (Note: [This PR](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/7673) will help with overall performance.) In the issue linked above, it seems that the specific issue has to do with rendering the `MatchInfo` objects rather than creating them. ",

      "body": "@mklement0  Thanks for pointing out the link issue, it should be fixed now.\r\n\r\n> It sounds like you're saying that performance gain will primarily come from bypassing ETS properties rather than straight .NET-type wrappers.\r\n\r\nThere are no wrappers for `MatchInfo`, that is, no `PSObject` extended properties to bypass.  `MatchInfo` is the result type of `Select-String` just like `RegularExpressions.Match` is the result type of `[regex]::Match()`. The match object does contain the string, but it also contains all of the context information. \r\n\r\nIn terms of actual string matching performance, `Select-String` and (git's) `grep.exe` are not that far apart:\r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore (2:213) >  time { grep.exe try C:\\netpop\\WarAndPeace.txt} | % totalmilliseconds\r\n61.3222\r\nPSCore (2:214) >  time { sls try C:\\netpop\\WarAndPeace.txt} | % totalmilliseconds\r\n82.9409\r\n```\r\nHopefully @powercode 's changes will make them even closer. Where the performance diverges significantly is when you render the output to string:\r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore (2:215) >  time { grep.exe try C:\\netpop\\WarAndPeace.txt | out-string} | % totalmilliseconds\r\n66.2149\r\nPSCore (2:216) >  time { sls try C:\\netpop\\WarAndPeace.txt | out-string} | % totalmilliseconds\r\n330.4404\r\n```\r\nNow PowerShell is much slower. So speeding up rendering is the place to look for performance issues. In fact, only emitting the string does substantially \"improve\" performance, at the cost of losing all context information:\r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore (2:230) >  time { (sls try C:\\netpop\\WarAndPeace.txt).line | out-string} | % totalmilliseconds\r\n96.3773\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso note that rendering performance is only an issue if you have a lot of matches. \r\n\r\n> The primary reason for creating this issue was to forgo the wrappers around the matching lines, because just wanting the lines themselves is a common use case.\r\n\r\nWhich is certainly easy enough to accomplish now as shown above. It's not a use case I find especially compelling in PowerShell - if I simply want to filter strings I'll use the `-match` operator. I use `Select-String` when I want to know in which file and on what line the pattern is matched.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I wonder that we switched to discuss stripping escapes here but I should say I'd expect that it is formatting system area to do coloring. I think Unix utilities get the parameter (`--color`) because there are no objects there and user have to set the parameter explicitly in a last command of the pipe. (I found examples of coloring applications that parse the output of other apps/ bash commands and then make a colored output).\r\nIn contrast, we know the type of the outgoing object and can delegate the coloring to the formatting system.\r\nFrom this point of view, I do not see the need to filter escape sequences explicitly - by default formatting system must only mask them (escape escapes) so as not to break the formatting (and possibly have an option to bypass them(ex., if we get them from external app)).\r\n\r\nAs for Select-String, I want to try a couple of ideas in the next few weeks to reduce allocations. Ping me if I don't do it.",

      "body": "Thanks for being willing to tackle performance improvements, @iSazonov \r\n\r\nAs for stripping escape codes:\r\n\r\nSorry - that was a tangent that I started, based on what I now presume to be at least a partial misunderstanding of the comment by @lzybkr that you linked to.\r\n\r\nLet me try to close the tangent:\r\n\r\n> I think Unix utilities get the parameter (--color) because there are no objects there and user have to set the parameter explicitly in a last command of the pipe.\r\n\r\nNo, coloring is more typically applied via aliases (e.g., `alias ls='ls --color=auto'` on Linux) or environment variables, where supported (e.g., `export CLICOLOR` on macOS).\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, the expectation is that the _producers_ of optimized-for-display output (coloring, padding/multi-column output) suppress these optimizations _situationally_, namely if stdout isn't connected to a _terminal_ (unless keeping colors is explicitly requested); both `ls` and `grep` are examples of utilities that exhibit this behavior.\r\n\r\nYou're right that in PowerShell we typically don't have this problem, because PowerShell's output-formatting system does _not_ come into play:\r\n   * when piping objects to PowerShell-native commands, because the receiving commands process the objects as such.\r\n  * when piping objects to _external program_, because it is the `.ToString()` representation that is then used (and while that representation is often unhelpful, it is untroubled by issues of assuming a fixed window width or applying output coloring).\r\n\r\nHowever, problems do arise with `>`  / `Out-File`, where the default output formatting _is_ applied, and can cause problems:\r\n\r\n* Currently, only with respect to the assumed _max. line width_, as discussed in #4767\r\n\r\n* Potentially in the future also with respect to _colored output_; e.g., #3886\r\n\r\nThat is, `>` / `Out-File` should be enhanced to modify its behavior on whether output is going to a _terminal_ or a _file_ (analogous to Unix utilities - the smarts PowerShell currently lacks, as pointed out by @lzybkr) - in the latter case, either no max. line width should be assumed, or a reasonably high default value should be used, and coloring should be stripped, at least by default.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTherefore, the need for explicitly stripping escape codes on _receiving_ strings is definitely atypical, and as such `Remove-AnsiEscapeSequences` cmdlet and/or a `-StripAnsiCodes` switch for `Select-String` are definitely low-priority - albeit nice to have in principle (\"rogue\" utilities / scripts could be producing output with escape sequences _unconditionally_; that this does happen in practice is demonstrated by [this SO query](https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=strip+ansi+codes)).\r\n",
