(Win10 LongPathsEnabled is set to 1). Anyway.\r\n\r\nRemove-Item cannot delete a directory which was created by Net-Item, it reports that the path is \"too long\".\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\temp> # Create a Directory\r\nPS C:\\temp> $dirname = 'c:\\Temp\\123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345'\r\n\r\nPS C:\\temp> New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dirname\r\n    Directory: C:\\Temp\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd-----       25.05.2017     00:52                123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345\r\n\r\nPS C:\\temp> # Delete Directory\r\nPS C:\\temp> Remove-Item -Force -Recurse -Path $dirname\r\nRemove-Item : The specified path, file name, or both are too long.
