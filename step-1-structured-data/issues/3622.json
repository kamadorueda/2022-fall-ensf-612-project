  "body": "New-ModuleManifest was incorrectly checking if a Uri was well formed by using ToString() which just outputs the original\r\n\r\nstring.  If the string was a uri with spaces, ToString() doesn't return the escaped version.  The AbsoluteUri property\r\nshould be used instead which returns an escaped absolute uri (if valid).\r\n\r\nAlso renamed TestModuleManfest.ps1 to TestModuleManifest.Tests.ps1 so that it gets picked up correctly as Pester test.\r\n\r\nSince HelpInfoUri is just a string, ensure it is a valid absolute uri and escaped correctly whereas before it was just\r\nan opaque string that wasn't validated.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3336",
