  "body": "Since DCOM is not supported in corefx there was a great deal of dead code in the computer cmdlets.\r\nThis PR removes all vestiges of DCOM support from:\r\n\r\n- Rename-Computer\r\n- Restart-Computer\r\n- Stop-Computer\r\n\r\nremoving about 4500 lines of dead code. Also, tests are updated to provide more complete coverage.\r\nI also removed test-connection completely to make way for @iSazonov upcoming PR to improve coverage in tests, I created some test hook code which will test the cmdlet code without actually calling the WMI method to restart/rename/stop the system.\r\n\r\nthis is a replacement for PR 515",
