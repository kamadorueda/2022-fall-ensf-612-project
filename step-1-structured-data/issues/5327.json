Currently we can not build PowerShell Core 6.0 on Windows from VS Code until we install PowerShell Core 6.0 >=Beta.9 but can from command line. On Unix we have to install PowerShell Core 6.0 in any case because we deprecate install.sh. \r\nSo question is - Shall we continue support build PowerShell Core with Windows PowerShell or no? If we continue build from command line why we don't support to build from VS Code?",

I expect the significant majority of people building PSCore6 to be using the build.psm1 module.  The only time I ever build PSCore6 from VSCode is when debugging something.  ",
