  "body": "Today we have the [PowerShell Standard 5.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellStandard) Nuget package for binary modules that work on PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 6.x and later.\r\n\r\nWhat is the plan for binary modules that only work on PowerShell 7.0 and later, due to their dependencies on new public interfaces available only in that version? As part of the 7.0 preview process, are you going to build/publish a Microsoft.PowerShell.7.ReferenceAssemblies Nuget package? Or will there be a different successor to PowerShell Standard 5.1? And when will we start seeing such a package available as part of the 7.0 preview release process?",

Yeah, #10011 is the one. \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nIt was also brought up on Twitter, which is harder to search through, but @SteveL-MSFT mentioned they'd be getting some reference libraries put together for PS 6.x and PS7.
