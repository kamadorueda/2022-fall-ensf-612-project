  "body": "Rather than it being given an assembly to launch, I want it to automatically launch the appropriate assembly if given no arguments inline script file script, and ensure it works for hashbang as well. This would then deprecate all the runps scripts.  It would get us well on the way to packaging, as we'll have a simple `powershell` executable that acts like people would expect.  We should also look in smarter places for the environment variables, and move the PowerShell libraries to lib powershell, and coreclr libraries to lib coreclr ? .  The monad linux Makefile should then take a DESTDIR  or prefix  to place lib and bin correctly  note that CMake in monad native should be passed a flag instead of resolving up itself .
