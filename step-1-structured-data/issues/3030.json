The correct invocation would be:\r\n\r\n```Set-AdUser johndoe -HomeDrive H: -HomeDirectory \\\\file01\\home$\\johndoe```\r\n\r\nHowever, since Set-AdUser does not do any input validation, the caller is not alerted to this problem. Different windows components will show differnet info, ADUC will show it like it's correct while windows itself will just fall back to Z: for whatever reason.\r\n\r\nOne possible approach would be to simply put a ValidateRegex like \"^[A-Z]:$\" or something, another would be to tack on a : if it's missing, but that would cause scripts to fail on older versions of powershell if written against newer versions.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value                                                                                                                          \r\n----                           -----                                                                                                                          \r\nPSVersion                      5.0.10586.117                                                                                                                  \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                                        \r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.10586.117                                                                                                                 \r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.36373                                                                                                                \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                                            \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                                            \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                                                                                                        \r\n\r\n```\r\n",
