  "body": "If you have multiple copies of PSCore6 on your system, they all write to the same `ModuleAnalysisCache` file.  This can potentially produce unexpected results.  Modules in this cache are stored with absolute path, so if pwsh1 is in path $PSHOME1, then it will cache modules under $PSHOME1\\Modules.  When you then run pwsh2 in $PSHOME2, it can still find modules in $PSHOME1\\Modules since it's in the cache.  It seems that each \"install\" of PSCore6 should write to its own `ModuleAnalysisCache`.  Perhaps add a hash of the path to `pwsh` to the cache filename.",
