  "body": "Hello, colleagues, I've put all my \"troubleshooting\" steps into the bigger article, [here](https://eosfor.github.io/2018/Episode1-Issues-with-Argument-Completers/). In short what I've found is that when scriptblock is passed to  ```[ArgumentCompleter()]``` as a parameter, does not see functions local to a module.\r\n\r\nOr, maybe i do something wrong?\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nWhen ```[ArgumentCompleter()]``` \"runs\" a script block, it should attach it to a module \"local scope\".  I mean that it should see functions local to the module/script, because commonly I don't want to export \"completers\" out of a module\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nWhen ```[ArgumentCompleter()]``` \"calls\" a script block passed to it, scriptblock, looks like does not see internal functions of a module, but it seems to be able to see them if they are exported to a global scope.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n",

However, as i said in the post, option with providing [type] to the completer attribute works fine, perhaps because it is \"local\" to the function or something, i don't know. @iSazonov, you are in +2hrs from me ;), so we can talk and i can show you this live, if you want.",
