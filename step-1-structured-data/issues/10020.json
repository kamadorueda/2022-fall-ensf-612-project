  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nAt many places in the code base, PowerShell uses `WildcardPattern` for strings that don't really contain any wildcard characters. For example, `Import-Module` use `WildcardPattern` for entries of `ExposedFunctions`, `ExposedCmdlets`, `ExposedAlias` and etc. even if those entries contain no wildcard characters. In that case, `WildcardPattern.IsMatch` essentially should just do a string comparison, but we are go through the same code path that handles real wildcard patterns, while results in unnecessary cycles and allocations.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a fast path for `WildcardPattern.IsMatch(string)` for that case -- simply do a string comparison when the pattern string contains no special characters (wildcard characters `*`, `?`, `[`, `]` and the escape character backtick `).\r\n\r\nThe following is the the memory allocation when the module analysis is triggered.\r\nAs is shown, `int32[]` allocation drops drastically, and also the type `PatternPositionVisitor` is completely avoided.\r\nThis is because the pattern matching happens in module analysis (e.g. `ModuleIntrinsics.ExportModuleMembers`) are now going through the fast path.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/60305002-ffef7680-98ef-11e9-8b47-f33f8766202e.png)\r\n\r\nAlso, `WildcardPattern.IsMatch` is about 2x faster in steady state when the pattern string contains no wildcard characters:\r\n\r\n#### Before the change\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS:1> $p = [WildcardPattern]::new(\"abcdefghi\")\r\nPS:18> Measure-Command { foreach ($i in 1..100000) { $p.IsMatch(\"abc\") } }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 103\r\nTicks             : 1030111\r\nTotalDays         : 1.19225810185185E-06\r\nTotalHours        : 2.86141944444444E-05\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.00171685166666667\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.1030111\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 103.0111\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### After the change\r\n```\r\nPS:1> $p = [WildcardPattern]::new(\"abcdefghi\")\r\nPS:31> Measure-Command { foreach ($i in 1..100000) { $p.IsMatch(\"abc\") } }\r\n\r\nDays              : 0\r\nHours             : 0\r\nMinutes           : 0\r\nSeconds           : 0\r\nMilliseconds      : 59\r\nTicks             : 594633\r\nTotalDays         : 6.88232638888889E-07\r\nTotalHours        : 1.65175833333333E-05\r\nTotalMinutes      : 0.000991055\r\nTotalSeconds      : 0.0594633\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 59.4633\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",
