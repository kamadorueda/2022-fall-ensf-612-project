  "body": "1. The PR \"Allow Start-PSBuild -Output to take absolute path\"  #2398  broke debuging in Visual Studio Code. (Cannot find file powershell).\n\nI make revert the changes and the issue went away.\n1. Additionally, I had to change line \"/debug/\" to \"debug/\" in file .gitignore because many are not excluded files appear in the folder src\\powershell-win-core\\debug. \n   This problem also appeared only today but don't know the reason.\n\n@andschwa please take attention\n",
