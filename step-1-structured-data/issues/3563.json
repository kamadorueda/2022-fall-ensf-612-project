  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI first tried the Centos 7 RPM but executing the resulting powershell binary complained about GLIBCXX versions. Everything I've read suggests that trying to maintain multiple versions of glibc is a bad idea.\r\n\r\nSo I then tried the Linux AppImage which claimed to be self-contained and independent of the Linux distribution. This failed because of a missing dependency, libfuse.so.2. So...I did a local rpm install of the fuse libraries, retried PS, and got a different error, one that led me back to the need for a different glibc (please see \"Actual Behavior\" below).\r\n\r\nI sure would like to be able to run PS under Centos 6.8!\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n./PowerShell-6.0.0-alpha.18-x86_64.AppImage\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nEither a PowerShell prompt or some evidence that the binary works, e.g., a message.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n**error while loading shared libraries: libfuse.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory**\r\n\r\nThen installed the fuse libs via:\r\n\r\n**rpm -ivh fuse-libs-2.8.3-5.el6.x86_64.rpm**\r\n\r\nThen got this result:\r\n\r\n**/lib64/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.14' not found (required by /tmp/.mount_rwW5m7/usr/lib/libtinfo.so.5)**\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\nKernel: 2.6.32-642.11.1.el6.x86_64\r\nCentos: centos-release-6-8.el6.centos.12.3.x86_64\r\n\r\n",

Without support on their end, we also can't support anything prior to 7. \r\n\r\nI'd look at or participate in this issue: dotnet/coreclr#6792\r\n\r\nThere's some people there discussing that you might just need a new version of glibc (which would align with the error you see here).
