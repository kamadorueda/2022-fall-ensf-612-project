  "body": "Currently when a new runspace is created its default name is \"Runspace#\".  The only exception to this is the runspace created on a host process for IPC and it is named \"RemoteHost\".\n\nWe should provide runspace names with meaning when possible.  This would make it easier for users to determine which runspace in the list is the one they want to examine or debug.\n\nFor example:\n1. The first runspace created in a session with a PSHost should be named \"HostRunspace\" (now it is \"Runspace1\").\n2. The IPC host runspace should be renamed to \"IPCHostRS\".\n3. The runspace proxy created for a WinRM remote session should be \"WinRMRunspace#\".\n4. The runspace proxy created for an SSH remote session should be \"SSHRunspace#\".\n5. Internal runspaces created by the PowerShell engine could be something like \"InternalRS#\", or \"PSTempRS#\".\n6. Workflow runspaces could be \"PSWorkflowRS#\".\n",

PowerShell internally has many uses for non-default runspaces and it would be good to indicate that when debugging sessions with multiple runspaces.  Note that the original request for this came from a committee member (Jeffrey).  We already provide a runspace name that can be attached to a created runspace.  This is about providing meaningful names for PowerShell internally created runspaces.",
