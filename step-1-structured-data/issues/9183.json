  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWindows powershell and cmd have an option in the settings menu to set the terminal to translucent. This is very important to me to watch programming talks, podcasts, and star trek while I am coding. It also helps because when I am copying over a command from stack overflow or somesuch to powershell I can see the command in the other window.\r\n\r\nOn my copy of windows pro 10.0.17763 build 17763 the terminal does not remember the setting for translucency when I close and open my terminal. That means each time I log in I have to set my translucency manually.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nAdd a floating point number in storage that contains the last known percentage for transparency. This way when the terminal opens it checks this number and remembers what I had it set to, thus removing a step when I log in.\r\n",
