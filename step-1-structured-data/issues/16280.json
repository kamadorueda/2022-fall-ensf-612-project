      "body": "There are updates to 7.0.x and 7.1.x. And the daily build is updated as is, I think, the latest 7.2 preview.  I've had those for a couple of days. Whenever there's an updated version, I get the notification the next time I start PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThere is community awareness. I've seen tweets [pointing here.](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-asks-admins-to-patch-powershell-to-fix-wdac-bypass/) And [I've posted a blog entry](https://tfl09.blogspot.com/2021/10/patching-and-powershell-7.html) and a[ post over on Spiceworks](https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2336088-patchtime-for-powershell-7?page=1#entry-9303193). \r\n\r\nAlso, this is not a vulnerability in WIndows Powershell, so it's only relevant where you have installed PowerShell 7.x.\r\n",
