  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR removes the `SSHRemoting` and `install` folders within `demos`. I also removed `SSHRemoting` from an existing test, as well as the `.spelling` region for it. \r\n\r\nThese docs are now hosted on docs.microsoft.com:\r\n* [PowerShell Remoting Over SSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/core-powershell/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core?view=powershell-6)\r\n* [Installing PowerShell Core on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-6)\r\n* [Installing PowerShell Core on macOS and Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-macos-and-linux?view=powershell-6)\r\n\r\nWe may also want to delete `docs/installation` from PS/PS, but it's unclear to me yet if folks know to update the doc in PowerShell-Docs from here on out (and it may contain some installation info about installing a preview build that hasn't yet been merged into PowerShell-Docs). /cc @TravisEz13 \r\n\r\nIf I should delete that, I'll do it in a follow-up PR. Or if someone wants to push into my fork, that's cool too, I just didn't want to do it without a Maintainer giving input first. \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
