  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nWhen referencing a _regular_ variable with `$using:` its existence is _enforced_ (including when _scope_ specifiers such as `$script:` are used); that is, the non-existent of the referenced variable causes an error.\r\n\r\nHowever, when _namespace variable notation_ is used, non-existence is quietly ignored and the references evaluates to `$null`\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Error, due to referenced variable not existing \r\nStart-Job { $using:NOSUCHVARIABLE } | Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob\r\nStart-Job { $using:variable:NOSUCHVARIABLE } | Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob  # variable: drive is special; no existence check for *other* drives' items\r\n\r\n# Namespace variable notation (with a drive other than variable:)\r\n# Quietly ignored, evaluates to $null\r\nStart-Job { $using:env:NOSUCH } | Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob       # drive exists, item doesn't\r\nStart-Job { $using:NOSUCHDRIVE:foo } | Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob  # drive doesn't exist.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll four commands should report an error similar to `Start-Job: The value of the using variable '...' cannot be retrieved because it has not been set in the local session.`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nOnly the first two commands emit such an error, the latter two quietly pass `$null` to the job script block.\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 7.3.0-rc.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
