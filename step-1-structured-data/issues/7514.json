  "body": "Is there a reason that `New-Object` couldn't accept an actual data type instead of requiring a string representation of the data type?  Currently, when you instance an object with `New-Object`, you need to specify the type of the object with a string representation of the object.\r\n\r\n    $Uri = New-Object -TypeName 'System.Uri' -ArgumentList 'http://www.example.com/'\r\n\r\nThis works perfectly well, but something that I find that I do quite often is use data types directly to take advantage of code completion.  If I want an SqlConnection, for example, I type `[sqlconn`, hit tab for code completion, and PowerShell will automatically give me `[System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection]`.  I don't have to look up the namespace, and I can tab through the available types if I need to.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if you could just specify that datatype with `New-Object` because it makes it so easy to utilize that code completion, while the `-TypeName` parameter simply requires you to know the whole type or to use code completion with square brackets, and then go back, remove the square brackets, and change it into a string.  More frustrating, you can't easily use code completion at the command line this way.  If you want an SQL connection, you can't type `New-Object -TypeName [SqlConn` and hit tab.  Code completion won't work there because it thinks you're specifying a string parameter.\r\n\r\nImagine if I could just say:\r\n\r\n    New-Object -DataType [System.Uri] -ArgumentList 'http://www.example.com/'\r\n    New-Object -DataType [System.Data.SqlClient.SqlConnection] -ArgumentList $ConnectionString\r\n    New-Object -DataType [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[System.String]]\r\n\r\nWhere `-DataType` accepts objects objects of `System.RuntimeType`.\r\n\r\nOr, if I have an object in a variable and I want a new instance of the same type:\r\n\r\n    New-Object -DataType $Uri.GetType() -ArgumentList 'http://www.example.com/'\r\n\r\nGranted, you can do things like:\r\n\r\n    New-Object -TypeName ([System.Uri]).FullName -ArgumentList 'http://www.example.com/'\r\n    New-Object -TypeName $Uri.GetType().FullName -ArgumentList 'http://www.example.com/'\r\n\r\nSo perhaps it's not really a worthwhile change, but I have to say that I find it irritating every time I instance an object that it would really be much easier for me to just *specify the data type*, but I've got to supply a string instead.\r\n",

      "body": "@AikenBM  Be aware that you aren't actually passing a type literal when you do  `New-Object [some.type]`, you're passing in the _string_ `\"[some-type]\"`. This is because arguments are parsed in _argument_ mode where '[' is simply treated as being part of a string. If you wrap the type in parens, forcing _expression_ mode parsing as in\r\n```powershell\r\nNew-Object ([System.URI]) -argument http://example.com\r\n```\r\nthen you get what you expect. There have been requests in the past to allow the type conversion code for `string` to `Type` to also allow type name strings to include '[',']' so `[type] '[int]'` would work along with with `[type] 'int`' but we felt that it was essentially obfuscating the parsing modes making things overall less clear.

If we're going to rely on it as the primary method of instancing objects, it ought to be much better documented.  It's only ever used in reference to user defined classes in the documentation.\r\n\r\n@BrucePay Ok, so _yes_, there _is_ a reason that New-Object couldn't accept an actual data type instead of requiring a string representation of the data type.  I do see that with this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS > function Test-DataType ($DataType) { $DataType.NameSpace }\r\nPS > Test-DataType ([int])\r\nSystem\r\nPS > Test-DataType [int]\r\nPS >\r\n```\r\n\r\n@thezim Hm.  That is basically what I'm trying to do and it does not work for me via the command line or with VSCode's PowerShell module (VSCode 1.25.1, PS module 1.8.2).  Maybe something on my system is just not working correctly, however, because it does seem to work for my coworker.  And it does seem to work for me if I RDP to a server and run PowerShell there.  Looks like I will need to reset my environment completely and test it again.\r\n",

      "body": "Alright, so after correcting my system, I do get code completion with `New-Object`.  I am not sure what was not working before, but it does explain a number of other quirks I've noticed for awhile.\r\n\r\nI do think the suggestion that @vexx32 put forth makes sense, as it's really not clear why these should work:\r\n\r\n    New-Object ([System.URI]) -Argument http://example.com\r\n    New-Object System.URI -Argument http://example.com\r\n\r\nAnd this should not:\r\n\r\n    New-Object [System.URI] -Argument http://example.com\r\n\r\nParticularly when you get to things like typed collections:\r\n\r\n    New-Object System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]      ## OK\r\n    New-Object ([System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]])  ## OK\r\n    New-Object \"System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]\"    ## OK\r\n    [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]]::new()        ## OK\r\n\r\n    New-Object [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]]    ## Error\r\n    New-Object \"[System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]]\"  ## Error\r\n\r\nI understand what @BrucePay means about obfuscation of what's going on, but you've _still_ got inconsistent behavior.  I understand this is the compromise you've opted for, but if concern about users not knowing what's going on is the reason it's like it is now, why isn't it in the documentation somewhere?  \r\n\r\nIt seems particularly odd because the `-as`, `-is`, and `-isNot` operators are completely different:\r\n\r\n    \"5\" -is int     ## Error\r\n    \"5\" -is [int]   ## OK\r\n    \"5\" -is ([int]) ## OK\r\n    \"5\" -is 'int'   ## OK\r\n    \"5\" -is '[int]' ## Error\r\n\r\nIt's just very confusing to me from a language semantic perspective.  I don't think either behavior is wrong, and I do understand what's going on.  It's just not at all intuitive that there are two behaviors here.  It's not intuitive what the conventions are and there's no clarification in the documentation why there's a difference in behavior.  Even `about_Type_Operators` doesn't talk about it, which is the closest topic I can find that discusses data types.  I'm actually kind of surprised there isn't an `about_Types` document that explains the semantics and conventions of types.\r\n",
