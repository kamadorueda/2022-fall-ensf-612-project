I think the correct behaviour is to error if no pager is found.\r\n\r\nWhat needs to be changed is `get-help` doing an [unconditional pipe into `more`](https://github.com/randomvariable/PowerShell/blob/6f3445a48643c8997d637a93606b92d726b7dc65/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InitialSessionState.cs#L4667).\r\nThis would require a try, catch block wouldn't it?\r\n\r\n ",

Another option is to fall back on `Out-Host -Paging`, which maybe isn't supported all that well on any platform, or maybe not at all on some hosts, but at least attempts to offer paging.",
