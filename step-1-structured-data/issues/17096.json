  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nPowershell is great, but there's a lot of very simple things that ideally shouldn't be quite as verbose as powershell requires. One of these is 'touch'\r\n\r\nOne thing for example is when I wanted to create the profile for my admin account, I would like to have been able to just do this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n@'\r\n$PSReadLineOptions = @{\r\n    EditMode = \"Emacs\"\r\n    HistoryNoDuplicates = $true\r\n    HistorySearchCursorMovesToEnd = $true\r\n                ShowToolTips = $true\r\n}\r\nSet-PSReadLineOption @PSReadLineOptions\r\n'@ > $profile\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that's a no go, because several paths along the way to where $profile pointed didn't exist. So instead you have to go through this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nmkdir -p $profile # Creates the entire path as a directory, including the very last item that should be just a file\r\nrmdir $profile # Deletes the very last bit that should have been a file\r\n\r\n@'\r\n$PSReadLineOptions = @{\r\n    EditMode = \"Emacs\"\r\n    HistoryNoDuplicates = $true\r\n    HistorySearchCursorMovesToEnd = $true\r\n                ShowToolTips = $true\r\n}\r\nSet-PSReadLineOption @PSReadLineOptions\r\n'@ > $profile\r\n```\r\n\r\nWould be nice if I could just do 'touch $profile' and be done with it, or if > would create the path and file if needed. Or even better: Both. Yes, I know you can just create an alias for it, but aliases don't really help all that much in a lot of cases, particularly in this situation. In cases like this where you're setting up an account you haven't used before, or even logging into a system you haven't used that particular account on before.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
