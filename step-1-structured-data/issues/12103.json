      "body": "My initial inclination is to avoid widening to double unless we get input that is either `float` or `double` and instead widen from `int64` to `BigInteger` as that'll get us more directly representative results. For `decimal` inputs, widening to `double` does make more sense, despite the loss of precision.\r\n\r\nA property like `Count` on Measure-Object, for example, could definitely stand to be `BigInteger` on the high end since a `double`-type Count isn't especially meaningful; all it gives you is a rough order of magnitude if you have enough objects. Other properties could, too, but it would be more dependent on the format the data is input in.\r\n\r\nAs for the inconsistencies between parsing and calculations -- I tend to think they should behave pretty similarly. Part of the trouble there is likely that .NET's default widening behaviours don't _quite_ match PowerShell's (at least where the parsing is concerned). Whether that should / could be addressed in a reasonable manner, I'm not sure. It would probably take a fair bit of tinkering around with LanguagePrimitives and the conversion methods there, plus I'm sure a good deal of manual work in the arithmetic operator binders.",

      "body": "Great idea, @vexx32:\r\n\r\nNote: `ValueType` is used here to illustrate which properties are invariably numeric. \r\nBased on @SeeminglyScience's feedback, using just `object` in practice is probably the right choice.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    // To replace both GenericObjectMeasureInfo and GenericMeasureInfo.\r\n    public sealed class ObjectMeasureInfo : MeasureInfo\r\n    {\r\n        public ValueType Count { get; set; }\r\n        public ValueType? Average { get; set; }\r\n        public ValueType? Sum { get; set; }\r\n        public ValueType? StandardDeviation { get; set; }\r\n        // As  before in GenericObjectMeasureInfo\r\n        // Can be reference-type instances, as long as the type implements IComparable.\r\n        public object Maximum { get; set; }\r\n        public object Minimum { get; set; }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis type could then be used with the following type-widening rules, as also suggested in #12141 for\r\n`-Raw`, which would give us unified behavior:\r\n\r\n*  For `-Maximum` and `-Minimum`, whatever input value is identified should be passed through as-is, as is already the case for non-numeric inputs (which is the fix for the bug at hand).\r\n\r\n* For the inherently non-integral `-Average` and `-StandardDeviation` measurements, `[double]` is an appropriate default, but with (at least one) `[decimal]` input `[decimal]` should also be used on output.\r\n\r\n* For `Sum`, all-integer-only input should should also output an integral type (starting with the (largest) input type), with  _automatic type widening_, analogous to the widening (type promotion) that happens in PowerShell's number-literal parsing (`[int]` ->`[long]` -> `[decimal]`, and possibly even to `[bigint]` rather than the `[double]` that is the widest type for number literals. \r\n\r\n * `Count` should widen on demand the same way as `Sum`, though  numbers beyond `[int]` are unlikely to occur in practice, except perhaps if opt-in enumeration of array-valued properties is implemented via the proposed `-Recurse` switch - see #7244.\r\n",

      "body": "@PowerShell/powershell-committee reviewed this, we do not want to take a breaking change for the type of the output object.  Instead, to support this scenario, we would propose a `-ValueType` parameter that takes a enum consisting of the existing members that would output an `object` so that the resulting input type is preserved.",
