However, there is a cross platform editor/debugger for PowerShell.  It is a combination of the [VSCode](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) editor/debugger with the [PowerShell extension](https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell) for VSCode installed.  \n",

I will try it.\nCan i use VScode+powershell extension for directory traversal with autocompleitions etc too, help on commands in command window. I hope that it is as conducive as powershell ISE.\n",
