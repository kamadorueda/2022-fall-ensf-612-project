  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nPutting breakpoint on return will stop on next line rather on return itself. \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction TestMe {\r\n    [cmdletBinding()]\r\n    param(\r\n\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    $Test = Get-Verb\r\n\r\n    Write-Host \"Test\"\r\n    return\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction TestMe2 {\r\n    [cmdletBinding()]\r\n    param(\r\n\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    $Test = Get-Verb\r\n\r\n\r\n    if ($test.count -eq 5) {\r\n        Write-Host \"test1\"\r\n        return\r\n    } elseif ($test.count -eq 1) {\r\n        Write-Host \"test\"\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n    Write-Host \"Test\"\r\n    return\r\n}\r\n\r\nTestMe2\r\n```\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15063294/160710849-527ec8a3-330b-4383-b18a-8334fd79b767.png)\r\n\r\nOriginally reported in https://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/3896\r\n\r\nAccording to @SeeminglyScience it's a PowerShell bug:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15063294/160710991-f8b83f6b-2365-4405-a72f-46ee7afccd17.png)\r\n\r\nThis gets even worse if you try to do a blank line after return and put a breakpoint on return. \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction TestMe2 {\r\n    [cmdletBinding()]\r\n    param(\r\n\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    $Test = Get-Verb\r\n\r\n\r\n    if ($test.count -eq 5) {\r\n        Write-Host \"test1\"\r\n        return\r\n    } elseif ($test.count -eq 1) {\r\n        Write-Host \"test\"\r\n        return\r\n    }\r\n    Write-Host \"Test\"\r\n    return\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nTestMe2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBreakpoint won't be hit. If you put `return \"\"` breakpoint will work properly. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nBreakpoint should be at return as expected.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nBreakpoint stops 1 line after expected place\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.3.0-preview.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.3.0-preview.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nBut is there also for PS 5.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

I do it all the time in C#.\r\n\r\nMore to the point though, are you saying that if a sequence point were added that it would hurt your workflow? If you can think of a way it would negatively impact folks who choose not to set a breakpoint on `return`, that would be helpful in illustrating your objection.\r\n\r\n",

Rewrite binary programs such as kubectl and robocopy into powershell.\r\n\r\n2 cross-platform tui interface text editor, ps1 script.\r\n\r\n3. The rise of the golang command line tool, which does not require an installation environment. just like golang, hope to promote the development of powershell AOT,\r\nAre you interested in these?",
