How come there is not even a preview yet with native support like there is at least one for .NET 6, which by the way is also super freaking slow in supporting this new architecture. Quite disappointing and frustrating that Microsoft operates so rigid and inflexible to industry changes. Honestly, in case this was not totally fucking obvious to Microsoft, but Arm chips like the M1 are the future of computer chips so it's really mind blogging that Microsoft is yet again so blind and late in recognising that trend and lagging behind with the innovation that is happening around them.",

VsCode etc. are already there.",
