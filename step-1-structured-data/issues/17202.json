  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWhen I try to install Powershell-7.2.3.msixbundle, Windows Application Installer tells me it is not signatured ans thus not trusted. It's OK to install using the .msi file. I didn't see this MSIX package's hash value in release note, either, but it's truly within the assets. What's wrong with this?\r\n\r\nBtw I found this problem when try to use WinGet-Create to update the manifest of Powershell in winget-pkg, and winget-create reports an System.IO.FileNotFoundException error. I guess it's the same problem with what I encountered as below.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nMSIX package installed successfully.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nWindows Application Installer tells me it is not signatured ans thus not trusted.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nCurrent Version: 7.2.2\r\nWant to update to: 7.2.3\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
