We could surface `Duration` in the default output of `Get-History`.  It would be easy.  The question is, is this a good \"add\"?  I think so but wonder what other folks think.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nUpdate the format ps1xml file for HistoryInfo to add a table column (right aligned) for Duration using a formatting string like `\"d\\.hh\\:mm\\:ss\"`.  We would need to check the implications of different culture info. \r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
