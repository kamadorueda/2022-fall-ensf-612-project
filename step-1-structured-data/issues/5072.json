      "body": "@iSazonov we cannot remove `TypeCatalogGen`. When you use a type like `[System.Net.Http.HttpClient]`, the type catalog generated by `TypeCatalogGen` kicks in to figure out which assembly should be loaded. The type catalog also plays a role when you are doing a tab completion on a type like `[httpcl<tab>`. The reason is that `GetAssemblies()` can only give you the loaded assemblies, so without the type catalog, you need to make sure `System.Net.Http.dll` is loaded before using any types from it.",
