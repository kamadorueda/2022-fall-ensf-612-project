  "body": "I've tried to remove **Powershell 7.0.0** many, many times from my currently running Windows 10 Insider Build 19268 laptop, but it refuses to go. I've tried to upgrade with many of the 7.1.0-previews, or install _any_ other version\u2014with no luck\u2014all the .msi installers fail to uninstall Powershell 7.0.0 at the same point:\r\n\r\nIt's demanding **obxu42qf.vob.msi** and will not budge. That file is unknown to me and I certainly don't have it. I fully scrubbed my drives and it's nowhere. I suspect it was a transient that slept in the temp folder until it was asked to leave.\r\n\r\nThe first method was the most direct, I thought, by using **Invoke-Expression** with the install script hosted at Microsoft, but I ran into the couldn't find the *_.vob.msi_ file. Next was to uninstall using _Apps and Features...Uninstall_, and always the same stopping point. Since then it's been trying all the various ways I could come up with, and now I'm out of ideas\r\n\r\n**So I'm looking for ways to create a substitute for the missing _.vob.msi_ file, or any method that doesn't involve blindly hacking away in the RegEdit Forest\u2014to make it past an original install temporary _.vob.msi_ file that no longer exists in my universe.**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1682691/82622303-6d149600-9bab-11ea-94f4-1bc463b5b38b.png)",

Thx!\r\n\r\n@he852100 That was my first course of action, but could never find a preview version that worked. After running the troubleshooter and getting past the corrupted state to something I could work with, I tracked obxu42qf.vob.msi down to 7.0.0.6. ",
