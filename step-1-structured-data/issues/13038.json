  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIf this line is pasted into a PowerShell 7 terminal, it will not run (at least on Windows).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> [datetime]$('6/26/2020 (today)' -replace ' \\([^)]+\\)$','')\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might think this is a bad regex (my first thought), but it does actually work:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> '6/26/2020 (today)' -replace ' \\([^)]+\\)$',''\r\n6/26/2020\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I replace the ')' inside the regex, the line will run:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> [datetime]$('6/26/2020 (today)' -replace ' \\([^.]+\\)$','')\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr even removing the type casting will allow it to run:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> $('6/26/2020 (today)' -replace ' \\([^)]+\\)$','')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect it to cut out the ' (today' part of the string and cast the string as a ```[datetime]```.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> [datetime]$('6/26/2020 (today)' -replace ' \\([^)]+\\)$','')\r\n\r\nFriday, June 26, 2020 12:00:00 AM\r\n\r\nPS>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nPasting in the command and hitting enter just activates a new line:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> [datetime]$('6/26/2020 (today)' -replace ' \\([^)]+\\)$','')\r\n>>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PSReadline\r\n\r\nThe current version of PSReadline on my system is 2.0.0, updating to 2.1.0-beta2 made no difference. Even removing the module made no difference: ```Remove-Module PSReadline```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n7.1.0-preview.4:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0-preview.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0-preview.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd also tested in 7.0.2:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",

      "body": "I'm somewhat conflicted on how to fix this. Personally I think we were bound to hit an issue like this in the current \"generic token\" lexing implementation, since the tokeniser is required to recognise a context-free grammar here. That's the parser's job, and the scanner should be generating smaller and more appropriate tokens for it.\r\n\r\nSo we could theoretically make the scanning logic here more complex to try and avoid this, but we'd effectively be duplicating logic from the parser.\r\n\r\nInstead, the right solution would be to emit more tokens, representing a more digested input. In fact we can't even just emit two tokens, since just recognising an attribute requires a stack. Instead I would expect to see tokens like this:\r\n\r\n- LBracket\r\n- Identifier\r\n- RBracket\r\n- DollarParen\r\n- SingleQuotedString\r\n- RParen\r\n\r\nHowever, I worry about what other states bring us to this point in the tokeniser and what such a change could possibly break. (Needing to worry about that is exactly why the parser should be the single point of responsibility of such things)",

I don't think I tried it with the space, but I did workaround it by doing the regex replace and then piping it as a string and type casting elsewhere. It definitely isn't show-stopping for me. I just figured I'd report the bug and let someone with more knowledge of the PS internals decide what to do with that information.",
