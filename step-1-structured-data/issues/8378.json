This Github repository is only for the next generation of PowerShell, which is PowerShell Core.  \r\n\r\nAnd, you are Welcome to contribute to PowerShell Core in improving performance, identifying new features, and even fixing documentation.\r\n\r\nSo, we encourage you to try PowerShell Core in any of it's available version: GA (Generally Available) and/or the Preview.  All these version can be installed alongside Windows PowerShell, down the line it's going to be replace in the future.\r\n\r\nNow after looking around Compress-Archive cmdlet, which is available also in PowerShell Core, seems to only provide the essential to zip files that are not hidden.  I couldn't find any information about providing support for hidden files.\r\n\r\nIf I'm correct, this could be a possible feature that can be requested for PowerShell Core only moving forward (not for Windows PowerShell).\r\n\r\nIf you like to check out this year MS Ignite video about the future of PowerShell, click on the following link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fFAND6OCKU&feature=youtu.be\r\n![winpos_core_2018-12-02_17-39-57](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19892435/49345932-6877bd00-f659-11e8-93b3-188f84ec360b.jpg)\r\n",
