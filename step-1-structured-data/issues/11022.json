  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n`Get-Random` currently requires you to specify a `-Count` argument in order to extract a random subset from an input collection.\r\n\r\nSometimes you want to _shuffle_ an input collection, i.e. to return _all_ input objects, in randomized order, and it would be nice to be able to express that intent directly, without having to provide a `-Count` (which may not even be known; you can work around that with `-Count ([int]::MaxValue)`, but that is awkward).\r\n\r\nTo that end, a new `-Shuffle` parameter could be introduced:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING - sample output.\r\nPS> 1..5 | Get-Random -Shuffle\r\n4\r\n2\r\n5\r\n3\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "What should happen if one had set both `-Count` and `-Shuffle` parameters? Should the command return just <Count> random objects and ignore the `-Shuffle` switch or return the entire collection, in randomized order, despite the `-Count`? Another possible way is to throw an error, but I don't think it is a good solution.",

      "body": "I think the most elegant solution would simply be to put the -Shuffle parameter in a completely different parameter set, so that it can't be used with -Count, via the `Parameter` attribute:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n[Parameter(Mandatory = true, ParameterSetName = \"ShuffleSet\")]\r\npublic SwitchParameter Shuffle { get; set; }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen when determining your code path you can use `switch (ParameterSetName)` to determine which code path to take. \ud83d\ude42 ",
