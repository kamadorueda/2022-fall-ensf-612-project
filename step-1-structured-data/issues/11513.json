  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6?view=powershell-6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n This results in an error  that there is no method msgbox. You can also run a get-member -static on the actual [Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction] object and you will see that in ps7 there is in fact no msgbox method.\r\n```\r\n  [void] [System.Reflection.Assembly]::LoadWithPartialName(\"Microsoft.VisualBasic\") \r\n    $prompt = [Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction]::MsgBox(\"Test\", \"OkOnly,SystemModal,Critical\", \"test\")\r\n\r\n```\r\nWe expect there to be a msgbox method, executing the above in ps 5.1 works perfectly. Below s the msgbox method.\r\n\r\nMsgBox          Method     static Microsoft.VisualBasic.MsgBoxResult MsgBox(System.Object Prompt, Microsoft.VisualBasic.MsgBoxStyle Buttons, System.Object Title)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nPSVersion 7.0.0-rc.1\r\n",

However, I would need to do significant work updating this in all the places the visualbasic class has been used within carying ps scripts.\r\n\r\nWould be nice to figure out why it doesnt work in 7. But have already stored this away as a potential work around.",
