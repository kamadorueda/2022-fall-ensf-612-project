  "body": "If I have a program, for example this Go program:\r\n\r\n~~~go\r\npackage main\r\nimport \"fmt\"\r\n\r\nfunc main() {\r\n   fmt.Print(\"North East\\n\")\r\n   fmt.Print(\"South West\\n\")\r\n}\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThis program produces no carriage returns at all, only newlines. However if I do this:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nprog.exe > prog.txt\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nPowerShell takes it upon itself to add carriage returns to every line. I only want PowerShell to faithfully output what my program created, nothing more. So I tried this instead:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nprog.exe | Out-File -NoNewline prog.txt\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nand PowerShell didnt add carriage returns, but it went ahead and removed the newlines too. How do I do what I am trying to do?",

So if you do something like this:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nwest.exe | east.exe\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nIf `west.exe` only emits newlines, PowerShell injects carriage returns into the pipe, so `east.exe` might fail if it is not expecting carriage returns, or if it is expecting binary data.",

NuShell pipes the commands without adding anything:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nD:\\Desktop\\etc\u3009.\\west.exe | .\\east.exe                  \r\n\"hello world\"\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nCompare with PowerShell, which adds carriage return and newline:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nPS D:\\Desktop\\etc> .\\west.exe | .\\east.exe\r\n\"hello world\\r\\n\"\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nSo I am uninstalling PowerShell, and use NuShell from now on.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/nushell/nushell",
