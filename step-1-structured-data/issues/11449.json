For that it uses [standard Ansi codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). On Linux/Mac it always worked fine. On Windows, I had to depend on Jansi to convert those Ansi codes to something Windows friendly.\r\n\r\nI read that Win10 now supports Ansi codes, so I removed the Jansi dependency (https://github.com/dialex/JCDP/issues/25) and tried to run the lib again. Sadly it didn't work on Win PS6... I'm not sure why. Is it because I need to enable the [\"Virtual Terminals\" feature](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/new-experimental-console-features/)? Then why does it work out of the box for Win Terminal?",
