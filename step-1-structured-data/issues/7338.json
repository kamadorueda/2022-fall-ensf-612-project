  "body": "When I first tried to use the new markdown commands to show a markdown file, it seemed obvious to me that I'd just run:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Expected:\r\nShow-Markdown .\\README.md\r\n```\r\nbut that doesn't work.  You have to execute this instead:\r\n```\r\n# Actual:\r\nConvertFrom-Markdown -path .\\README.md -AsVT100EncodedString | Show-Markdown\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that `Show-Markdown` should have a Path parameter set so that you can simply specify the path to a markdown file to be shown.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-preview.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0-preview.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Agreed. I think this is not intuitive and is probably a leaky abstraction. The fact that markdown ascii/utf8 gets converted to ecma48 / vt100/102/220 control sequences seems like a detail nobody should know nor care about. Note that the console isn't even strictly vt100 (it also supports colour which isn't part of vt100).\r\n\r\nI'd suggest keeping the convertfrom-markdown cmdlet and shipping show-markdown as a wrapper function that invokes it and dumps out the VT string. Please add proper positional hints to the parameters too. ",
