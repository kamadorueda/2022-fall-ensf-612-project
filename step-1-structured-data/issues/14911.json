To give a sense of the relative performance: with `-ReadCount 0`, the command finished in about 4 seconds on my machine; without it, it took almost 17 minutes(!).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**Re line-length limit**:\r\n\r\nI haven't looked at the source code, but there's no practical limit on the line length that I can detect:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-Content test.txt -Value ('x' * 9e6) # create a single-line file with 9 million characters.\r\n@(Get-Content test.txt)[0].Length # correctly outputs `9000000`\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPlease add a reproducible example to your initial post to show what isn't working, and what you would think should be done about it.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
