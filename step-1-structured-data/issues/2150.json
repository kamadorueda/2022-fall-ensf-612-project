If I use `net localgroup <groupname> /comment:\"<Here is where I put my description>\"` I can go far past 48 characters. This restriction seems unreasonable especially given that you cannot replicate the descriptions of builtin groups such as the local 'Administrators' group which has a description containing 75 characters.\n\nLocal Administrators description (75 chars)\nAdministrators have complete and unrestricted access to the computer/domain\n",
