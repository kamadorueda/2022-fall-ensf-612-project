  "body": "Runspace creation in trusted script running under ConstrainedLanugage mode was failing with an unneeded security check.  The security check occurred during the creation of the Question built-in variable and is unneeded because it is being created/set in a trusted context.\n\nFix is to create the built-in question variable at the same location and in the same way that other built-in variables are created.\n",
