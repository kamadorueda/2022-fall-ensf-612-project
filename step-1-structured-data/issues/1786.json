  "body": "@PaulHigin, Please review to ensure this is what you actually wanted.\nFrom @PaulHigin  #1507 \nThese changes add support for PowerShell remoting over SSH. This includes creating new transport objects to use SSH as the PSRP remoting transport along with a new parameter set for the New-PSSession, Invoke-Command, and Enter-PSSession cmdlets. The parameters are HostName, UserName, and KeyPath to allow both SSH password prompt (for interactive sessions) and key based user authentication.\n\nThis check in is to support PowerShell SSH remoting demos and the final parameter sets will likely change in the future. I also have a list of known issues that will be added to this GitHub repo.\n\nThe changes affect Win32 full, core, and Linux versions. For Linux, some types such as WindowsIdentity information were left null. Also, the crypto helper that is based on Win32 native APIs is abandoned for Linux since SSH provides the encrypt/decrypt.\n\nPowerShell SSH remoting requires SSH to be installed on both client (ssh.exe) and server (sshd.exe) along with a PowerShell build including these changes. In addition, the server (sshd.exe) configuration must include the ability to launch a PowerShell subsystem in server mode, and I'll add a new document to describe how to do this.\n",
