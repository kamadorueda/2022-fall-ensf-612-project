  "body": "The current implementation of `Sort-Object` appears to use a [word sort](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318144(v=vs.85).aspx) when sorting strings.  For many scenarios, this is confusing / inappropriate behaviour.   \r\n\r\nSuggested improvement: Add a parameter to define the sorting method.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    [Parameter()]\r\n    [ValidateSet('WordSort','StringSort','CharCodeSort')]\r\n    [string]$ComparisonPreference = 'WordSort'\r\n```\r\n\r\n* WordSort - the current behaviour\r\n* StringSort - enables the `SORT_STRINGSORT` flag; i.e. hyphens and apostrophes are treated  the same as all other punctuation.\r\n* CharCodeSort - sorts strings by its characters' byte code - e.g. in a case-sensitive sort, `^` would appear between `Z` and `a`.  In a case insensitive sort characters would be treated as lower case (users can always put strings to upper case before calling sort if the reverse is required).\r\n\r\nAlternatively, allow users to provide a `StringComparer` (or better yet, an `IComparer`) for each property being sorted.  This could be implemented by allowing a `Comparer` key on the `Property` parameter's [hash table.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/reference/5.1/microsoft.powershell.utility/sort-object?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396#-property); thus giving the full array of options.\r\n\r\nOriginated from a question on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44731470/powershell-sorting-string-objects-with-a-special-character/44732124#44732124",
