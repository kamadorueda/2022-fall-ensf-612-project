Originally, we were looking at Json contents which started and ended with the array markers (\u2018[\u2018 and \u2018]\u2019); however, there is no need to have an end marker check. The reason for this is that we are only trying to detect an invalid array when multiple lines are piped to ConvertFrom-Json, and these will always start with \u2018[\u2018. If an array is detected (starts with \u2018[\u2018), then it will be validated by JArray.Parse(input).\r\n",
