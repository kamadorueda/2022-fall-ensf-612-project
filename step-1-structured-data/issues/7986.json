Although certainly a cleaner implementation, it does not meet the bar for breaking changes as identified by the guidance above.\r\n\r\nEven if fixing this causes a breaking change for PowerShell Core, that would be far less impactful than the breaking change for users coming from Windows PowerShell.",

I can see why it might be nice to have for backwards-compatibility purposes on occasion, but have people actually *used* `-Encoding Byte` commonly? I really can't say I've ever seen it (not that that means it *shouldn't* be restored, just trying to gauge how serious this issue could be in practice, really).",

This change occurred prior to the PSCore 6.0 GA where our philosophy included taking opportunity to fix issues that were known to be breaking but improving the platform.  The breaking change contract was authored after 6.0 GA and we certainly have been applying it since.  At this time, without additional customer feedback, it seems that the number of hits in the corpus based on the size of the corpus doesn't justify spending effort to add this back.",
