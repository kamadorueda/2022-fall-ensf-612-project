And why $h.keys gives 2 items, while $h.count is 1. I guess $h is being unrolled and that is how it is working. Still, not what I would have expected from -NoEnumerate. \r\n```\r\n<#\r\n.SYNOPSIS\r\nConvert a stream of objects to a Dictionary\r\n.EXAMPLE\r\n$services = Get-Service | ConvertTo-Dictionary {$_.Name} {$_.DisplayName}\r\n#>\r\nfunction ConvertTo-Dictionary {\r\n    param(\r\n        [ScriptBlock]$KeyExpression,\r\n        [ScriptBlock]$ValueExpression = { $_ }\r\n    )\r\n    begin { $Result = @{} }\r\n    process { $Result[(&$KeyExpression)] = (&$ValueExpression) }\r\n    end { $Result } \r\n}\r\n\r\n<#\r\n.SYNOPSIS\r\nConvert a stream of objects to a HashSet\r\n.EXAMPLE\r\n$services = get-service | select -expandproperty Name -first 10 | ConvertTo-HashSet \r\n$null -eq $services # False\r\n$Services = get-service | select -expandproperty Name -first 0 | ConvertTo-HashSet \r\n$null -eq $services # False\r\n#>\r\nfunction ConvertTo-HashSet {\r\n    begin { $hashSet = [System.Collections.Generic.HashSet[String]] @() }\r\n    process {\r\n        $hashSet.add($_) | Out-Null\r\n    }\r\n    end { Write-Output -NoEnumerate $hashSet }\r\n}\r\n```",
