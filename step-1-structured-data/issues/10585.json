  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a scripter,\r\nI want a `$PSUserHome` automatic variable that contains the path to the folder where a user profile, configuration file, etc. are stored,\r\nso that I can work with that location when appropriate more easily.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nAdd a `$PSUserHome` automatic variable, that would be the current user equivalent of the `$PSHome` automatic variable. Store the base folder in which user profiles (`$profile`) are written in that automatic variable, and mark it as read-only.\r\n\r\n# Alternate proposals/considerations\r\n\r\nI'm not 100% sold on the `$PSUserHome` name. While it is similar to `$PSHome`, I wonder if users might confuse it with `$Home`. I'm not sure what else would be an appropriate name for this folder though. Suggestions for better names than `$PSUserHome` are welcome and appreciated.",
