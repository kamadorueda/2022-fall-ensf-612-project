  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThe following script, which should creates a Service Principal in Azure and assigns it a given Azure AD role, fails in the last step, precisely when assigning the role to the service principal. \r\n\r\n```\r\n<#\r\nparam (\r\n  [Parameter(Mandatory = $True)]\r\n  [string]$tenantId,\r\n\r\n  [Parameter(Mandatory = $True)]\r\n  [string]$spName,\r\n\r\n  [Parameter(Mandatory = $True)]\r\n  [string]$role\r\n)\r\n\r\nConnect-AzureAD -TenantId $tenantId\r\n\r\n# Create the Azure AD Application Registration\r\n$appRegistration = New-AzureADApplication -DisplayName $spName\r\n\r\n# Create the Service Principal\r\nNew-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId $appRegistration.AppId\r\n\r\n# Get the role object from the given role name\r\n$AdminRoleObject = Get-AzureADDirectoryRole | Where-Object {$_.DisplayName -eq $role}\r\n\r\n# Assign the role to the app registration\r\nAdd-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember -ObjectId $AdminRoleObject.ObjectId -RefObjectId $appRegistration.ObjectId\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nThe service principal is created in Azure AD, and has the given Azure AD role assigned to it\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe service principal is created in Azure AD, but the script fails the Azure AD role assignment. By observing the error message, it seems that an extra '/' is added to the URL, like in the following: https://graph.windows.net//\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nAdd-AzureADDirectoryRoleMember: Error occurred while executing AddDirectoryRoleMember \r\nCode: Request_BadRequest\r\nMessage: The URI 'https://graph.windows.net//xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx/directoryObjects/xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx' is not valid since it is not based on 'https://graph.windows.net/xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx/'.\r\nRequestId: ce7e548a-642a-4998-a153-910671c812ee\r\nDateTimeStamp: Tue, 18 Jan 2022 15:01:40 GMT\r\nHttpStatusCode: BadRequest\r\nHttpStatusDescription: Bad Request\r\nHttpResponseStatus: Completed\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Darwin 21.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 21.\u2026\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
