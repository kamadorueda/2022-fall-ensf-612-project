  "body": "# PR Summary\r\nFix #5555\r\nFix #9769\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a  -SkipHttpErrorCheck flag to Invoke-WebRequest and Invoke-RestMethod, and adds a -ResponseStatusVariable option to Invoke-RestMethod. The -SkipHttpErrorCheck flag causes the cmdlets to ignore HTTP error statuses and continue to process the responses and write to the pipeline as if these had been successful. The -ResponseStatusVariable assigns the integer value of the status code to the variable named. It can be used with or without -SkipHttpErrorCheck.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThese cmdlets as they are currently written will throw an exception when the HTTP status is not considered a success. The error handling code will extract the body of the response and modify its contents to assign to the exception, but will leave the original body contents inaccessible. This isn't feasible with web APIs and other sites that return useful diagnostic messages in the body that would be modified by the error handling code.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4724\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
