In case of loading from custom assembly location and in order to not writing full path.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nFor example:\r\n```\r\nusing assembly $HOME\\libs\\taglib-sharp\\taglib-sharp.dll\r\n```",

In a `using` statement that switches from current directory relative to script relative (confusing I know).",
