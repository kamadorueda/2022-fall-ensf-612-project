  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThis is a common problem.  It is needed when the only interface to pass some structured data to some system is through a string with embedded strings to arbitrary depth.  This includes logs parsing and even output for human consumption under some circumstances.\r\n\r\nAddressing it as PS standard will prevent re-implementation of bugs by everybody who needs this functionality.\r\n\r\nSome common quote escaping rules:\r\n- C\r\n- PowerShell\r\n- bash\r\n- cmd.exe\r\n- CreateProcess\r\n- URI\r\n- XML\r\n- JS\r\n- JSON\r\n- ASCII\r\n- QP\r\n\r\nExample interface:\r\n```\r\nPS > Get-Alias q\r\n\r\nCommandType     Name\r\n-----------     ----\r\nAlias           q -> Get-QuotedString\r\n```\r\n```\r\nPS > q -Rule JSON -String 'test \"quoted\"'\r\n\"test \\\"quoted\\\"\"\r\n```\r\nRelated #9965",
