  "body": "I often use Restart-Computer to restart two or more computers along with the Wait parameter so I know when they are back online.  Sometimes I will get one or more computer fail to respond after the reboot.  Unfortunately the progress bar just show a count of the number of computers that are complete.  It then hangs waiting for the non-responding computers to respond without giving any indication as to which one that is.\r\n\r\nRestart-Service has a nice warning message that it's waiting for a service to stop/start.  This would be ideal here but that could be quite spammy if it was doing that for every computer being restarted.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nRestart-Computer -ComputerName COMPUTER01, COMPUTER02 -Wait -Verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nGive some indication as to which computer it is waiting for\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n![Restart-Computer](https://i.imgur.com/fWmXrYZ.png)\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 6.1.7601 S\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
