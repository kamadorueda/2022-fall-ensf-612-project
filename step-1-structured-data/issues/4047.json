Commit - remove trailing white spaces\r\n\r\nMotivation - So far we have not been able to use VS Code automatic removing trailing white spaces without the cleanup.\r\n\r\nThe cleanup is done with @lzybkr script from #3001 \r\n\r\n2. Commit - remove extra Newline at EOF\r\n\r\nA few days ago in #3576 I saw Resx files without Newline at EOF. Now they're miraculously gone. I don't know who and how to fix it. Now I only found files with extra Newline at EOF. Fixing script is based on script above and attached.\r\n\r\n[fix_EOF.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/1085124/fix_EOF.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
