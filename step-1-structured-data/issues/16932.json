  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nThe `$PSStyle` variable allows us to set the color of most output streams, which only excludes `Progress`, `Information`, and `Output`. During development, I tend to set `$global:DebugPreference = $global:VerbosePreference = $global:InformationPreference = 'Continue'`. To distinguish from output I would like to be able to set a different default color for the `Information` stream, as otherwise it shows up in the console amongst any output that is being returned by an invocation and I visually perceive it as a string that leaked out of my function.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "I think this is an interesting ask. Playing with `$PSStyle.Formatting` a bit more and I found that the color decorations for the warning stream is missed when redirecting the stream to a file, even if `$PSStyle.OutputRendering` is set to be `Ansi`. It's probably the same for the debug and verbose streams as well, but didn't check them myself.",
