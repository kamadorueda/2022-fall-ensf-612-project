  "body": "All common parameters that have to do with streams follow a two-letter alias format (first letter of the stream name followed by the first letter of \"Action\" or \"Variable\"). In fact, `-InformationVariable` has an alias of `iv`. So why does `-InformationAction` break the mold with an alias of `infa` instead of simply using `ia` as an alias? I couldn't find any competing `ia` alias in common parameters.\r\n\r\nThis issue should be addressed by adding `ia` as a secondary alias for the `-InformationAction` common parameter.",
