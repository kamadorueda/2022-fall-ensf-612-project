Install Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.1 from https://aka.ms/WMF5Download to enable this feature.\r\n\r\n@agonzalezm This error message indicates that the `Defender` module is not compatible with PS 7.\r\nThe `Defender` module on Windows 10 is compatible with PS 7 -- `Depender.psd1` has `CompatiblePSEditions = @('Desktop', 'Core')`, but I don't think the module on Windows 8.1 has this compatibility. Therefore, PS 7 needs to load it using the [Windows PowerShell Compatibility feature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_windows_powershell_compatibility?view=powershell-7), which requires Windows PowerShell 5.1 and won't work with Windows PowerShell 4.0.\r\n\r\nOne workaround is to run `Import-Module Defender -SkipEditionCheck`. `-SkipEditionCheck` will force to load an incompatible module without going through the Windows PowerShell Compatibility feature. It may not work if the module just simply doesn't work in .NET Core, so you have to try it out.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSImages/microsoft_logo_56x56.png?version=ad0d2fa7-0ee8-4e82-ddbf-8ea5dc9d9c23\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>Microsoft Download Center</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54616\">WMF 5.1</a></strong></div><div>Windows Management Framework 5.1 includes updates to Windows PowerShell, Windows PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC), Windows Remote Management (WinRM), Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).
