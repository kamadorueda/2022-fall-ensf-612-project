When I hit tab twice I can see that all modules are listed twice.\r\n\r\n**PowerShell Version:**\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      4.0\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nBuildVersion                   6.3.9600.17400\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.2\r\n```\r\nPSReadLine is version 1.2.\n\n_Copied from original issue: lzybkr/PSReadLine#477_",
