      "body": "I am not able to reproduce. If I set the proxy in IE, IWR uses the proxy by default. I tested this using manual settings in Internet Explorer, manual settings in the registry, and a proxy connection configuration script. This can all be tested using fiddler and adding a custom rule in the `OnBeforeRequest()` section\r\n\r\n```none\r\nif (oSession.clientIP == \"::ffff:127.0.0.1\") {\r\n    oSession.Ignore();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen proxy settings are set, IWR/IRM requests will show up in fiddler. When the `-NoProxy` is used while the proxy settings are in place, requests are not show in fiddler. When the proxy is not set, requests are not shown in fiddler. \r\n\r\nThe only method I have not tested is DHCP configure proxy (which I do not have the infra to test with).  If there is any issue with proxy detection, it might be there.",
