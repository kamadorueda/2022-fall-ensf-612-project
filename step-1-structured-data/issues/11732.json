      "body": "It would be nice for PowerShell 7 users to be able to use those directly. Is there any chance for some of those to be returned into PowerShell 7?\r\n\r\nAnd by now I hope that PowerShell 7.0 is feature complete - so except for making the error messages more actionable when using these commands, I'd not want more to go into PowerShell 7.0. For example:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\foo> enable-computerrestore\r\nenable-computerrestore: The term 'enable-computerrestore' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [4,General]: The most similar commands are: Enable-ComputerRestore, Disable-ComputerRestore.\r\n```\r\nor\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\foo> start-transaction\r\nstart-transaction: The term 'start-transaction' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [1,Transactions]: Once a transaction is started, only commands that get called with the -UseTransaction flag become part of that transaction.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [4,General]: The most similar commands are: Start-Transaction, Start-Transcript, Get-Transaction, Set-DtcTransaction, Use-Transaction, Undo-Transaction, Get-DtcTransaction.\r\n```\r\nSaying a command is not recognised then suggersting you use that very same command is really a poor experience. IMHO this really needs to be addressed before 7.0 RTM. \r\n",

It appears that namespace is back in 3.1, so we could bring them back in 7.1.  For the ComputerRestore cmdlets, it seems that the original code was using WMI APIs which wasn't supported in CoreCLR until 3.0, we could bring those back as well in 7.1.",
