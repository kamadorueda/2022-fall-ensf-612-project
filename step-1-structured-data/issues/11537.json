  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen I copy an SDDL string from another computer and use ConvertFrom-SddlString to view it in a form that is easier to understand, ConvertFrom-SddlString discards the security IDs that it is unable to translate to NT account names.  It would be more convenient if ConvertFrom-SddlString displayed them as SID strings in that case.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nFor example, if S-1-5-82-269044437-150487689-1149708198-3394286750-593715923 (which would be algorithmically generated from `IIS APPPOOL\\Sandbox`) is not defined in the local computer:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\> convertfrom-sddlstring -Sddl \"D:AI(A;OICI;0x1200a9;;;S-1-5-82-269044437-150487689-1149708198-3394286750-593715923)\" -Type FileSystemRights\r\n\r\nOwner            :\r\nGroup            :\r\nDiscretionaryAcl : {: AccessAllowed (ListDirectory, Read, ReadAndExecute, ReadAttributes, ReadExtendedAttributes, ReadPermissions, Synchronize, Traverse)}\r\nSystemAcl        : {}\r\nRawDescriptor    : System.Security.AccessControl.CommonSecurityDescriptor\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would like to see this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\> convertfrom-sddlstring -Sddl \"D:AI(A;OICI;0x1200a9;;;S-1-5-82-269044437-150487689-1149708198-3394286750-593715923)\" -Type FileSystemRights\r\n\r\nOwner            :\r\nGroup            :\r\nDiscretionaryAcl : {*S-1-5-82-269044437-150487689-1149708198-3394286750-593715923: AccessAllowed (ListDirectory, Read, ReadAndExecute, ReadAttributes, ReadExtendedAttributes, ReadPermissions, Synchronize, Traverse)}\r\nSystemAcl        : {}\r\nRawDescriptor    : System.Security.AccessControl.CommonSecurityDescriptor\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I don't really care whether the asterisk is there or not. `ICACLS` expects the asterisk when given a numerical SID on the command line, but it does not output an asterisk when it displays an unmapped SID in an ACL.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps this can be implemented just by changing the exception handler in `ConvertToNTAccount` <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/40e77b88b59918c82ccbe5234df7ee3ad421bd51/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/ConvertFrom-SddlString.cs#L48-L58>",

At the other side, the output of [!sd](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-sd) is both more readable and more detailed than that of `ConvertFrom-SddlString`.\r\n- Breaking changes not allowed\r\n",
