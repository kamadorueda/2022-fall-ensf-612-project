  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> pwsh -noprofile -command \"rg \\\"el\\\"\\\" .\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the command is badly escaped, so it doesn't form correct powershell command.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe correct way (that is parsed and behaves fine) is  as following\r\n```\r\npwsh -noprofile -command \"rg \\\"el\\`\\\"\\\" .\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nError should be reported. This worked in powershell:\r\n```\r\n> powershell -noprofile -command \"rg \\\"el\\\"\\\" .\"\r\nThe string is missing the terminator: \".\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : TerminatorExpectedAtEndOfString\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNothing is printed. No error, nothing. Even `rg` with corrupted arguments is not executed. The command line is completely silent.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "I think so, yes. The symptom is a regression from Windows PowerShell and seems specific to the CLI's parsing of its `-Command` / `-c` argument.\r\n\r\nWhat PowerShell ends up seeing as the command to execute is `rg \"el\"\" .`, which is syntactically invalid - an error should be reported, as still happens in Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\n",
