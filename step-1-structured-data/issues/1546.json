  "body": "There is more that I would like to change, but knowing the speed at which our docs are updated, I would like to submit this as a first pass.\n\nThe readme is mostly rewritten, with a helpful table for getting PowerShell (packages, installation, building, and test status). The PowerShell description of COM and WMI did not make much sense for cross-platform PowerShell; I'd like @joeyaiello's help to come up with an improved description. I removed the TODOs as they should instead be tracked by issues (and not in the readme on the master branch).\n\nI fixed a few docs folders where eponymous documents were turned into readmes so that browsing the folders on GitHub is more readable. My goal will be to have a readme for every folder.\n\nWe really need to consolidate our submodule notes; they've become spread far and wide, but I'd like to do this separately.\n\n/cc @vors @joeyaiello @jianyunt \n",
