  "body": "TabExpansion could be a really nice feature of PowerShell, but it's very difficult to easily expand it. Usually if you want to you end up writing code like this:\n\n```\nif (Test-Path Function:\\TabExpansion) {\n    Rename-Item Function:\\TabExpansion TabExpansionBackup\n}\n```\n\nThis approach is fine for a single module to extend TabExpansion, but you start running into all sorts of issues (like name collisions) when multiple modules start trying to do the same thing.\n\nIt would be great if there were a mechanism to register TabExpansion functions. e.g \n\nRegister-TabExpansion -Command cmd.exe -ScriptBlock/File\n\nInternally this function would simply be a map between the command (or an alias) and the function which would be called if the command is matched.\n\nOnce there is a consistent mechanism for TabExpansion it should be fairly easy for people to write modules to add expansions for various tools (git, rake, npm, etc), making powershell much more useable.\n",

      "body": "We need better documentation, but tab completion is pretty extensible right now.\n\nExtensibility was part of the design introduced with `TabExpansion2` in V3, but registering completers wasn't, so I created [TabExpansionPlusPlus](http://github.com/lzybkr/TabExpansionPlusPlus) to help register those completers.\n\nIn V5, we added `Register-ArgumentCompleter` which is nearly identical to the one in `TabExpansionPlusPlus`. We also added the attribute [ArgumentCompleter](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c1faf1e6e10fc1ce45e84ef6f49ae7136c67a111/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandCompletion/ExtensibleCompletion.cs#L27) which can be used in both [C#](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/GetCommandCommand.cs#L102) and in PowerShell.\n",
