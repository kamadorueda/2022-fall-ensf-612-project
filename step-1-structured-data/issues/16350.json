  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCurrently, `Enter-PSSession` only behaves as expected - _synchronously_ entering an interactive remote session - when called _directly_ from an _interactive_ PowerShell session.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, it fails obscurely when called via `pwsh -Command` or from inside a `*.ps1` script (even if you called from an interactive session).\r\n\r\nNote: If these scenarios cannot be supported for technical reasons, (a) the cmdlet would ideally detect these scenarios and _refuse to run_ and (b) the limitation needs to be documented.\r\n\r\nCLI example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# On Windows, from an elevated session on a machine that is set up for remoting.\r\n# On Unix, set the machine up for SSH remoting and use -Hostname  instead of -ComputerName\r\npwsh -nop -c 'Enter-PSSession -ComputerName .; $host; exit'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAn interactive remoting session (to the same machine) should be entered.\r\n\r\nOnly after manually exiting that session should `$host` and `exit` execute, in the _local_ session, at which point the `pwsh` call as a whole should terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nA remoting session is initiated, but _local processing continues instantly_; that is, the local commands following `Enter-PSSession` are _executed right away_, locally.\r\n\r\nBecause the `exit` then terminates the entire process, an interactive remote session is never entered.\r\n\r\nIf `exit` is omitted, the `pwsh` call _hangs_, and even <kbd>Ctrl-C</kbd> doesn't help (this doesn't happen with `powershell.exe`, which exits implicitly).\r\n\r\nIf, by contrast, you were to place  `Enter-PSSession -ComputerName .; $host` - without the `exit` - in a `*.ps1` file and were to execute that file from an interactive local session, `$host` would execute locally right away, and a remote session would be entered _only after the script terminates_.\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-rc.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
