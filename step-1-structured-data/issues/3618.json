  "body": "PowerShell Core Edition doesn't have a `Set-Clipboard` command. I've tried using `pbcopy` on Mac OS X, but it doesn't seem to work well with certain UTF-8 characters, like emojis. For example, using my Emojis PowerShell module, on the PowerShell Gallery, the `pbcopy` command pastes an emoji into my web browser as a question mark.\r\n\r\nHaving a high-quality `Set-Clipboard` command would be convenient from a first-class PowerShell perspective, and resolving bugs similar to those with `pbcopy`.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTrevor Sullivan",
