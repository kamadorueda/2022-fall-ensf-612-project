Feel free to close. \r\n\r\nI've noticed a lot of big projects that have a solid following tag certain issues with a tag such as \"first-time contributors\" or \"good first bug\". \r\n\r\nThe idea is that new people (like myself) who want to contribute but don't really know how or where to get started have a place to start.\r\n\r\nIt'd be really sweet if the Powershell repo had this!",
