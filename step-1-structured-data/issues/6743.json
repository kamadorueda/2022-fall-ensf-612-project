  "body": "## Overview\r\n\r\n`Clear-RecycleBin` produces spurious error records when used in Windows PowerShell. (Yes I know this repo is dedicated to PowerShell Core, but since it contains the code, and UserVoice isn't quite effective, I'll just put the analysis here.)\r\n\r\nIn a freshly launched PowerShell instance, running `Clear-RecycleBin -Force` will produce the following error (whether or not the recycle bin is empty does not matter at all):\r\n\r\n```text\r\nClear-RecycleBin : The system cannot find the path specified\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Clear-RecycleBin -Force\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (RecycleBin:String) [Clear-RecycleBin], Win32Exception\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : FailedToClearRecycleBin,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.ClearRecycleBinCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, subsequent invocations to the same command (with `-Force`) will not produce such error. Moreover, in a newly launched PowerShell instance, running `Clear-RecycleBin` (without `-Force`) and manually confirming the operation) will not write error.\r\n\r\n## Root Cause\r\n\r\nUpon close investigation, the root cause starts on [line 226](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/ffa7e4bac0b2546c5a61fad7cd87ae353e3264dc/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/ClearRecycleBinCommand.cs#L226) of `ClearRecycleBinCommand.cs`. Relevant excerpt:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nuint result = NativeMethod.SHEmptyRecycleBin(IntPtr.Zero, drivePath,\r\n    NativeMethod.RecycleFlags.SHERB_NOCONFIRMATION |\r\n    NativeMethod.RecycleFlags.SHERB_NOPROGRESSUI |\r\n    NativeMethod.RecycleFlags.SHERB_NOSOUND);\r\n\r\nint lastError = Marshal.GetLastWin32Error();\r\nprogress.PercentComplete = 100;\r\nprogress.RecordType = ProgressRecordType.Completed;\r\nWriteProgress(progress);\r\n// 0 is for a successful operation\r\n// 203 comes up when trying to empty an already emptied recyclebin\r\n// 18 comes up when there are no more files in the given recyclebin\r\nif (!(lastError == 0 || lastError == 203 || lastError == 18))\r\n{\r\n    Win32Exception exception = new Win32Exception(lastError);\r\n    WriteError(new ErrorRecord(exception, \"FailedToClearRecycleBin\", ErrorCategory.InvalidOperation, \"RecycleBin\"));\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe mistake here is to use `GetLastWin32Error` -- according to [`SHEmptyRecycleBin` function (Windows)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762160.aspx) on MSDN, the function uses `HRESULT` to indicate error status. The documentation does not mention `GetLastError`, and it is true that the function does **not** call `SetLastError` on the caller thread before returning.\r\n\r\nThe fact that `GetLastError` returns 3 on the first invocation of `Clear-RecycleBin -Force` is purely accidental.\r\n\r\nPlaying around with `SHEmptyRecycleBin` indicates that it returns `S_OK` (`0`) for success (also documented), and `E_UNEXPECTED` (`0x8000FFFF`, catastrophic/unexpected failure) when the recycle bin is already empty. At this time, I would suggest remove error detection in the cmdlet, since `SHEmptyRecycleBin` doesn't know how to handle the case when the recycle bin is already empty at all -- we can't expect it to do any reasonable failure indication.\r\n\r\nThere could have been a time when `SHEmptyRecycleBin` uses `SetLastError` to indicate failure, and the code could have been written when the documentation wasn't updated.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI wrote a blog entry on this issue, and I found that the code is wrong in every way. If you're interested, read https://geelaw.blog/entries/clear-recyclebin-shemptyrecyclebin/\r\n\r\nMistakes made summarised into a list:\r\n\r\n- not declaring `[DllImport(SetLastError = true)]` and using `Marshal.GetLastWin32Error` to retrieve the possible error code set by `SHEmptyRecycleBin`, which won't work and will get the leftover of previous marshalled calls.\r\n- documentation for `SHEmptyRecycleBin` doesn't indicate that it will call `SetLastError`, and recommends that one use the return value to determine error status.\r\n- `SHEmptyRecycleBin` doesn't expect to deal with already emptied recycle bin.\r\n\r\nI would recommend anyone using this cmdlet use `Clear-RecycleBin -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` to prevent irrelevant `ErrorRecord`.\r\n",

Instead, I'd consider using `Trash` as the aliased noun. Plus, it doesn't make sense to stick to the name with more specs using it. I'd like it when PowerShell keeps more pure Windows genes and that it spreads them to the other world. (I'm a Microsoft fanboy, and you could ignore this suggestion, and I will understand.)\r\n- Restoring from Recycle Bin could be very hard to use -- it would be hard to locate an item. One possible way for this is to let the cmdlet return a set of recycled items, where each item has an identifier (consistent across invocations but platform-dependent), date of removal, restoration path (sometimes might be unavailable) etc., and another cmdlet would restore items. I would suggest not having such cmdlets.\r\n- However, it's rare that PowerShell provides something dedicated to opening GUI. The only two examples I've found are `Show-WindowsDeveloperLicenseRegistration`, which opens up Settings app on Windows 10, and `Out-GridView`, which outputs the objects into an interactive window for inspection. Plus, **such functionality isn't very useful in scripting automation**. (The last sentence is arguable because PowerShell already provides some cmdlets with GUI. I would say `Show-WindowsDeveloperLicenseRegistration` isn't very useful, which can be replaced by `Start-Process ms-settings:developers`, which doesn't do the unnecessary administrative privilege check before it opens something that cannot be administrative-privileged.)\r\n",
