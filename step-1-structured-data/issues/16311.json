  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI am writing a small dynamic DNS plugins for windows. Now I need to get the ip address of a specific NIC. So I decided to use the pwsh command like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(Get-NetIPAddress -AddressFamily IPv6 -InterfaceAlias 'vEthernet (Ethernet_UCAS)' -PrefixOrigin RouterAdvertisement -SuffixOrigin Link).IPAddress\r\n```\r\n\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\nBut after run this command in a python's subprocess, I got the output like the following.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17793356/138982892-373cce86-f700-4a5f-a7fa-d3fb59d23cd8.png)\r\n\r\nIt looks like the pwsh.exe has runned with PSReadLine powershell module. But I don't need this.\r\n\r\n**Is there any possible way to run pwsh.exe with no module imported?**\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

Also use `-NonInteractive` to prevent PSReadLine from loading e.g.:\r\n```\r\npwsh.exe -nologo -noprofile -noninteractive -executionPolicy bypass -command \"& { ... }\"\r\n```",
