  "body": "Here is a CR comment in #4020:\r\n>I see that you are following a pattern like `IsSameFileSystemItem` or `IsHardLink`. Ideally, code here should be refactored to consolidate Unix/Windows implementations in one place and eliminate wrapper functions like `IsSameFileSystemItem` and `IsHardLink`. Instead, they should be\r\n```CSharp\r\ninternal static bool IsSameFileSystemItem(string pathOne, string pathTwo)\r\n{\r\n#if UNIX\r\n   // Unix implementation goes here\r\n#else\r\n   // Windows implementation goes here\r\n#endif\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code should be refactored to reflect the above comment.\r\n- [ ] Refactor the existing methods there to consolidate the Unix/Windows implementations at one place.\r\n- [ ] The type is `InternalSymbolicLinkLinkCodeMethods`, so for utility methods that are not directly related to `SymbolicLink`, such as `GetInodeData`, maybe a separate type should be created to hold them.",
