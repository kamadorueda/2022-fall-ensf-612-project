Open Poweshell. \r\n2. Type `ping 8.8.8.8`, This is kind of necessary to show my problem. Any command that prints >1 line of output'll do just fine. \r\n3. Now, Type \"some text, Doesn't matters what it is\". So, Now your shell will look something like this. \r\n    \r\n    `powershell C:> some text, Doesn't matters what it is`\r\n4. Now press `Ctrl+L`(On Windows). \r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nIt should clear the output printed by the `ping` command and move the prompt to the top of screen without deleting the text \"some text, Doesn't matters what it is\".  This is the behaviour shown by pretty much all shells on linux. \r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIt just prints `^L` to console. Sometimes it does what I mentioned in the \"Expected behaviour\" section but most of the time it just prints `^L` in console which is quite annoying. \r\n\r\nI am a begninner in C# and if someone can give me some pointers on what's causing this problem I can try fixing it. \r\n\r\nRegards \r\nIshan Jain\r\n\r\nPS: \r\nI searched Github issues, Known Issues page with terms like \"Clear screen\", \"Ctrl+L\" and \"^L\" but didn't found anything relevant.
