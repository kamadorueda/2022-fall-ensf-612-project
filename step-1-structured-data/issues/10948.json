  "body": "In many contexts PowerShell uses the invariant culture for string operations for predictable operation irrespective of the session's current culture.\r\n\r\nFor instance, `\"$(1.2)\"` (string interpolation in expandable strings) yields `'1.2'` even in cultures that use `,`, not `.` as the decimal mark, and cast to numeric types (e.g., `[double] '1.2'`) are similarly culture-invariant.\r\n\r\nThe `-split` and `-replace` operators implicitly convert their LHS operands to strings, if they aren't, but while `-split` commendable uses the culture-invariant conversion (as in expandable strings), \r\n**`-replace` is unexpectedly culture-sensitive**\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nDescribe \"Culture-invariance tests for -split and -replace\" {\r\n  BeforeAll {\r\n      $prevCulture = [cultureinfo]::CurrentCulture\r\n      [cultureinfo]::CurrentCulture = 'fr' # The French culture uses \",\" as the decimal mark.\r\n  }\r\n  It \"-skip: LHS stringification is not culture-sensitive\" {\r\n    1.2 -split ',' | Should -Be '1.2'\r\n  }\r\n  It \"-replace: LHS stringification is not culture-sensitive\" {\r\n    1.2 -replace ',' | Should -Be '1.2'\r\n  }\r\n  AfterAll {\r\n      [cultureinfo]::CurrentCulture = $prevCulture\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe `-replace` test fails:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n      Expected: '1.2'\r\n      But was:  '12'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, `1.2` was unexpectedly stringified culture-_sensitively_, as `'1,2'`.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.5\r\n```\r\n",
