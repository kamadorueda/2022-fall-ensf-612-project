This isn't much of an issue, as I believe it mostly only affects aesthetics of printed paths.  What is the best practice for maintaining consistent path output cross-platform?\r\n\r\n\r\nPossibly related--\r\nIf I'm on *nix, my `PATH`s use `:` delimeters; if I'm on Windows, my `PATH`s use `;` delimiters.   Would a similar strategy apply?",

      "body": "You have a couple options. One is to just avoid dealing with paths directly, and always use Joi-Path and Split-Path as needed. I tend to do this a fair bit.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to use a variable separator, for example the slash for paths on the current system is exposed in `[System.IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar` so you can just define a variable like `${/} = [IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar` and just use that variable to insert platform appropriate slashes.\r\n\r\nWith respect to PATH separators, a similar thing applies; you can pull the appropriate character frow `[System.IO.Path]::PathSeparator`\r\n\r\nAlso, where slashes are concerned you can often cheat a bit and just always use forward slashes in a lot of cases. Windows filesystems don't care which slash you want to use, but Unix only recognises forward slash, so you could opt to just always use forward slashes.",

      "body": "The simple answer is:\r\n- Always use forward slashes `/` -- Windows is more forgiving.\r\n- Always `Convert-Path` when passing paths to applications -- PowerShell's PSDrives result in paths that aren't real (e.g. the new `Temp:` drive in PS7)",
