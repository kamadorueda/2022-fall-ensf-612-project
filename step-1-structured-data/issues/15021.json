      "body": "`.Count` is not a property of the created object. `[PSCustomObject]@{}` creates one object with zero properties attached. Ergo, you have a count of 1. \r\n\r\nThis is by design for how the `.Count` auto-property works; if you don't have a collection object (or an object with a property named `Count` itself), `.Count` will be `1` for non-null objects, and `0` for null.",
