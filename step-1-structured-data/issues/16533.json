I'd imagine not, as it seems to present an opportunity to circumvent the system's ExecutionPolicy.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nDescribed above.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nDescribed above.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNo error returned.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22504\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45504030/144103430-88fe7dbc-e0ca-4abb-a7e2-a7d7f8b34349.png)\r\n",

But it doesn't much seem to matter; Windows Terminal, cmd, a windows PowerShell process; I run pwsh.exe, I end up with the Execution Policy as detailed in the image.\r\n\r\nTo create this image, just now, I started a user level 'cmd' process, and called `pwsh.exe -noprofile` from it. I then ran `Get-ExecutionPolicy -list` and the results are the same. Process level is bypass. After that, I exited the 'pwsh' process, and started a 'powershell' process and ran `Get-ExecutionPolicy -list` just to show the difference, should it be relevant.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45504030/145899544-796eec4b-e5d8-48f1-a92a-dea7fc35fa78.png)\r\n\r\nWhere might I go to figure out what might be doing it?
