  "body": "Since PowerShell 7.0.0-preview.6 now has Out-GridView again I will re-report the bugs i reported on uservoice 4 years ago since the bugs are still present.\r\n\r\nWhen using Out-GridView to display objects that have properties with underscores in the names, like `User_Name`, the resulting column displayed in Out-GridView is `UserName`, missing the underscore. \r\n\r\nBehavior is also inconsistent so if the property is named `Name_Of_User` then it displays `NameOf_User`, so removing the first one only.\r\n\r\nMultiple underscores seems to get truncated to one so `__` displays as _ and `___` displays as `_`\r\n\r\nIt does not affect the actual property names of the output when using `-PassThru` so it is only displaying it wrong.\r\n\r\nCommon scenario is you are looking at data from a csv file by `Import-Csv | Out-GridView` that you got from someone and you se the column `UserName`. You write some filter for the data based on property `UserName` but it does not work since the property was named `User_Name`\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[pscustomobject]@{\r\n    With_underscore = \"somedata\"\r\n    With_two_underscores = \"moredata\"\r\n    With__double_andsingle = \"even more data\"\r\n    whatdoes___tripledo = \"can i have data\"\r\n} | Out-GridView\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nI expected the column names in Out-GridView to have the same names as the properties\r\n\r\nWith_underscore With_two_underscores With__double_andsingle whatdoes___tripledo\r\n--------------- -------------------- ---------------------- -------------------\r\nsomedata        moredata             even more data         can i have data\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26866146/69498401-0fe3a480-0ee8-11ea-87d3-91991a664aac.png)\r\n\r\nInstead it is truncating _ char in the column names. Single _ is removed, double __ is reduced to one _ and triple ___ is reduces to a single _.\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
