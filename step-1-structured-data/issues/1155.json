  "body": "This is left-over from #1148 \n\nWe are building pwrshplugin.dll for FullCLR build, but we need it for Nano server as well.\nNano server is a little bit trickier, because it requires installing of https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk\n## Message Compiler\n\nWe use **mc.exe** for Full build to compile native resources and it fails in CI\nhttps://ci.appveyor.com/project/PowerShell/powershell/build/0.4.0.2558#L206 (this is build from master)\n\nThere are two problems:\n- [x] Fix the failure\n- [x] Find out why it didn't fail the build and fix this: such errors must fail the build: **Answer:** because I didn't use `Start-NativeExecution` helper function.\n",
