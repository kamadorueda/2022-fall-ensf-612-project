It becomes a single string pattern *containing a comma and a space*. It matches text \"*abc anything comma space xyz anything*\":\r\n\r\n    @{test='abc1, xyz2'} |Where-Object test -like abc*, xyz*\r\n\r\nThat is, it *does* work in line with the uniform syntax, it's just misleading you about *which* syntax applies.\r\n\r\nThis is different from the operator used with quotes `-like \"abc*\", \"xyz*\"` which is parsed as lzybkr describes - an array joined together using the value of `$OFS` as the separator (space by default), so the comma doesn't become a part of the pattern but a space does.\r\n\r\nAnd with the operator, trying to use the example with no quotes `@('zzz', 'abc1', 'xyz2') -like abc*, xyz*` is a parse error.\r\n\r\nIf the suggested `-likeany` became a parameter on `where-object` then this slightly misleading pattern would apply to it in the same way:\r\n\r\n    |where test -likeany abc*                # abc* wildcard\r\n    |where test -likeany abc*, def*          # \"abc*, def*\" wildcard surprise\r\n    |where test -likeany \"abc*\", \"def*\"      # multiple wildcards \"abc*\" and \"def*\"\r\n\r\nAnd the original issue would still be here: `Where-Object test -likeany abc*, def*` doesn't work as expected, because the expectation was not thinking about parameter parsing mode.\r\n\r\nPresumably with a new operator there would be variants `-clikeany`, `-ilikeany`?\r\nWhat about `-notlikeany`, `-cnotlikeany`, `-inotlikeany`?\r\n\r\nShould that pattern extend to `-matchany`, `-notmatchany`, `-containsany`, `-notcontainsany`, `-anyin`, `-notanyin`) and their case variants? `-likeall`?\r\n\r\nIf not, then you get the weird situation where `-likeany` becomes the de-facto `-containsany`:\r\n\r\n    $collection -contains 'a'\r\n    #How do I test if it contains an 'a' or a 'b'? \r\n\r\n    #you can use:\r\n    $collection -likeany 'a', 'b'\r\n\r\n    # > why are they named differently?\r\n    # contains is an object in a collection, likeany is a string match but it works for a collection of strings\r\n    # that will bite you one day.\r\n    # oh and it acts as a filter instead of returning a [bool]..\r\n\r\nI would vote for a breaking change to make it work with `-like`, personally. Most, if not all, the existing operators work with an array on one side or the other, without needing a variant on the name specifically for the case of working with an array. And possibly adjust `-contains @('a', 'b')` similarly, so it doesn't join the array.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nI see the original issue - matching multiple patterns - appears over and over on StackOverflow as a thing people trip over, expecting there to be a clean way and there isn't. This seems like a helpful fix for that. But..\r\n\r\n> an arcane tome of RegEx Spells and come up with devilry like this example\r\n\r\nIn defence of regex, it *is* a language specifically for describing patterns in text, and the use of `^`, `()` and `|` is not as arcane and devilish as claimed; regex is a first class citizen in PowerShell already - in common operators like `-split` and `-replace`, and it's available in every popular language, many popular text editors, and many other data processing tools.\r\n\r\nAt what point is it reasonable to say \"honestly, your next move should be: spend an hour with a regex tutorial, it's really not that bad\"? Is there anything that can be done to make it less intimidating?\r\n",

When the input is a collection, the operator returns the elements of the collection that match the right-hand value of the expression. If there are no matches in the collection, comparison operators return an empty array.\r\n\r\nMeaning, according to the documentation, this: `'a', 'b' -in 'b', 'c'` which currently returns a Boolean (`$false`), should actually *return the elements of the collection that match the right-hand value of the expression*.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say: `$a -eq $b` (where `$a` could be a collection), is in fact similar to `$a -contains $b` (and `$b -in $a`, where the operators are swapped) with the exception that `$a -eq $b` returns a truty/falsy (which could be more useful) and the later comparisons return an explicit Boolean (`$True`/`$False`).",
