  "body": "I have an issue when using Get-PSDrive on an Azure Virtual Machine\r\nIf I run this command, usually it should return free disk space. However, when I ran this command,  there's no free disk data returned.\r\n![powershell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57062529/94767761-f355aa00-03df-11eb-824a-26cdbe8e655d.png)\r\n\r\nI have done the following steps\r\n1. run powershell as administrator but no change\r\n2. checked Windows OS version: Windows Server 2016 Datacenter-10.0.14393.0\r\n3. checked Powershell version: 5.1.14393.3866\r\n\r\nI have another Azure VM which has the same environment but I can run this command to get free disk space successfully.\r\n\r\nMay I know how this command get free disk space from disk? Is it possible to fix this issue?\r\nBesides, if it\u2019s possible to see the source code of this command?
