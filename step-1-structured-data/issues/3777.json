Unlike #2761 and #2975 (similar -Credential requests), there doesn't seem to be any restriction that prevents a -Credential parameter from being implemented. I only took a quick look through the .NET docs on ACL classes, so I very well could be wrong on that.\r\n\r\nWhile Invoke-Command would work, it would force a weird usage in my opinion. Everything I've used so far supports -Credential, then all of a sudden for working with ACL's I'd have to shove the ~10 lines of logic into a scriptblock and either choose to invoke it against localhost or the remote computer that holds the file shares (since Invoke-Command requires a -ComputerName when -Credential is used). That's not a fantastic option since it additionally requires remoting to be available when Get-ACL only requires Share\\NTFS permissions regardless of local vs remote file locations.",

Even running a powershell session as the same use as passed via creds works just fine. Even doing an invoke-command and trying to \"ls AD:\" will fail as a drive with the name AD doesnt exist, attempts to import the module within the function complain that 'the server might be down'.
