  "body": "From: Wim Coekaerts:\n\n... the binary and libraries and a bunch of ps1xml files are all in /usr/local/share/powershell. Would it make sense to separate them out in bin/  lib/ etc/ ?   In fact, even though for \u20183rd party\u2019 it\u2019s typically a good idea to have things in /usr/local or so\u2026 at least in the old days, there\u2019s also possibly /usr/ (like anything native) or /opt/Microsoft/ or so. This can be religious some times with some folks but I think a bit of a split of bin/lib would be good either way \u2013 location-wise  usr/local/ is not bad but I am not sure if that\u2019s typical any more.\n",
