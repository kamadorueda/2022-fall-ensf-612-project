  "body": "We are referencing a PS1 file \"Library.ps1\" in another PS1 file \"Feature.ps1\" and invoking a function defined in the Library. The function has an optional parameter which is defined as an Enum Type using Add-Type -TypeDefinition within the same library.  The feature powershell file invokes the function without passing this optional enum parameter and we have noticed that it fails intermittently with the below error  :\r\n\r\nUnexpected exception: [The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect]. TRAP_DETAILS: ErrorFile [C:\\Library.ps1], ErrorLine [29: Add-Type -TypeDefinition $EventType]\r\n\r\n**Sample Code as below :`**\r\n\r\nBelow is the definition of EventType :\r\n\r\n          $EventType = @\"\r\n              public enum EventType\r\n              {\r\n                  StartEvent,\r\n                  EndEvent,\r\n                  Informational,\r\n                  Failure\r\n              }\r\n          \"@\r\n          \r\n          Add-Type -TypeDefinition $EventType\r\n\r\n          Function LibraryFunction\r\n          {\r\n          param([Parameter(Mandatory=$true)]\r\n              $ID,\r\n              [Switch]$parameter1,\r\n              [Parameter(Mandatory=$false)]\r\n              [EventType]$EventType,\r\n              )\r\n\r\n          Write-Host $ID\r\n          }\r\n\r\nBelow is the way the function is being invoke in the feature file :\r\n\r\nLibraryFunction -ID 3 -parameter1 \r\n\r\nCould you help us in understanding why this error is being thrown intermittently? The code keeps failing in production with the above error and when we try the execution, the same code path executes fine. Any help is much appreciated!\r\n",
