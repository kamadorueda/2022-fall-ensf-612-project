  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCreate 2 links and 1 file:\r\n```bash\r\ntouch foo\r\nln -s bar foo\r\nln -s baz bar\r\n```\r\n\r\nso you have baz -> bar -> foo\r\n\r\nI used the following Cmdlet to exemplify the error:\r\n```cs\r\nusing System.Management.Automation;  // Windows PowerShell assembly.\r\nusing Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands;\r\n\r\nnamespace SendGreeting\r\n{\r\n  [Cmdlet(VerbsCommunications.Send, \"Greeting\")]\r\n  public class SendGreetingCommand : Cmdlet\r\n  {\r\n    protected override void ProcessRecord()\r\n    {\r\n      WriteObject(\"Hello \" + name + \"!!\");\r\n      string fileName = FileSystemProvider.NameString(new PSObject(new System.IO.FileInfo(\"/home/user/baz\")));\r\n      WriteObject(fileName);\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```pwsh\r\nImport-Module /home/user/Cmdlet/bin/Debug/net5.0/Cmdlet.dll\r\nSend-Greeting\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nbaz -> bar\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nbaz -> foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\nThis differs with Windows and also seems to differ when realpath fails since it fallsback to readlink:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Native/blob/deb01d6f65b07a0861933a2986cce2318fd60492/src/libpsl-native/src/followsymlink.cpp#L39-L54\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /home/jozky/pscore> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.4\r\nOS                             Linux 4.19.128-microsoft-standard #1 SMP Tue Jun 23 12:58:10 UTC 2020\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

It's unknown if PowerShell has internal code that rely on the current behavior. This _is_ a breaking change as the API results may be different, so anyone relying on previous results may be affected.",
