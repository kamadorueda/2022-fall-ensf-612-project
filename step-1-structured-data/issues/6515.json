      "body": "I've removed a couple of the parameters given. The rest are the coverage file itself and the OpenCover installation directory. In the case of the code coverage XML, there's no indication of where it is unless the user explicitly states it, so I think better to document it. In the case of the OpenCover installation directory, the default is `$HOME`, and we don't provide or give directions to clean up afterward. I don't think we should be installing things into `$HOME` by default and not telling users or cleaning up afterward, so I think for now we should just give them the parameter to set (and recommend the temp directory). I feel like I'm a fairly new user and the most confusing parts to me are where something is not documented or implicit -- if I found OpenCover under `~` a few days later, I would have no idea where it came from or whether I could delete it -- so I'm going to leave those parameters in.",

      "body": "@rjmholt separate from this PR, perhaps you can submit a new PR to have OpenCover installed to `~/.opencover` which is consistent with where we stick dotnet and rcedit.  In general, I would prefer the user not to have to specify parameters where not absolutely necessary as we should have good defaults.  If the defaults are not good, let's fix it.  If you think there's any confusion to the end user on where things are being put, it would make sense to have a verbose message.",

Is there any documentation I can work off with respect to the other commands you mentioned?\r\n\r\n~~Also, I noticed that `mdspell` is [locale-specific](https://github.com/lukeapage/node-markdown-spellcheck/blob/b5b7d8151f964191afc28e6f49fd6ec0ddf5ba90/es5/cli.js#L52) - so we should perhaps add the `--en-us` option to our instructions?~~ Actually, `mdspell` defaults to en-GB and is planning to change in the next major version. But there is still option support for `--en-us`.",
