  "body": "It took me forever to figure out how to get Powershell to obey the WindowsPowerShell Group Policy settings. It turns out you need to set \u2018UseWindowsPowerShellPolicySetting\u2019 on every key to be configured. This seems redundant - if somebody is going through that difficulty to edit every single Powershell Core group policy, they might as well set them to the values they want.\r\n\r\nI think it would make sense to look at the WindowsPowerShell keys by default (especially the security ones), but in the worst case \u2013 just one root \u2018UseWindowsPowerShellPolicySetting\u2019 that PowerShell will look at to determine whether to adopt all settings.",
