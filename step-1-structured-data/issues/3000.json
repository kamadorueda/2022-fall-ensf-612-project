      "body": "Thanks @iSazonov.\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT: I don't really know how this would work.\r\n\r\nWould you expect that to work no matter which of the many `Invoke-Command` parameter sets are used? With so many different scenarios/protocols involved when you use `Invoke-Command`, including WinRM, SSH, commands invoked in a VM over the VM bus, etc., is setting remote breakpoints that are actionable in each of those scenarios even possible? If not, does the inconsistency matter to you?\r\n\r\nWhat happens when a breakpoint is hit inside of a script block running in a VM in Hyper-V? Is the debugger able to pick up on that and enter a remote debugging session over the VM bus? I don't think that works today.\r\n\r\nAnd if PowerShell did enter a remote debugging session with the breakpoint on the appropriate line, and you start stepping over lines, would it step out at the end of that script block and come back to stepping through the client?\r\n\r\nOr in the client, would a step into call while `Invoke-Command` is the active command, with no breakpoints set in the script block it invokes, result in stepping into the remote session on the server?\r\n\r\nI think this is an interesting idea with a lot of complications behind it. That doesn't mean it should be dismissed outright, but it definitely does not seem as simple as checking for local breakpoints in the script block and setting remote breakpoints in the remote command target.",
