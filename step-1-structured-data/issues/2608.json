      "body": "Actually, due to the way the \"64-bit enabled\" \"switch\" works in MSI you _must_ have two installers to support both bitnesses.  At least that's what it says in this book: https://smile.amazon.com/Deploying-Supporting-Applications-64-bit-Windows-ebook/dp/B0098P9Z22/  ;)\n\nAs background - 32-bit msiexec.exe itself is subject to WOW64 32-bit in-process redirections - this is done to maximize compatibility with 32-bit software installs on the 64-bit platform - especially script, DLL and EXE custom actions for legacy packages built for as 32-bit OS.\n\nUnfortunately when an MSI is marked as \"being able to service 64-bit\" it also refuses to run on 32-bit.  This one I don't know the background reason for and if it had not been done, one \"64-bit _enabled_\" MSI could potentially serve both bitnesses.\n\nSimilar to a 32-bit setup.exe wrapped around a 32-bit and 64-bit MSI to provide a \"single installer\" experience, the chocolatey package will be able to sort out bitness specific installers automatically.\n\nSince the existing MSI simply copies files, it is ok if the chocolatey package just installs one of them for both win 8 and win 10 ?\n",
