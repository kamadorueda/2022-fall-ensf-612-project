  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nAdd either a switch to disable the \"Write-Error: \" prefix when using Write-Error, or an option to customise it.\r\n\r\nI'm using Write-Error in some automation pipelines that will validate some files and intend to be run in a pipeline by non-powershell users. Because Write-Error \"Error Message\" actually outputs `Write-Error: Error Message`, this could confuse people into thinking it's some kind of disk write error, since they have no idea of the underlying function being called to display this.\r\n\r\nEspecially since I'm writing the errors to a variable using -ErrorVariable that is returned at the end of the script after performing validation on multiple objects, having everything prepended with Write-Error makes even less sense.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nMy ideal solution would be a simple switch to suppress \"Write-Error:\" being prepended to the output, or certainly to suppress it being written to the error variable even if it must be written to the console.",
