  "body": " We can reproduce this now. xUnit, Pester, etc. can't right to stdout if it's not running as root.  The problem actually stems from trying to write directly to  dev stdout when running as another user via sudo  both what the container now does and what I was doing to repro it on the Jenkins slave . CoreFX already contains what I believe to be a fix  https   github.com dotnet corefx pull 3352  Once we've updated CoreCLR, we can backport this fix by bringing in the latest System.Console.dll, and test if it resolves our issue. Otherwise we'll need to find a work around.  Simple repro steps   sudo  u someuser bash echo hi >  dev stdout  Should get a permissions error.  This is  fixed  by pulling in an update to System.Console, which is blocked until CoreCLR is updated.  Patch backported to old version of CLR.
