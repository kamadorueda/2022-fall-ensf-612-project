  "body": "This was reported via LiveFyre comments for [Clear-History](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/clear-history?view=powershell-5.1#comments-container)\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 5 on Windows 10 (at least) the 'Clear-History' cmdlet does not clear any session history, and certainly not the on-disk history. None of the options seem effective, it appears to be entirely borked and quite the security vulnerability. Googling around it appears broken for a couple years at least, with some workarounds found:\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n1) Run: Remove-Item (Get-PSReadlineOption).HistorySavePath\r\n2) Run: [Microsoft.PowerShell.PSConsoleReadLine]::ClearHistory()\r\n3) End the current session\r\n\r\nSee other online discussions:\r\n- https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/stevelasker/2016/03/25/clear-history-powershell-doesnt-clear-the-history-3/\r\n- https://thetechremix.com/2017/02/22/tip-clear-powershell-history-in-windows-10/\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13257775/powershell-clear-history-doesnt-clear-history\r\n\r\n\r\n**After local testing:**\r\n\r\nClear-History does clear the History from the session. Try doing Clear-History then run Get-History. However, that does not clear the history that PSReadline is using. So up-arrow recall of commands still has history information.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.16299.98\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.16299.98\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```\r\n",

That said, I'd want a confirm impact of high on that new command.  I'd be lost if my PSReadLine history were accidentally deleted.  :-)",

We already have ways to clear the history, and ways to clear the buffer; something like clear-history -includebuffer might make more sense with less redundancy.\r\n\r\nAlso, about_psreadline already includes documentation on how it doesn't touch History.

For PSCore6, we deliberately went with a very simple ReadLine implementation in the ConsoleHost deferring all the previous capabilities to PSReadLine so it gets loaded automatically.  Perhaps we can add a `-Scope` type parameter to `Clear-History` that PSReadLine can plug into.  cc @lzybkr ",
