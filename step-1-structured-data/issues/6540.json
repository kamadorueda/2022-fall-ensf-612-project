  "body": "The following code starts a job that outputs an integer once a second.  Subscriptions for some of the job's events are established.  The output of the job is polled by calling `Receive-Job` periodically until the job stops running.  The events are output.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$j = Start-Job {1..5 | % {$_; sleep 1} }\r\n\r\nRegister-ObjectEvent -InputObject $j.Output -EventName 'DataAdded'\r\nRegister-ObjectEvent -InputObject $j -EventName StateChanged\r\n\r\nwhile ( $j.State -eq [System.Management.Automation.JobState]::Running )\r\n{\r\n   $j | Receive-Job\r\n   sleep 0.2\r\n}\r\n\r\nGet-Event | % { $_ | Remove-Event; $_ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the above code is run, an integer is output once per second followed by a single `StateChanged` event as follows:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n\r\nComputerName     :\r\nRunspaceId       : ef1f4543-86d6-410c-9d95-3883faeceacb\r\nEventIdentifier  : 1\r\nSender           : System.Management.Automation.PSRemotingJob\r\nSourceEventArgs  : System.Management.Automation.JobStateEventArgs\r\nSourceArgs       : {Job1, System.Management.Automation.JobStateEventArgs}\r\nSourceIdentifier : 3ece9623-2ef4-4f86-a7ce-bf088f483161\r\nTimeGenerated    : 2018-04-01 5:59:56 PM\r\nMessageData      :\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis demonstrates the following:\r\n\r\n* a `StateChanged` event is not published when new data is available to be received\r\n* no `Job.Output.DataAdded` event is published despite that data was output by the job then received\r\n\r\nIn other words, neither of these two obvious APIs facilitate receiving data from a job as it is output.  I have also noticed that the `.Output` member of jobs seems to always be empty.\r\n\r\nThis leaves me with the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. Is a way of subscribing to or waiting on new data that is added to a job without polling?\r\n2. Why is no `DataAdded` event published when the above code is run?  In what conditions is that event published?\r\n3. Why is the `.Output` property of a job object always empty?  In what conditions is that property populated?",

It does not run any commands or return any results. The commands are actually run by the child jobs. (Jobs started by using other cmdlets might work differently.)\r\n\r\nSubscribing to the `DataAdded` event on the child job as suggested by PetSerAl indeed works to receive data as it is output:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$j = Start-Job {1..5 | % {$_; sleep 1} }\r\n\r\nRegister-ObjectEvent -InputObject $j.ChildJobs[0].Output -EventName 'DataAdded' -SourceIdentifier DataAdded\r\nRegister-ObjectEvent -InputObject $j -EventName StateChanged\r\n\r\nwhile ( $j.State -eq [System.Management.Automation.JobState]::Running )\r\n{\r\n    Wait-Event |\r\n        ? { $_.SourceIdentifier -eq 'DataAdded' } |\r\n        % {\r\n            $j | Receive-Job\r\n            $_ | Remove-Event\r\n        }\r\n}\r\n\r\nGet-Event | Remove-Event\r\nUnregister-Event DataAdded\r\n```",
