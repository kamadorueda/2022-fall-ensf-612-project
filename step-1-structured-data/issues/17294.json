This PR re-enables all of them.\r\nNotably, it removes the test which causes a browser to be launched in the shell as this is not available in a container (or server core). The functionality is still validated by verifying the URL that is opened, but does not launch the browser via a test hook.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves a test for help failures by reporting the name of the topic that has been surprisingly found to aid in debugging.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.

In general, a change size of upto `200` lines is ideal for the best PR experience!\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n<details >\r\n    <summary display=\"inline\"> <strong>Quantification details</strong></summary>\r\n    <p />\r\n\r\n```\r\nLabel      : Small\r\nSize       : +32 -38\r\nPercentile : 28%\r\n\r\nTotal files changed: 7\r\n\r\nChange summary by file extension:\r\n.cs : +13 -6\r\n.ps1 : +19 -32\r\n```\r\n> Change counts above are quantified counts, based on the [PullRequestQuantifier customizations](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/blob/main/docs/prquantifier-yaml.md).\r\n    \r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n    <summary display=\"inline\"> <strong>Why proper sizing of changes matters</strong> </summary>\r\n    <p/>\r\n    <p/>\r\n\r\nOptimal pull request sizes drive a better predictable PR flow as they strike a\r\nbalance between between PR complexity and PR review overhead. PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detetcted.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiSmFtZXNXVHJ1aGVyIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE3Mjk0IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiVGh1bWJzVXAifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiSmFtZXNXVHJ1aGVyIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE3Mjk0IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiTmV1dHJhbCJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoiSmFtZXNXVHJ1aGVyIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE3Mjk0IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiVGh1bWJzRG93biJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",
