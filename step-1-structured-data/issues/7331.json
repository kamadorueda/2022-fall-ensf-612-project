  "body": "I was working on a wrapper for dahall/TaskScheduler since I couldn't find any non-COM working solution for managing scheduled tasks (#7292), and came up with some interesting behavior when going through PS Core against a .NET Standard DLL.  Basically, on the first method call to file checks when using the task scheduler COM returns for some reason with an error:  \r\n\r\n> System.IO.FileNotFoundException, System.Private.CoreLib, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=7cec85d7bea7798e\r\n\r\n Note I have not checked this using his .NET Standard .DLL against regular PS5.1.\r\n\r\nThis may be something with the task scheduler COM objects, or something with PS/Net Standard, or with the project and how it loads COM, but its beyond my skills to debug.  The code works find using his .NET 4.5.2 library against PS 5.1, works fine from a .NET Core Console project, but also fails when trying to proxy the call through a PS .NET Standard Binary Module.  So, the only real common factors I hit were PowerShell and .NET standard for the difference in behavior.  A quick test script module to highlight what is happening is at the following link:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dahall/TaskScheduler/issues/776\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-preview.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0-preview.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nBrief update:  loading the assembly with reflection and performing the calls works, so it's just when loaded from module",
