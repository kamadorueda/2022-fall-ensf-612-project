      "body": "@mklement0 I believe your points are correct. A couple of additional notes:\r\n- Both Linux and OS X recognize NTFS volumes as case-sensitive and will allow creating files with names differing only in case but with different content. I've done this by plugging an NTFS external hard drive into both types of systems.\r\n- Window can \"see\" all such files, but will only open one. For example, Windows Explorer shows both `Fred` and `fred`, but when opening either Windows will always actually open only one of them---it seems to favor ones with upper-case letters in the name.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6708868/25109414/224a19e6-2391-11e7-812b-8a6d4507f011.png)\r\n- I don't know what Windows will do with an ext volume, which is case-sensitive. I assume it will treat it as case-*in*sensitive, but I don't have an external ext volume handy to try it with, so I'm just guessing.",
