This SDK version contains the old 2.0.0. version of the .Net Runtime, see docs [here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.2-sdk-download.md)\r\nDo we not need to update the string to `2.1.4`, which is the SDK containing the `2.0.5` runtime, see docs [here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.5-download.md)?",
