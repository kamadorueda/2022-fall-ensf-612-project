  "body": "Using powershell.exe to execute a PowerShell script using `-File` currently provides no way to pass $true/$false as parameter values.  Current behavior is that `-File` accumulates passed parameters as strings only.\r\n\r\nFix is to special case this based on discussion with PS-Committee to support $true/$false as parsed values to parameters.  Switch values is also supported as currently documented syntax doesn't work.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4036\r\n\r\nDoc change is https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/pull/1430\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
