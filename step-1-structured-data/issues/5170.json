      "body": "For the cmdlet(s) that have this issue, I think the best approach would be to seclude them to distinct parameter sets, preventing them from being used together. \r\n\r\nDepending on existing parameter sets this could get slightly complex, but should be no more complex than adding a series of `[Parameter()]` attributes with appropriate `ParameterSetName` properties; each parameter should be in distinct set(s). Mind that when other sets are present you may need to end up duplicating existing parameter sets to retain other functionality while segregating these two parameters. The important thing is that at least one of the parameters cannot be in the 'default set' (although one could feasibly be to simplify the code).\r\n\r\nGive it a shot, and if you need some more detailed instruction just show me where you get stuck and I'm sure I can point you in the right direction. \ud83d\ude04 ",
