  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs I user, I would like a quicker way to get to the full help and examples for cmdlets. I'll often append \"-?\" as a first step and then decide I would like to see more of the help content. I would be nice if I could arrow up in my command history and just append -Full, -Examples, etc. This would be a bit faster than the tab complete from Get-Help (at least in my imagination).\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI can see this being implemented as a parameter set keying off of \"-?\" where you could add additional Get-Help parameters. Ideally this would apply to all cmdlets automatically.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nTo see the full help:\r\n`Get-Item -? -Full # The same as 'Get-Help Get-Item -Full'`\r\nTo see examples:\r\n`Get-Process -? -Examples # The same as 'Get-Help Get-Process -Examples'`\r\n",
