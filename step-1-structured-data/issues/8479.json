I see no reason why we couldn't add to the functionality of `Compare-Object` with a `-Diff` or `-Detailed` or some similarly-named optional switch, and build on this code to really flesh `Compare-Object` out as a more thorough diff tool, so it can live up to the `diff` alias it carries. \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\n\ud83e\udd14 any such switch would have to imply `-SyncWindow 0` in order to behave as expected, but that's not too bad, just needs another parameter set. \ud83d\ude04 ",
