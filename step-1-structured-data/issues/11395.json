If I close and relaunch PS, the problem comes back until I remove the module again.\r\n\r\n2) I've not been able to reproduce on other hardware yet.  Another laptop on 1909 is working fine, and an 1809 desktop is working fine.\r\n\r\n3) I believe it may be related to a particular hardware platform after further investigation.  I showed the issue to one of our desktop support folks yesterday and on a whim, he pulled off the keyboard and put the device into tablet mode.  The @ symbols stopped appearing in the PS session and we could type commands successfully using the onscreen keyboard.  When the keyboard was re-attached and the machine put back in to normal mode, the problem reappears.  The device is an HP Elite x2 G4.  It is current on all BIOS and system drivers.",
