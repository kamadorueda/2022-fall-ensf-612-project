  "body": "The previous failure we saw was because the most recent annotated tag did not exist in the previous 50 commits. In my experience we've gone about ~300 commits between tags, so I believe 1000 to be safe, but know 100 will not be.\n\nWe should continue to use `git describe` because it encodes both the most recent version and the exact commit past it where it's built.\n\nResolves #2029.\n\nFinding out right now from Travis CI if it's possible to completely disable shallow cloning.\n",
