  "body": "Implementation of #3807 \r\n\r\nThe historical telemetry code uses WindowsUTC which is not applicable to non-Windows platforms and is superseded by our ApplicationInsight telemetry. `#if LEGACYTELEMETRY` was used to make it easier to track when we add our next round of telemetry.\r\n\r\nChange should not be visible to the user, unless they were inspecting the eventlog looking for it. Any SQM telemetry appears to have been disabled in June 2016.",
