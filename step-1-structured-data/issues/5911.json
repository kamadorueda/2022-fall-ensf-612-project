  "body": "This was all tested on a server running Ubuntu 14.04. I have a group on the system called \"sharing\" that my user account and others are a member of to help facilitate sharing of files. Many files have their permissions set to `<different users>:sharing` on a 2nd hard drive on the server. If I use \"rm\" in Bash I can delete files that are setup with these permissions even if my user account is not the owner because I am a member of the same group that owns the file. If I go into Powershell and try to use \"remove-item\" to delete the same file I get an error message saying access was denied.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nExample 1: Bash Only\r\n```bash\r\n# group members\r\n$ cat /etc/group | grep sharing\r\nsharing:x:1001:,tony,plex\r\n# create a test file. These commands were run in BASH.\r\n$ echo \"hello\" >> test_del.txt\r\n$ ls -la | grep test_del.txt\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 tony tony        6 Jan 15 10:45 test_del.txt\r\n# change the ownership of the file\r\n$ chown plex:sharing test_del.txt\r\n$ ls -la | grep test_del.txt\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 plex sharing        6 Jan 15 10:45 test_del.txt\r\n# using \"rm\" in bash can successfully delete the file\r\n$ rm test_del.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample 2: Try to delete the file using PowerShell\r\n```bash\r\n# recreate the test file and change ownership\r\n$ echo \"hello\" >> test_del.txt\r\n$ ls -la | grep test_del.txt\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 tony tony        6 Jan 15 10:45 test_del.txt\r\n$ chown plex:sharing test_del.txt\r\n$ ls -la | grep test_del.txt\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 plex sharing        6 Jan 15 10:45 test_del.txt\r\n```\r\n```powershell\r\n# jump into PowerShell and try to delete the file\r\n> remove-item ./test_del.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample 3: Set the ownership to the current user and sharing group and delete the file\r\n```bash\r\n$ echo \"hello\" >> test_del.txt\r\n$ ls -la | grep test_del.txt\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 tony tony        6 Jan 15 10:45 test_del.txt\r\n$ chown tony:sharing test_del.txt\r\n$ ls -la | grep test_del.txt\r\n-rw-rw-r--  1 tony sharing        6 Jan 15 10:45 test_del.txt\r\n```\r\n```powershell\r\n# PowerShell will be able to successfully delete the file with these ownership settings\r\n> remove-item ./test_del.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n\"rm\" in BASH is able to delete the file so PowerShell should be able to as well. \r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nPowerShell returns the following error:\r\n```powershell\r\n> Remove-Item ./test_del.txt                                       \r\nRemove-Item : You do not have sufficient access rights to perform this \r\noperation.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Remove-Item ./test_del.txt\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : PermissionDenied: (/home/tony/test_del.txt:FileI \r\n   nfo) [Remove-Item], IOException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : RemoveFileSystemItemUnAuthorizedAccess,Microsoft \r\n   .PowerShell.Commands.RemoveItemCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable                                                  \r\n\r\nName                           Value                                           \r\n----                           -----                                           \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0                                           \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                            \r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0                                          \r\nOS                             Linux 4.4.0-109-generic #132~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 9 21:46:42 UTC 2018\r\nPlatform                       Unix                                            \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                         \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                             \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                         \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0 \r\n```\r\n",
