  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nOn Windows, you can create OS-session-wide virtual drive with the `subst.exe` utility; e.g., `subst T: C:\\Temp` creates virtual drive `T:` whose root is `C:\\Temp`.\r\n\r\n`Get-PSDrive` is currently not aware of these drives, so its `.Root` property just reports the virtual drive's root itself rather than the underlying directory.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING:\r\nPS> subst T: C:\\Temp; (Get-PSDrive T).Root\r\nC:\\Temp\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently (PowerShell Core 7.1.0-rc.2), the output is `T:\\`\r\n\r\nNote: It is debatable whether `Convert-Path` should also resolve paths based on substituted drives to their underlying path - currently, it doesn't.\r\n\r\n",
