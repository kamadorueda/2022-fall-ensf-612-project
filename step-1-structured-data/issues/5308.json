  "body": "I've been looking through the documentation on AMSI, and noticed that it supports several types of clean / dirty results (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn889584(v=vs.85).aspx) :\r\n\r\n```\r\ntypedef enum AMSI_RESULT { \r\n  AMSI_RESULT_CLEAN                   = 0,\r\n  AMSI_RESULT_NOT_DETECTED            = 1,\r\n  AMSI_RESULT_BLOCKED_BY_ADMIN_START  = 16384,\r\n  AMSI_RESULT_BLOCKED_BY_ADMIN_END    = 20479,\r\n  AMSI_RESULT_DETECTED                = 32768\r\n} AMSI_RESULT;\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I looked through the PowerShell source code, I noticed that it's only concerned with AMSI_RESULT_DETECTED:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/532044f27ae42f2c4cf3fb178b4f88bbf126e5c1/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/CompiledScriptBlock.cs#L203\r\n\r\nShould PowerShell also take action when it get something in the \"BLOCKED_BY_ADMIN\" result range?",
