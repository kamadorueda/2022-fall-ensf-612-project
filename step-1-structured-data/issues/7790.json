  "body": "It's fair to assume that you typically do _not_ want the newly created, minimized window to steal focus from the calling application when you use `Start-Process -WindowStyle Minimized`.\r\n\r\nThat is, the calling application (console window) should remain the active application and continue to receive keyboard output.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `-WindowStyle Minimized` invariably focuses the minimized window - while the calling window is by definition not _obscured_, it loses _keyboard focus_ that way.\r\n\r\nTwo possible enhancements:\r\n\r\n* Change `-WindowStyle Minimized` to _not_ steal focus.\r\n\r\n* Since that is technically a breaking change - someone may rely on the old behavior, though I have trouble picturing why - alternatively introduce a new style, `MinimizedNoFocus` similar to Visual Basic's [`[AppWinStyle]`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.visualbasic.appwinstyle) enumeration. \r\n  * Conceivably, `NormalNoFocus` could be implemented too (that is, start a process with normal window size, but without giving it focus).\r\n\r\n_Update_:\r\n\r\nA related, but distinct issue is #3028, which concern's the CLI's (the `pwsh` executable's) `-WindowStyle` parameter, notably the ability to start PowerShell as a whole _hidden_.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWritten as of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 6.1.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@BrucePay:\r\n\r\nThis issue and #3028 are distinct use cases:\r\n\r\n* #3028 is about launching _PowerShell itself_,  _completely and persistently hidden_, which is currently impossible without the help of a non-console-subsystem entry point, as proposed in the linked issue.\r\n\r\n* _This_ issue is about launching processes _from PowerShell_ (a visible console window) in a way that:\r\n\r\n  * launches them asynchronously, _initially out of sight_ \r\n  * yet still allows inspecting their output _interactively, on demand_, by manually opening the minimized window.\r\n\r\nTherefore, this issue calls for a different solution, namely an enhancement to the `Start-Process` cmdlet, as proposed.",

      "body": "@mklement0 You didn't mention `Start-Process` in the issue so I assumed you were talking about `pwsh` itself. Thanks for clarifying. Perhaps you could update the issue text to include this information. As to supporting this functionality, the API you mentioned is only available by including the VisualBasic assembly which isn't likely in Core.  It should be possible to use interop to implement the equivalent in pwsh but it would be better if it were supported in CoreFx since it is a base OS kind of thing. I'm inclined to mark it as \"resolution external\" but I suppose some enterprising individual could decide to do it in PoweShell instead.",

      "body": "Thanks, @BrucePay: `Start-Process` was in the _title_ to begin with, but I've now added it to the initial post for clarity.\r\n\r\nYes, arguably `[System.Diagnostics.ProcessStartInfo]` should always have provided this functionality - though it's quite likely this will always remain a Windows-only feature.\r\n\r\nTo future readers / potential implementers in PowerShell: It is the `ShellExecute[Ex]` WinAPI function that provides the requisite functionality.\r\n\r\nExamples of using  the VisualBasic assembly you  mention (Windows only):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nAdd-Type -Assembly Microsoft.VisualBasic\r\n# Launch a GUI application in a minimized window without focus:\r\n[Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction]::Shell('Notepad', 'MinimizedNoFocus')\r\n\r\n# Launch a console application in a minimized window without focus\r\n# !! Specifying a console application *directly* doesn't work, because it would run in the \r\n# !! *current* console window.\r\n# !! The *conhost.exe workaround* requires *Windows 10*\r\n[Microsoft.VisualBasic.Interaction]::Shell('conhost cmd /k echo hi', 'MinimizedNoFocus')\r\n```",
