  "body": "> private static SemanticVersion s_psV6Version = new SemanticVersion(6, 0, 0, \"alpha\");\r\n\r\nBackground: PSVersion is hard-coded in `PSVersionInfo.cs`, and this wasn't aware of until we pushed the release tag and built packages. This PR is a temporary workaround to unblock the release.\r\n\r\nIt includes 2 changes:\r\n1. Change s_psV6Version to `new SemanticVersion(6, 0, 0, \"beta\");`\r\n    This version shouldn't be hard-coded, #3739 shall be fixed.\r\n2. Change `Start-PSBuild` to always write `\"v6.0.0-beta.1\"` to powershell.version.\r\n    This hack shall be reverted after the release. Tracking by #3741",
