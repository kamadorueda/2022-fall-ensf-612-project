  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nCreate a MOF using a DSC Resource that uses a PSCredential on one Windows Server 2016 Machine using a certificate File then apply it on a Windows Server 2016 computer that has the private key for the certificate file under the local machine my store.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nDecrypt the credentials and use them to access a file share\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nI have created a Pull Server Configuration. I have created the DSC Signing Certificate using a custom template on a Enterprise Root CA which has worked for 2012R2 nodes and also tested using xDSCUtils New-xSelfSignedDscEncryptionCertificate.\r\nI kept getting errors when passing in credentials. I therefore wrote a tiny custom DSC Resource that Displays the Password as clear txt when I run Start-DSCConfiguration -Wait -Verbose\r\nYou can find it [here](https://gist.github.com/aboersch/65e846a4966fe2c4708ed21d655a54a7)\r\nThe Client does not correctly decrypt the Credentials. As a Password I am receiving\r\n```powershell\r\n-----BEGIN CMS-----\r\n<Long Multi-Line Base64 String>\r\n-----END CMS-----\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I pass this to Unprotect-CmsMessage I receive the correct Password.\r\nThe Certificate passes $.PrivateKey.KeyExchangeAlgorithm and $.Verify\r\nI have tried changing the Certificate Provider to '\"Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0\"', '\"Legacy Cryptographic Service Provider\"', and '\"Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider\"'.\r\nI have already tried these: \r\n[DSC problems with Credentials and build 10586](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34006865/dsc-problems-with-credentials-and-build-10586)\r\nhttps://wespoint.wordpress.com/2017/01/19/powershell-dsc-encryption-issue/\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\nBoth Systems are Windows Server 2016 from Azure with identical PSVersionTables\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value                                                                                                                  \r\n----                                -----                                                                                                                  \r\nPSVersion                      5.1.14393.1066                                                                                                         \r\nPSEdition                      Desktop                                                                                                                \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                                \r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.14393.1066                                                                                                        \r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000                                                                                                        \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                                    \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion    2.3                                                                                                                    \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1  \r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease find attached the certificate that I used.
