      "body": "Hi @frogamic, the @( ... ) operator guarantees that the result produced by the code inside is always an array. This operator semantic was introduced because of the way streaming works. If the pipeline returns a single element, you don't know if it's supposed to be a scalar value or an array of one element. @( ... ) guarantees that you will always get an array even if the pipeline returns 0 or 1 elements. This way you don't have to special-case your code to handle scalar and non-scalar values.",
