  "body": "The [\"step-by-step\" documentation for updatable help](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2017/02/01/installing-latest-powershell-core-6-0-release-on-linux-just-got-easier/) indicates that it's a best practice to digitally sign your HelpInfo XML files. However, there aren't any specific directions, that I can find, that would indicate exactly how this is accomplished.\r\n\r\nAre there any directions on how to digitally sign updatable help? Is this something that can be done cross-platform, or is it only possible on Windows?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n**Trevor Sullivan**\r\nDocker Captain\r\nMicrosoft MVP: Cloud & Data Center Management\r\nhttps://trevorsullivan.net\r\nhttps://twitter.com/pcgeek86",

I think if you added an authenticode signature any of the help files, it would break the help system.\r\n\r\nI expect that the individual files installed by `Update-Help` would need to be catalog-signed. That includes:\r\n- the HelpInfo.xml file\r\n- Module MAML file(s)\r\n- any about_*help.txt files\r\n",
