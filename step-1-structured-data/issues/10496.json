Snapd will have added a /snap/bin to your path, but your shell is not loading it.\r\nTry running pwsh by specifying it's full path:\r\n`/snap/bin/pwsh`\r\n\r\nIf that works, you can workaround the issue with the following command assuming you are using bash\r\n`echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/snap/bin' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc`",
