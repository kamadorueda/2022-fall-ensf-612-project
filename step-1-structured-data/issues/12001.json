This repository tracks issues in PowerShell 6+.\r\n\r\nThe module path is set here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/20a236b228d024ed23bf12c9331bbbb484e3836c/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/ModuleIntrinsics.cs#L968-L972\r\n\r\nIt seems that `$HOME` variable comes from the `$env:USERPROFILE` environment variable:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a34d0f3e808659b0c07b8fdac83aaae1dae43c21/src/System.Management.Automation/CoreCLR/CorePsPlatform.cs#L182\r\n\r\nIt's not clear whether the inconsistency is intended, but given that this behaviour is longstanding and likely unable to be changed, we might want to move this issue to the docs repo.",
