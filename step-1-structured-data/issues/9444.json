  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThe `tree` command is very useful for getting a clear understanding of a directory structure.  It would be great if this command was ported to PowerShell as `Format-Tree` so it could be integrated with `System.IO.FileSystemInfo`.  It would be even better if this command worked generically with string inputs and a scriptblock parameter, like a recursive `Group-Object` with `tree` formatting, though I'm unsure how this scenario would ideally be implemented.\r\n",
