  "body": "Some CIM needed types were not included in the PowerShell core types white list preventing the CimCmdlets module commands from running in a ConstrainedLanguage PowerShell.\n\nFix is to add the missing types to the white list.  Fix also includes modifying the dot source check to allow script that only implements PowerShell commands, which allows the CimCmdlets module to load in ConstrainedLanguage mode.\n",
