  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nShould Compiled Powershell Commandlets be able call other PSCmdlets from within the same session.\r\n\r\nSo the problem first arose when I was trying to call another Known PSCmdlet from a module I am building. In this scenario the idea was to create an object \r\n\r\nWriteHostCommand cmd = new WriteHostCommand();\r\ncmd.Object = \"Hello world\";\r\ncmd.ForeGroundColor = ConsoleColor.Cyan;\r\ncmd.Invoke();\r\n\r\n\"An error occurred while enumerating through a collection: Cmdlets derived from PSCmdlet cannot be invoked directly.\"\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThe idea behind this premise is as Powershell Commands become increasingly capable. Modules written in C# looses the ability to rapidly prototype for Powershell commandlets. \r\n\r\nThe idea would be to allow Invoke to function.. with a Property for a SessionState. \r\n\r\nThoughts?",
