  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nEssentially this issue: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/4622\r\n\r\n> You would expect these two to \"speak the same language\".\r\n> \r\n> Get-LocalGroupMember outputs 'COMPUTERNAME\\username'\r\n> Get-LocalUser expects the format 'username', and doesn't understand the above.\r\n> \r\n> It would be nice if this simple incompatibility was resolved.\r\n\r\nIf you ask for a list of users in a group (Get-LocalGroupMember), and then for data about each user (Get-LocalUser), you would expect Get-LocalUser to understand the usernames you got from the group. But it expects you to strip the computer name first.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI would recommend to add a little check in Get-LocalUser that looks if names are prepended with the local computer name.",
