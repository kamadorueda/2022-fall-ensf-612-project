  "body": "See previous discussion for Windows at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7441. macOS icons follow https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/icons-and-images/app-icon/ which specifies icons should be rotated at 9 degrees. Currently the PS trapezoid is aligned flat and looks odd compared to other icons on the system.\r\n\r\nI don't have a mac, but I've committed a basic macOS version of the icon from #7441 (which follows the shape of the original) with a background and some gradients added. This might be a good start, but I don't own a Mac and I'm happy to let someone with more macOS skill take over.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/172594/44938678-3152f080-ad78-11e8-8827-00c0dd988282.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
