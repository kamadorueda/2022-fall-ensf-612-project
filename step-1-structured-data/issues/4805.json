      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT Could we have a conclusion from PowerShell committee? The Unix like formatting very problematic. It was acceptable in Windows PowerShell but in PowerShell Core it is confusing because users can get (out of PowerShell Core) native Unix formatting and one is different from PowerShell Core formatting.\r\nSo we could:\r\n1. Keep this as is for backward compatibility with Windows PowerShell.\r\n2. Make this formatting closer as possible to Unix original that PR brings. It may look still bad.\r\n3. Think about complex portable solution. I have not considered this particularly deeply, but so far I believe that this is not possible within existing Windows and Unix implementations. In particular, different Unix/Linux clones have different implementations.",
