The menu in your 2nd screenshot is something purely native to Windows that applies to any taskbar shortcuts and PowerShell has no knowledge or control over it.\r\nGiven that the JumpList does not give a UAC prompt, I'd say, it's something that we need to explicitly add in order to make it work for MSIX, the following blog post contains a possible solution\r\nhttps://www.advancedinstaller.com/allow-elevation-msix-packages.html",

      "body": "The purpose of the Jumplist is to be easier accessible and save 1 extra click and wait time for this slow submenu to appear. It was a backport of similar code from Windows PowerShell in C++ to C# in PowerShell Core. Therefore it ensures feature parity with Windows PowerShell and having the same user experience that people are used to. It is a highly used feature (as can be seen by the bug reports on it) and was extremely welcomed when it was added as many people missed it.",
