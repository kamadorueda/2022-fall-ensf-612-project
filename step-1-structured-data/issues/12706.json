      "body": "Where this is of concern to me is if the History file uses FIFO and starts removing entries once the Max has been reached, there is a potential for data loss that someone may not expect if they have extended the Max value. I have not tested the effect of shrinking the Max value below the size of the History file contents to see if that is the actual behavior.",
