Witness that each line takes several seconds to paste, and a full script locks the console for several minutes while the paste is \"typing\"\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nIt should be fast\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nIt is incredibly slow\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.1\r\nOS                             Linux 4.18.0-13-generic #14-Ubuntu SMP Wed Dec 5 09:04:24 UTC 2018\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
