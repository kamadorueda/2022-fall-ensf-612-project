      "body": "This seems to work for me on 7.2 at least. Is your user profile loaded for your unelevated process? If it isn't then `$env:TEMP` will be using `C:\\Windows\\TEMP` which as you've said the user won't have write access to. Best check in your unelevated process what the value of `$env:TEMP`, `$env:TMP`, and `$env:USERPROFILE` are.",

      "body": "Yea that doesn't sounds right to me, I'm unsure why it is actually set to that. You can see how it affects what temp dir is used\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/144151461-6e840a9a-48b5-426b-a359-d494d4d4297b.png)\r\n\r\nMost likely PowerShell is using the .NET function which it uses the Win32 function [GetTempPath](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-gettemppathw). The docs there show how `TMP` is used as the first lookup value for what this should return. The temp path is used to store the proxy module scripts that define how pwsh talks to WinPS for the Appx module calls.\r\n\r\nIn the end you should look into what might be setting `TMP` to `C:\\Windows\\TEMP`, be it an explicit user env var, parent process, something else to fix this problem.",
