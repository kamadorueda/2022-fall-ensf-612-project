  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nPowerShell serialization has a list of known PowerShell types.  When an object is deserialized containing a known type it tries to deserialize the object to that specific type and throws exception if it can't succeed.  SemanticVersion only exists in PSCore6 so when remoting from Windows PowerShell or importing clixml generated from PSCore6 that contains SemanticVersion, it fails.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6448\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1819\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

Problem solved, perfectly!",
