  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nHave a script that creates the symlinks and have one package, which you would run as root.\r\n\r\n* could be run manually (for tar packages)\r\n* or as a post script on the package (in deb and RPM)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Alternative proposal\r\n\r\nConsolidate deb packages into 3 packages by the libSSL libmi expects in the package:\r\n\r\n1. powershell_7.1.2-1.libssl.1.0.0_amd64.deb \r\n   * All others (link to libssl may be broken to prevent worse problems in libmi)\r\n2. powershell_7.1.2-1.libssl.1.0.2_amd64.deb\r\n   * Debian 9 \r\n3. powershell_7.1.2-1.libssl.1.1.0_amd64.deb\r\n   * Debian 10 and 11\r\n\r\n",

The question still remains, if it\u2019s just libmi that needs the OpenSSL link then why do you have it for different versions. The last time I checked you still package the OpenSSL 1.0.x library linked version.",
