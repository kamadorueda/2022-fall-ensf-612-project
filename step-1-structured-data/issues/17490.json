  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI installed pwsh.exe on a custom path on my production server (C:\\apps\\sdk\\pwsh\\7\\) and I used explicit paths to pwsh.exe in scheduled tasks. After a windows update this weekend, the update for Powershell uninstalled powershell and installed it in the default path (C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\) by itself. This caused several scheduled tasks to stop.\r\n\r\nIs this behavior by design?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nInstallation path should be preserved\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nInstallation path changed\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### OS Data\n\n```powershell\nVersion    Caption\r\n-------    -------\r\n10.0.17763 Microsoft Windows Server 2019 Standard\n```\n\n\n### Windows update log\n\n```markdown\ntbd\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

As the option to alter the path for `pwsh` is made available in the installer, I assumed that this would not cause problems. I don't mind using the default path but I suggest removing the option for a customized path until this bug can be fixed as it seem inevitable that this issue will occur with others.",

I'll monitor this over the next few days.",

Can/will this change? Is a question that I think is outside the scope of the PowerShell Team to answer however they can continue conversations with the Microsoft Update team around this.",
