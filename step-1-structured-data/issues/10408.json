  "body": "This is related to a longstanding issue with PowerShell that recently was brought up in a discussion on [PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC#215](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/215).\r\n\r\nConsider the following 10 object types:\r\n\r\n`System.Management.Automation.DebugRecord`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.InformationRecord`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.VerboseRecord`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.WarningRecord`\r\n`Deserialized.System.Management.Automation.DebugRecord`\r\n`Deserialized.System.Management.Automation.VerboseRecord`\r\n`Deserialized.System.Management.Automation.WarningRecord`\r\n`System.Exception`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord`\r\n`System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock`\r\n\r\nWhen you are working with any of those types as _captured data_ (i.e. not as data that is streamed something other than standard output, but as something that you captured in a variable and are outputting in your terminal), if you pipe an instance of any of those types to `Format-Table`, `Format-List`, `Format-Wide`, or `Format-Custom`, you will still be presented with their default (custom) format unless you use the `-Force` parameter that is common to the `Format-*` cmdlets.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour, which has been in PowerShell since version 1, is unexpected. If you pipe data to a specific `Format-*` cmdlet, you expect that data to be shown in that format without having to `-Force` it.\r\n\r\nThe problem with `OutOfBand` is that the way PowerShell is programmed today, the `-Force` parameter is required to override the `OutOfBand` default output for a given type. That behaviour is the crux of this issue.\r\n\r\nI'm currently investigating what can be done, if anything, to allow these types to use the requested format without requiring `-Force`.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-FormatScriptBlock {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    Write-Verbose -Verbose -Message 'This function outputs a bunch of OutOfBand types.'\r\n    {Write-Output 'This is a script block'}\r\n    Write-Warning 'This might not function quite the way you think'\r\n    Get-Process -Id 1234321231\r\n    Write-Debug -Debug -Message 'Debugging is fun!'\r\n    {'This is another script block'}\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction Test-FormatError {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    Get-Item -LiteralPath DoesNotExist -ErrorVariable myError -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\r\n    Write-Information -MessageData 'This outputs an error.' -InformationAction Continue\r\n    $myError\r\n    Write-Information -MessageData 'All done.' -InformationAction Continue\r\n}\r\n\r\nTest-FormatScriptBlock | Format-List *\r\nTest-FormatError | Format-List *\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nVERBOSE: This function outputs a

      "body": "Of all the 10 types listed above, one question keeps coming back to me: why `System.Management.Automation.ScriptBlock`?\r\n\r\nI understand why script blocks would have a custom format, so that you could see their contents as string by default. But what I don't understand is why the custom `scriptblock` format would be configured with `outOfBand: true`.\r\n\r\nAll of the other 9 types are related to non-standard output stream information, where you want the data to be shown using the custom format so that it can render properly even when in the middle of other data being output by a script or function. That makes sense, and it looks we can preserve that behavior while allowing stored objects of those types to be formatted the way users want them formatted. But `scriptblock` is the oddball in this set of types, so if you can share details or background explaining why it's configured with `outOfBand: true`, that would be useful information to know.",

If you want to capture errors to look at them in a specific way, you wouldn't want to do that as part of a single command because PowerShell formatting doesn't handle incompatible heterogeneous types very well for anything but `Format-List` (which is the format it falls back to when it discovers an object that is not a value type or a string that doesn't support the current view). Instead you should use `-ErrorVariable` to capture errors in a command so that you can format them a certain way independent of the command you invoked that produced those errors.",
