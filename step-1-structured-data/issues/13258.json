We still need to keep this class around because it's part of PS 5.1 and 7.0, and thus we will have to keep updating it to avoid confusion to reading the code.\r\n\r\n> in any case they have to make many changes in code\r\n\r\nWhy would you assume this? It's very possible the user code has a visitor derives from `DefaultCustomVisitor` which doesn't need to change at all with new addition of AST types. `SymbolResolvePostActionVisitor` is a good example of it. ~I don't have to change it, but only for completeness.~ I reverted my changes to `SymbolResolvePostActionVisitor`.",
