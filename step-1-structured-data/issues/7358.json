The information you shared is sufficient for future PowerShell users run into this case.\r\n\r\nI also used `Remove-Service` cmdlet in PowerShell Core 6 to remove the `SshdBroker` service, which also removed the error when running `Get-Service` in PowerSell Core 6.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> Remove-Service -Name SshdBroker -Verbose\r\nVERBOSE: Performing the operation \"Remove-Service\" on target \"SshdBroker (SshdBroker)\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nLawrence",

      "body": "You should not need to reinstall Windows to fix this issue. You just need to remove the service from the affected systems.\r\n\r\nAssuming they are domain joined, then one solution would be to create a startup script that checks to see if the broker service exists on the computer, and if so, removes it. Combine that with a WMI filter that only runs said script if and only if the broker service is on the system. After a few days, all hosts would be resolved, You could add a bit of telemetry to the script to report back each host on which the script was run to confirm the service removal. I wish I was better with WMI filters to tap one out. But you get the idea and no doubt Google can assist with the details.\r\n",
