(Nevermind, I looked at the PR).\r\n\r\nSo you can definitely add properties in the TypeData as CodeProperty (resulting in a lazy load, but still C# evaluation) instead of adding them as pre-calculated NoteProperty ... There is no question of whether that's \"ok\" (To implement the property as a static on a helper class). I'd say, if TypeData properties work for output from provider cmdlets, then it makes sense to me to do it that way!\r\n\r\nI think to get the full picture of perf. you'd need to test it piping through other commands, since so many of them use the PSPath property, for instance `get-childitem | get-item` ... or something.\r\n",
