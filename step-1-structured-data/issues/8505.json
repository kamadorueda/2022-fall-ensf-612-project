      "body": "@iSazonov What do you mean by merging them? Having a single `.cs` file that contains the type definitions for both? I don't think that alone will affect the perf, so there should be more that Jason wanted.\r\nI did looked at the CPU time trace with the IL assemblies when working on the startup perf, and the huge `yield` methods in those 2 files does take an outstanding amount of the CPU time, over 2%. But the data is from IL assemblies and thus I'm not sure if it's really an issue with crossgen'ed assemblies. I couldn't generate PDBs for crossgen'ed assemblies.\r\n\r\nI haven't contact .NET Core team on the crossgen related issues/questions. I moved to something with higher priority.",
