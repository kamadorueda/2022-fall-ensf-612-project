  "body": "This switches from UTF8 to Unicode per #712 (and adds tests).\n\nWe're not totally sold on using Unicode over UTF8, as it means using output from `base64` on Linux will fail with `-EncodedCommand`. But not using Unicode means this feature does not work the same as on Windows.\n\nAs it stands, this PR resolves the code to act the same as PowerShell's [original behavior](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/hostifaces/PowerShellProcessInstance.cs#L98).\n",
