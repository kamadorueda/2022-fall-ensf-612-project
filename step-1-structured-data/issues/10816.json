      "body": "While startup time is generally a concern for PowerShell, it is most important in _non-interactive_ scenarios: CLI-based execution with `-File` or `-Command`.\r\n\r\nFor predictability, it is best to use `-NoProfile` in these cases, which bypasses loading of the profiles.\r\n(Sadly, unlike POSIX-like shells, Powershell by default loads its profiles even when `-File` or `-Command` are used - see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/8072 and https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/992#issuecomment-334965306 for the backstory )\r\n\r\nIn _interactive_ use, where you do want profiles loaded, the slowdown is noticeable, but doesn't strike me as dramatic; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> { pwsh -nop -c 'get-module' }, { pwsh -nop -c 'set-alias a b; get-module'} | % { (Measure-Command $_).TotalSeconds }\r\n\r\n0.472155\r\n0.6102869\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, the implicit loading of the `Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility` module triggered by the `Set-Alias` call (plus the `Set-Alias` call itself) increased the startup time by about 30% on my macOS 10.15 machine.\r\n\r\nGiven how many basic cmdlets live in said module, it's quite likely that the average profile triggers its import - and once it is imported, using other commands from it doesn't cause additional delays.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
