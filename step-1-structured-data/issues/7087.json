  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\n`DotNetAdapter.GetMembers<T>(object obj)` returns dynamic members for an object that implements `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`, however, `DotNetAdapter.GetMember<T>(object obj, string memberName)` doesn't include dynamic members. I believe this makes sense and thus update the comment to clarify it in the code.\r\n\r\nBe noted that, `GetMember<T>(object obj, string memberName)` doesn't return `Event` members either, while `GetMembers<T>(object obj)` does.\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\nThe question about this was raised in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6898#discussion_r194849375. After investigation, I found it's because `DotNetAdapter.GetMember<T>(object obj, string memberName)` doesn't return dynamic members, and thus submit this PR to call it out in the code comments.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
