  "body": "Note: The existing behavior can't be changed so as not to break backward compatibility; there are two possible ways forward:\r\n\r\n* Live with the limitation and simply document it - it's definitely an edge case.  \r\nHowever, this means that the count of input collections with `$null` values will be technically incorrect and deviate from manual counting with something like `$count=0; 1, $null, 2 | % { ++$count }; $count`\r\n\r\n* Introduce an `-IncludeNull` switch that also counts `$null` values among the inputs, and treats them as `0` in the context of  `-Average` and `-StandardDeviation` and `-Min` / `-Max`.\r\n\r\n### Current behavior:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> 1, $null, 2 | Measure-Object -AllStats\r\n\r\nCount             : 2\r\nAverage           : 1.5\r\nSum               : 3\r\nMaximum           : 2\r\nMinimum           : 1\r\nStandardDeviation : 0.707106781186548\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Potential new behavior:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Hypothetical new -IncludeNull switch\r\nPS> 1, $null, 2 | Measure-Object -AllStats -IncludeNull\r\n\r\n\r\nCount             : 3\r\nAverage           : 1\r\nSum               : 3\r\nMaximum           : 2\r\nMinimum           : 0\r\nStandardDeviation : 1\r\nProperty          : \r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, the above would behave like `1, 0, 2 | Measure-Object -AllStats`\r\n\r\n",
