  "body": "CrossGen'ed assemblies cause a hang to happen intermittently when running powershell class basic parsing tests in Linux/OSX. The hang seems to happen when generating dynamic assemblies.\r\nThis issue has been reported to CoreCLR team. We need to work around it for now because the Travis CI build failures caused by this is draining our builder resource and severely affect our daily work. The workaround is:\r\n  1. For pull request and push commit, build without '-CrossGen' and run the parsing tests\r\n  2. For nightly build, build with '-CrossGen' but don't run the parsing tests\r\n\r\nWith this workaround, CI builds triggered by pull request and push commit will exercise the parsing tests with IL assemblies, while nightly builds will exercise CrossGen'ed assemblies without running those class parsing tests so as to avoid the hang.\r\nNOTE: this change should be reverted once the 'CrossGen' issue is fixed by CoreCLR. The CoreCLR issue is https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/9745.",
