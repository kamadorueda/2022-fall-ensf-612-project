LanguageMode was set to ConstrainedLanguage and __PSLockdownPolicy set to 4.\r\n\r\n$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode\r\nConstrainedLanguage\r\n$Env:__PSLockdownPolicy\r\n4\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n1. Where and who can I found set this?\r\n2. How to revert it back? \r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\n$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode show to Fulllanguage and $Env:__PSLockdownPolicy show be null.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nLanguageMode was set to ConstrainedLanguage and __PSLockdownPolicy set to 4.\r\nMost scripts can't run.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\n$ExecutionContext.SessionState.LanguageMode=\"FullLanguage\"\r\nInvalidOperation: Cannot set property. Property setting is supported only on core types in this language mode.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n$PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
