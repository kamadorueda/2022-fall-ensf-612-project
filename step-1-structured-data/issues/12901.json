  "body": "On Windows we can set Hidden flag in file/folder attributes.\r\nSince .Net 5.0 this is supported for BSD-like OS-es (MacOS, FreeBSD)\r\nhttps://manpages.debian.org/buster/freebsd-manpages/chflags.2freebsd.en.html\r\n\r\nBut it does not work on Linux. Currently PowerShell silently accepts Hidden flag - that is very amazing behavior: if an user sets the flag without error the user expects that the flag really is on the file/folder but it is not.\r\n\r\n.Net tracking issue https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/37301\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(Get-Item testfile).Attributes = 'Hidden'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThrow unsupported exception.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nSilently pass but follow check shows that the file/folder has not the Hidden flag.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\npwsh 7.1 Preview3\r\n```\r\n",
