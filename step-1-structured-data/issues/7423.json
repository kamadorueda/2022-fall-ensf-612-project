  "body": "First of all, users of PowerShell 5 (and 3 and 4) need markdown commands too. Additionally, this steps on **multiple** third party modules that already exist and *are* backward compatible.\r\n\r\nFinally, I'm really not sure why we need commands for markdown in PowerShell anyway.\r\n\r\nI mean, I get that you want to use markdown stuff for help, but **obviously** you're not expecting people to get help by doing:  \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Env:PSModulePath -split [IO.Path]::PathSeparator | \r\nGet-ChildItem -recurse -filter *.md | \r\nGet-Content | Select-String MyHelpSearch |\r\nConvertFrom-Markdown -asVt100 | \r\nShow-Markdown\r\n```\r\n\r\nGiven all that, and the obviously limited Markdown that you can render in the console, there's no need to ship generic markdown cmdlets in the core -- but if you did need them, you should either use an existing third party module, or build your own and ship it to the gallery, not put them in Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility",

Additional work in 6.2 timeframe to have this work end-to-end.\r\n\r\nThe longer term plan is to [decouple all modules from PS Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1979).",
