  "body": "It would be great if I could use a primitive grep call to pipe text data into it.\r\nCurrently there is the possibility to run:\r\n$(command) |  where {$_ -match 'pattern'}\r\nwhich is basically doing what I am searching for from the functional point of view.\r\nAs I - and many other developers have memorized Unix commands, a support of:\r\n$(command) |  grep 'pattern'\r\nwould reduce the amount of time to get into Powershell usage.\r\n\r\nMany commands already provide a similar syntax to the unix shell like ls and rm by wrapping native Powershell commands. It would be very much appreciated if you could extend the list.\r\n\r\nIn Linux environments it may be still useful to be able to use a native grep somehow, as it may still be more flexible or not all flags may be supported in the Powershell equivalent. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
