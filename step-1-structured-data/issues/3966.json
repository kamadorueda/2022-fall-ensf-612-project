  "body": "fix for #3912 \r\n\r\nThis improves the performance of the listener by not relying on a new\r\nprocess starting up to run the listener. It improves the debugability\r\nof tests by providing more direct access to the session executing\r\nthe listener. It also reverses the blocking nature of starting the\r\nlistener. By default, Start-HttpListener will no longer block, you need\r\nto use -Foreground to have Start-HttpListener block. Lastly, create\r\na way to catch errors if the listener has a problem. If code in the\r\nlistener throws, it emits an error record.\r\n\r\nfix the tests which use the listener\r\n",
