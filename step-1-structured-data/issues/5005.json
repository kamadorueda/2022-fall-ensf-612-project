  "body": "Test service had a delay of 5s while the test had a timeout of 5s, there's a small window where the delay expires before the timeout invalidating the test.\r\nFix is to increase the delay to 6s allowing for the timeout to succeed.\r\n\r\nVSCode removed a bunch of trailing whitespace.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
