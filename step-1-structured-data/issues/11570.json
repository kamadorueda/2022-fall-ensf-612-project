  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThis was brought up in the PR https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/11552 to expand `~` for PATH making it consistent with BASH and resolving an issue with dotnet global tools which adds a path starting with `~` to PATH.  `~` expansion is done by the shell and not the OS, so this can lead to unexpected behavior if this isn't understood.  From that perspective, it seems that using `~` as shortcut to refer to `$HOME` is ok for interactive use, but probably not recommended for system config changes as other shells may not support it.\r\n\r\nFrom that perspective, it may not make sense to use it for `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` nor `PSModulePath`, but I can also see an argument that developers may want to use this during development rather than an absolute path.  Thoughts?\r\n",

Testing a console app from PowerShell and having `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` *appear* to not carry over into the child process would be a pain to debug.",

Seems wrong to me just to have consistency across the `PATH` env vars.  In the case of `PATH` and `PSModulePath`, the expansion is internal to pwsh.",
