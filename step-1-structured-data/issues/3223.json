  "body": "Related: #9497\r\n\r\nWhile `pwsh -Command -` and `pwsh -File -` both accept command input from the pipeline / from stdin:\r\n\r\n* they **exhibit undesirable pseudo-interactive behavior**:\r\n\r\n  * they execute each line _one by one_, in _separate pipelines_.\r\n       * additionally, `-File -` prints the prompt string and each input line before the output \r\n\r\n  * they require pipelines that are spread across multiple lines  for readability to be terminated with _two_ newlines (see below) - as would be necessary _interactively_, if `PSReadLine` weren't loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n* they **do not support combining `-` input with  passing _arguments_**:\r\n\r\n  * While that limitation is documented for `-Command -` (`-File -` is undocumented altogether), there's no good reason for this limitation, and it limits the usefulness of the construct.\r\n\r\n  * While you could (but in my mind shouldn't) argue that `-Command -` should be limited to providing a self-contained source-code snippet that doesn't expect arguments, at the least <br>`-File -` should support passing arguments by placing them after the `-` - after all, you want to be able to pass arguments to a _script_ - whether that script is specified as a a _file_ or as a script's _content_ via stdin.\r\n\r\nThus, the following command, which spreads pipeline `\"hi\" |  % { \"$_ there\" }`  across _two_ lines -  does _not_ work:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n@'\r\n\"in\"\r\n\"hi\" |\r\n  % { \"$_ there\" }\r\n\"out\"\r\n'@ | powershell -noprofile -command -\r\n```\r\nThe above yields _only_ `in`, because the end of the multi-line command is never detected, causing it to be _quietly ignored_.\r\n\r\nAs evidence that this happens in the real world, see [this Stack Overflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/a/42475326/45375), whose accepted answer provides more detail.\r\n\r\nInserting an empty line after the multi-line command fixes the problem:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n@'\r\n\"in\"\r\n\"hi\" |\r\n  % { \"$_ there\" }\r\n\r\n\"out\"\r\n'@ | powershell -noprofile -command -\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above now yields `in`, `hi there` and `out` - that is, the multi-line pipeline was correctly submitted due to the extra newline, as was the single-line statement afterwards.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nSummary:\r\n\r\n* Both `File -` and `-Command -` should be fixed; and, on Unix `/dev/stdin` should be the same as passing `-`.\r\n\r\n* **If `-File -` worked properly, there'd really be no need for `-Command -`**.\r\n  * _Update_: Except perhaps for emulating an interactive REPL via stdin - see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/15331#issuecomment-830652350\r\n\r\n* `-File -` should optionally also accepted _arguments_.\r\n\r\n",
