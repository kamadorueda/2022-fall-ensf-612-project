      "body": "Hi @iSazonov \r\n```\r\nThe recommended way of writing an output file from a zip archive entry is to:\r\n\r\n1. Use Path.Combine(destinationDirectory, archiveEntry.FullName) to determine the raw output path.\r\n2. Use Path.GetFullPath(..) on the raw output path to resolve any directory traversal elements.\r\n3. Use Path.GetFullPath(destinationDirectory + Path.DirectorySeparatorChar) to determine the fully resolved path of the destination directory.\r\n4. Validate that the resolved output path StartsWith the resolved destination directory, aborting if this is not true.\r\n```\r\nThe recommendation is to do 1, 2, 3 and 4, not only 1. `Path.Combine` does not perform any sanitization of the entry full path \r\n\r\nCheers",
