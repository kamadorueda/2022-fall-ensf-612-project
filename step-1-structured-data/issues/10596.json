  "body": "Considering the ternary operator was added using the syntax most friendly to c# developers and not general PowerShell users - i.e all your admin users,\r\n\r\nI propose that the ternary operator should be further extended to also allow -then -else syntax\r\n\r\nMy reason for asking is simple - there are still many in the PowerShell community that want & prefer the verboseness of the language over other languages and find that the verboseness provides a much easier readability experience.\r\n\r\nPowerShell is known for allowing users to pick syntax options that they are comfortable and giving `-then -else` syntax would help bring the ternary operator to those users, that don't come from the classical developer type roles.",

      "body": "That's true, as well. My only concern for using `-then`/`-else` syntax for a ternary operator is that it creates an exception in the language rules.\r\n\r\nAll other operators with `-operator` syntax are purely binary operators. While they may have multiple arguments on their LHS or RHS, they _only_ have a LHS and RHS argument. None of them have a third argument.\r\n\r\nFrom a newbie's perspective, `$a -then $b -else $c` looks pretty similar to `$a -eq $b -as $c` (or any other consecutive sequence of operators; they're not super common, but also not unheard of). This creates a pitfall in terms of the expectation of what an `-operator` does and how it should work. The ternary syntax is a completely different mode of operation than all existing operators using this syntax.\r\n\r\nThe expectation we currently have for an `-operator` is:\r\n\r\n> $LHS -operator $RHS # creates some definite result that can be further operated on\r\n\r\nExtending this to the proposed syntax creates a false assumption:\r\n\r\n> `$a -then $b` and `$a -else $b` are also valid syntaxes, and `$a -then $b -else $c` is just an extended variant of these.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying this is a hard-line \"we should under no circumstances do this\", but I would think that given the proposal is to create, effectively, a \"clearer\" version of the ternary syntax, we should probably avoid creating a behaviour that is easily misunderstood based on currently reasonable assumptions about how the language patterns behave.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_That said_, there's a fairly easy solution here: implement `-then` and `-else` as separate operators, which can then be combined to create this ternary syntax.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# if $a is truthy, returns $b, otherwise returns $null\r\n$a -then $b \r\n\r\n# if $a is not null, returns $a, otherwise returns $b\r\n$a -else $b \r\n\r\n# if a is truthy, returns $b; otherwise the first operation is evaluated, \r\n# leaving us with: $null -else $c, which then returns $c\r\n$a -then $b -else $c \r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has a bonus effect: `$a -else $b` then becomes an analogue to C#'s `a ?? b` syntax, and you can utilise `-then` as another null-coalescing operator: `$a -then $a.Property` or `$a -and $a.Property -then $a.Property.SubProperty`\r\n\r\nI'm not especially fond of `-then`/`-else` as being implemented in precisely the same way as the current ternary operator. I don't like introducing exceptions to established and presently well-defined language rules if we can help it.\r\n\r\nTL;DR: I'm in favor of it as long as `$a -then $b` and `$a -else $c` don't create parse errors, essentially.",

      "body": "Someone in the PowerShell Discord brought up one potential issue with my above idea:\r\n```powershell\r\n$true -then $null -else $someValue\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf implemented as separate operators... this could be a potential pitfall if it is not handled carefully by the parser. Ternary syntaxes should return `$null` in that kind of case (`$true ? $null : $value` will return `$null`) but if the operators are completely independent it's possible that `-else` could be mistakenly triggered. \r\n\r\nI still think that's the best way to proceed, but we'd need to add a special case somewhere in the logic to also skip an immediately following `-else` if the `-then` condition passes, even if the positive result of the `-then` is in fact `$null`.\r\n\r\nMind you, I'm not sure that's a _likely_ occurrence, since `$a -then $null` will _always_ result in null; it's rather a pointless operation. However, it's conceivable that in any given `$a -then $b` statement, `$b` could potentially be $null by accident, if not on purpose.\r\n\r\n(also, edited the above to clarify the proposed behaviour of `-else` as I made an error there)",

I think that's the most logical way for them to operate. Essentially the same as `-and` and `-or`, but returning the value rather than the boolean coercion of that value.\r\n\r\nI don't see any particular composition of that as a pitfall, just a regular result of left-associative operator parsing.\r\n\r\nI think the value of these operators is in being able to pass out a meaningful result in a truthy situation, but stop an error in a falsey situation:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nreturn $item -then $item.Transform()\r\n```",

Plus, I am quite worried about adding new operators since PowerShell already has some arguably messed up precedence, see `1 -or 1 -and 0` or `1, 2 + 3, 4`. How should something like `$a ? $b : $c -then $d -else $e` be parsed? `($a ? $b : $c) -then $d -else $e` or `$a ? $b : ($c -then $d -else $e)`? What about the other way around: `$a -then $b -else $c ? $d : $e`? The only way I could see solving it is by making `-then` and `-else` aliases for `?` and `:` respectively, though that opens up questions whether mixing the two with `$x ? $y -else $z` and `$x -then $y -else $z` should be allowed - probably not.",
