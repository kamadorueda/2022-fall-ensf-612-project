There are some steps in Linux to follow to make work.\r\n\r\nAlso, is this Linux box part of the Windows AD domain?  Or, just a workgroup box?\r\n\r\nThere are some missing information needed in order to understand your issue.\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't work for Microsoft, I'm just an MVP and would love to assist you. \r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n",
