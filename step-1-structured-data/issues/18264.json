  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWhen I run the cmdlet `New-LocalUser` with the `-NoPassword` flag it throws an error rather than creating a user.\r\n\r\nI tried adding the type using `Add-Type -TypeDefinition $TelemetrySource -Language CSharp` with various combinations of the source code that matches the referenced types, in an attempt to remediate, but it didn't help.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nNew-LocalUser MyUser -NoPassword\r\n$user = Get-LocalUser MyUser\r\nWrite-Host \"My user = $($user.Name)\"\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nNew-LocalUser MyUser -NoPassword\r\nNew-LocalUser: Could not load type 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Telemetry.Internal.TelemetryAPI' from assembly 'System.Management.Automation, Version=7.2.6.500, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNew-LocalUser: Could not load type 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Telemetry.Internal.TelemetryAPI' from assembly 'System.Management.Automation, Version=7.2.6.500, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22621\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "It looks like a regression in the `Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts` module that ships in Windows.\r\nSome changes were pushed to this module which depends on the `TelemetryAPI` type from Windows PowerShell. This type doesn't exist in PowerShell Core, and hence the error.\r\n\r\nWe will contact the owner team of the the `Microsoft.PowerShell.LocalAccounts` module about this.",
