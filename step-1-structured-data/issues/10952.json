  "body": "When I originally wrote up the proposal for `-AsArray` in #6327, I meant it to work like `@(...)`:\r\n\r\nThat is, the input should be converted to an array (and serialized as such) _unless it already is one_.\r\n\r\nInstead, `-AsArray`, as currently implemented, _unconditionally_ treats the input as an array.\r\n\r\nWith _pipeline_ input, which automatically gets enumerated, that usually makes no difference, but it does when you pass the inputs as an  _argument_.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nConvertTo-Json -AsArray 1 -Compress | Should -Be '[1]'\r\nConvertTo-Json -AsArray 1,2 -Compress | Should -Be '[1,2]'\r\nConvertTo-Json -AsArray @() -Compress | Should -Be '[]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe last 2 tests fail, because they wrap the already array-valued input in an _extra_ array:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected length: 5 Actual length:   7 Strings differ at index 1. \r\nExpected: '[1,2]'\r\nBut was:  '[[1,2]]'\r\n\r\nExpected length: 5 Actual length:   7 Strings differ at index 1. \r\nExpected: '[]'\r\nBut was:  '[[]]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.5\r\n```\r\n",
