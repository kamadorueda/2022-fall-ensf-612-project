something to return access denied for some reason. There's no attempt to write to the file, it just opens the handle, sends some set commands to change attributes but no write request. This may be an issue for the .NET team because it's not just PowerShell.\r\n\r\nWhat is even more curious is this issue seems to be related to the `FileShare` value. I can run the same .NET functions from above successfully if I omit the `FileShare` parameter or set it to `None`. Adding even more confusion to the pot is that Samba seems to be setting all of the `FileShare` values on the actual SMB open packet so something might be up with the client side share logic it has. This will require further investigation to figure out how `FileShare` actually operates on Linux and how .NET passes along that information to the native syscalls, i.e. .NET -> Samba.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Issue 2 - Add/Set-Content silently fails\r\n\r\nUsing `Set-Content` instead also has some confusing behaviour, it will not output an error but these cmdlets will create the file if it doesn't exist but will not set the content.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> ls -al /mnt/test_smb/folder\r\ntotal 8\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean    0 May  4 06:56 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean 8192 May  4 06:26 ..\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> Set-Content /mnt/test_smb/folder/foo.txt \"foo\"\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> ls -al /mnt/test_smb/folder\r\ntotal 8\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean    0 May  4 06:57 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean 8192 May  4 06:26 ..\r\n-rwxr-xr-x. 1 jborean jborean    0 May  4 06:57 foo.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> ls -al /mnt/test_smb/folder\r\ntotal 8\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean    0 May  4 06:58 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean 8192 May  4 06:26 ..\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> Add-Content /mnt/test_smb/folder/foo.txt \"foo\"\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> ls -al /mnt/test_smb/folder\r\ntotal 8\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean    0 May  4 06:58 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean 8192 May  4 06:26 ..\r\n-rwxr-xr-x. 1 jborean jborean    0 May  4 06:58 foo.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo things seem to be ok but in reality the commands didn't work.\r\n\r\n## Issue 3 - Add/Set-Content does not close the file handle\r\n\r\nAt least with the example above, the SMB open is not closed when the commands are finished. This leaves a handle still opened on the SMB server causing issues when subsequent requests go to open the file with exclusive access or the file is deleted. Using the delete example we can see that the file isn't actually deleted until all the handles are closed (pwsh is closed/GC is collected)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> Set-Content /mnt/test_smb/folder/foo.txt \"value\"\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> ls -al /mnt/test_smb/folder/\r\ntotal 8\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean    0 May  4 07:04 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean 8192 May  4 06:26 ..\r\n-rwxr-xr-x. 1 jborean jborean    0 May  4 07:04 foo.txt\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> Remove-Item /mnt/test_smb/folder/foo.txt\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> ls -al /mnt/test_smb/folder/\r\ntotal 8\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean    0 May  4 07:04 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean 8192 May  4 06:26 ..\r\n-rwxr-xr-x. 0 jborean jborean    0 May  4 07:04 foo.txt\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> [GC]::Collect(); [GC]::WaitForPendingFinalizers()\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> ls -al /mnt/test_smb/folder/\r\ntotal 8\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean    0 May  4 07:05 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x. 2 jborean jborean 8192 May  4 06:26 ..\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see that the file is still present after the `Remove-Item` because the handle opened by `Set-Content` wasn't closed and it's only until the garbage collector has collected those handles that the file is actually deleted. Because this is dependent on when the GC runs you might get lucky and have it dispose of the handles relatively quickly but you cannot guarantee it will always run without explicitly calling it.\r\n\r\nThis can cause confusing errors if you try to then write to the file again that's still pending a delete\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> Set-Content /mnt/test_smb/folder/foo.txt \"value\"\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> Remove-Item /mnt/test_smb/folder/foo.txt\r\n\r\nPS /home/jborean/dev> Set-Content /mnt/test_smb/folder/foo.txt \"value\"\r\nSet-Content: Could not find file '/mnt/test_smb/folder/foo.txt'.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt states it couldn't find the file even though you want to create it with `Set-Content`. This is because the SMB response to opening that file returns `STATUS_DELETE_PENDING` because the original file still has a handle open to it (from the first `Set-Content` command).\r\n\r\nIt seems like there might be a stray handle in the code that `Add/Set-Content` calls that should be explicitly scoped with a `using (...)` where it is called.",
