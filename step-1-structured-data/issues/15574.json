It might happen if there's no space on the disk, or if the current user doesn't have permissions to the tmp folder.\r\n\r\nPowershell crashes with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nError: failed to execute \"pwsh\": Process terminated. The type initializer for 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Telemetry.ApplicationInsightsTelemetry' threw an exception.\r\n   at System.Environment.FailFast(System.String, System.Exception)\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.UnmanagedPSEntry.Start(System.String[], Int32)\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.ManagedPSEntry.Main(System.String[])\r\nSystem.TypeInitializationException: The type initializer for 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Telemetry.ApplicationInsightsTelemetry' threw an exception.\r\n ---> System.IO.IOException: The system cannot open the device or file specified. : 'CreateUniqueUserId'\r\n   at System.Threading.Mutex.CreateMutexCore(Boolean initiallyOwned, String name, Boolean& createdNew)\r\n   at System.Threading.Mutex..ctor(Boolean initiallyOwned, String name)\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.Telemetry.ApplicationInsightsTelemetry.GetUniqueIdentifier() in /PowerShell/src/System.Management.Automation/utils/Telemetry.cs:line 802\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.Telemetry.ApplicationInsightsTelemetry..cctor() in /PowerShell/src/System.Management.Automation/utils/Telemetry.cs:line 548\r\n   --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.Telemetry.ApplicationInsightsTelemetry.SendPSCoreStartupTelemetry(String mode) in /PowerShell/src/System.Management.Automation/utils/Telemetry.cs:line 656\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost.Start(String bannerText, String helpText) in /PowerShell/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ConsoleHost.cs:line 248\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.UnmanagedPSEntry.Start(String[] args, Int32 argc) in /PowerShell/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ManagedEntrance.cs:line 99\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis exception is thrown from Mutex ctor and isn't properly handled.
