If the `InputObject` is _not_ `IDictionary`, behaviour remains as per existing behaviour.\r\n1. If the `InputObject` **is** `IDictionary`:\r\n  - When pulling property names, we **only** check the dictionary's `Keys` _and_ any additional instance properties (e.g., those added with `Add-Member` or `Select-Object`)\r\n  - When looking for values, we first check the dictionary to see if the key is present. If it is, use the corresponding value. If it is not, we also check any instance properties with the same name and use those values if available.\r\n\r\nThe reason we also check for any instance properties is based on the assumption that if a user is adding extra properties to their IDictionary objects, they likely want to keep them as intact as possible.\r\n\r\nWe do however ignore standard properties completely, since with IDictionary objects these are typically of little value when serialized to string.\r\n\r\nNote that since both Export-Csv and ConvertTo-Csv utilise the same helper methods, tests were only added to the ConvertTo-Csv test file in order to minimise the duplication of code.\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n![Example of ConvertTo-Csv with hashtables as input, then again with instance properties attached to the hashtable.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/511027662915895307/642919632683925515/unknown.png)\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nResolves #10999 \r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] Issue filed: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/5104\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
