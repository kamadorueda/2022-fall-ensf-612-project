Then run `Install-Module -Name Posh-SSH` which will fail with exception `Could not find a part of the path`.\n## Expected behavior\n\nEither users who are not root nor member of the wheel group should be able to install Modules via `Install-Module` or if, for security reasons, installing modules should only be allowed to the root user or members of the wheel group, then `Install-Module` should fail with a hint that root privileges are required.\n## Actual behavior\n\n``` powershell\nPS /Users/ffeldhaus> Install-Module -Name Posh-SSH                                                                      \n\nUntrusted repository\n     PackageManagement\\Install-Package : Could not find a part of the path                                              \n'/usr/local/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0-alpha.10/Modules/Posh-SSH/1.7.6'.                                                \nAt /usr/local/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0-alpha.10/Modules/PowerShellGet/PSModule.psm1:1711 char:21                      \n+ ...          $null = PackageManagement\\Install-Package @PSBoundParameters \n+                      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                                                 \n+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (Microsoft.Power....InstallPackage:InstallPackage) [Install-Package], Exception\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.IO.DirectoryNotFoundException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.CopyItemCommand,Microsoft.PowerShell.PackageManagement.Cmdlets.InstallPackage\n```\n## Environment data\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\nPS /Users/ffeldhaus>  $PSVersionTable                                                                                   \n\nName                           Value                                                                                   \n----                           -----                                                                                   \nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha                                                                             \nPSEdition                      Core                                                                                    \nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                 \nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0                                                                                 \nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.10                                                                         \nCLRVersion                                                                                                             \nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                     \nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                     \nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n```\n",

Log on to the computer with an account that has Administrator rights,\nand then try again, or install 'C:\\Users\\Dustin\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules' by adding \"-Scope\nCurrentUser\" to your command. You can also try running the Windows PowerShell session with elevated\nrights (Run as Administrator).\n```\n\nOut of curiosity, does `Install-Module -Scope CurrentUser <module>` work? That is the idiomatic way to install a module without root privileges.\n",

Interestingly, `Uninstall-Module` run as a non root user when the module was installed by a root user gives the following warning followed by an exception which points to missing permissions:\n\n``` powershell\nWARNING: The version '1.7.6' of module 'Posh-SSH' is currently in use. Retry the operation after closing the \napplications.\nPackageManagement\\Uninstall-Package : Module 'Posh-SSH' is in currently in use or you don't have the required \npermissions.\n```\n\nI would suggest to implement a similar warning for `Install-Module` as shown in Windows PowerShell to close this isssue.\n",

      "body": "In this case, it should only be restricted to those with write access to the modules directory. Any user/group membership check would fail to paint the full picture.\n\nA system administrator could set the module directory to be owned by `root:netusers` and give it `g=rwx` permissions. That way, all `netusers` group members would be able to install modules, regardless of whether they were actually the system administrator.\n\nThe `access` syscall would help here (example in C):\n\n``` c\nif (0 == access(MODULE_DIRECTORY, W_OK)) {\n    // module installation is allowed\n}\n```\n",
