  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nWould be great if $PSVersionTable could include some more relevant information to its' environment. For instance:\r\n\r\n## OS agnostic\r\n\r\n* [New key] .NET version built upon\r\n* [New key] OS Architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64 etc.)\r\n* [New key] Process architecture (x64, x86, ARM, ARM64 etc.)\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\n* [Existing key] Update \"OS\" key to include build number (cumulative)\r\n* [Existing key] Update \"OS\" key to include edition (Home / Pro / Enterprise)\r\n  * If someone can't get BitLocker cmdlets to work, but running Windows 10 Home.. :)\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\nI'm thinking suggested additions in addition to being useful for end users, might be helpful when adding ```$PSVersionTable``` to issues on GitHub too, to give some more context out of the box.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nAdd more keys and more info to existing keys, to the hashtable that is $PSVersionTable.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6450056/159868335-850b87c3-97cb-4606-89a6-4c68474716de.png)\r\n",
