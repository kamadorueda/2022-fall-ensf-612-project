  "body": "Since it's very typical for distributions to provide the source code in src rpm format (for rpm based) distributions and also all its dependencies so that you can do rpmbuild of the .src.rpm to generate the .rpm. That will be a requirement if we ever want to see powershell be distributed by the likes of centos,fedora, (also rhel) since the build system and all is based on a build rpm from src to rpm.\n\nso this means that we have to start with the dot net rpm, have src rpms for dot net and also powershell.\n\nhas anyone been looking into this at all?\n",
