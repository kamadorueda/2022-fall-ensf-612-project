  "body": "The CorePS team refuses to do this. I am now partially a PowerShell on Windows developer.  The clean build monad script is currently totally broken, frustrating me and Jim. He had luck using Jason's new build system, and I'm currently waiting for it to finish building.  We can build and test PowerShell on Windows, but our patch does not build. Building it is totally blocked until the updated CoreCLR  on Windows  gets integrated. This should happen early next week.  Patch builds.
