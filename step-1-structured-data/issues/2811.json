  "body": "A small bug where content types from an Invoke-WebRequest that are not text-based fall through to a registry check.  Wrapping that check (which is additive) with a #if !CORECLR.  I can't find any tests that test out that specific behavior, or I would be happy to extend them.  I'm also happy to add a new test, just not sure if that is desired.",
