This is a breaking change!\r\n\r\nFrom Git documentation at https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Customizing-Git-Git-Hooks (emphasis by me)\r\n\r\n> To enable a hook script, put a file in the hooks subdirectory of your .git directory that is named appropriately (**without any extension**) and is executable. From that point forward, it should be called. We\u2019ll cover most of the major hook filenames here.\r\n\r\nGit hooks in written in PowerShell have worked flawlessly since the file name exetension requirement was removed in PowerShell 6.x. After the 7.2 release, trying execute a git command that has hooks associated with it results in an error message and commit fails.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nMake sure Git is installed with full support for all commands. Meaning that paths\r\n\r\n- `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\cmd`\r\n- `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\mingw64\\bin`\r\n- `C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin`\r\n\r\nare present in user or system `PATH` environment variable. Git for Windows installer will do this for you.\r\n\r\nThen create a file named `pre-commit` with content:\r\n```\r\n#!/usr/bin/env pwsh\r\nWrite-Verbose 'Hello from pre-commit hook' -Verbose\r\nexit 0\r\n```\r\nNote that shebang line is required here because of how Git was ported to Windows.\r\n\r\nMake sure the file name does not have any extension and place the file into `.git\\hooks` directory of a local git repository. \r\n\r\nMake some changes in the repo and try to commit them. For example: `git commit -m \"Testing\"` or use VS Code's version control tab.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\npre-commit hook gets executed:\r\n```console\r\nVERBOSE: Hello from pre-commit hook\r\n[testing ca1faea] Testing\r\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\r\n create mode 100644 test.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nCommit fails with error message:\r\n```console\r\nGit: Processing -File '.git/hooks/pre-commit' failed because the file does not have a '.ps1' extension. Specify a valid PowerShell script file name, and then try again.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

It has no relation what so ever with the actual file name. In case the file that should be executed happens to be script, like Bash, Python, PowerShell, Perl, etc., etc. , then a special notation starting with `#!` (called [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix))) in the beginning of the file tells the OS how proceed with the file. So anything can be executable. This concept does not exist in Windows.\r\n\r\nI have no actual knowledge about how Git was ported to Windows but just based on their web site and my experience, there is some kind of emulation layer that allows for Git developers to do things Unix-way, e.g without the need to care about extensions, and the emulation layer then does its best to implement those operations in the Windows world. This is clearly visible in the hooks as, even in Windows, they need to have that shebang notation but with `pwsh` as the executable[1].\r\n\r\nAdding support for extensions would require curated and parametrized list of allowed extensions, and well defined search order for those in case there is multiple extensions with the same file name. It's a can of worms from the Unix perspective.\r\n\r\n[1] Actually, the executable in the example is Git provided Windows port of [`env`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Env) which will then launch `pwsh` with the original script file name as a parameter .",

      "body": "If PowerShell script really needs to pass AppLocker and WDAC (understandable) and it works with extensions only, and Git is not going to change how hooks are called (which seems to be the case), then there is not too many options left. And the remaining ones are not pretty either.\r\n\r\nOne possible solution is to take advantage of the fact that in Windows an executable can be called without extension. So, my suggestion is to make `pwsh.exe` aware of its own file name and adjust its behaviour based on that name like this:\r\nWhen `pwsh.exe` is renamed to something else and called without extension, it searches for and evaluates a `.ps1` file with the same name as the executable and located in the same directory just  as if `pwsh.exe` would have been called with that file name as a parameter.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a diretory `C:\\repo\\.git\\hooks` contains files\r\n\r\n- `prepare-commit-msg.ps1`\r\n- `prepare-commit-msg.exe` (renamed `pwsh.exe`)\r\n\r\nthen a command `C:\\repo\\.git\\hooks\\prepare-commit-msg` (without extension) would make PowerShell to behave like the command would have been `\"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe\" C:\\repo\\.git\\hooks\\prepare-commit-msg.ps1`, while passing rest of the parameters to the script and taking care of STDIN, STDOUT and STDERR as usual.\r\n\r\nThere is some pros and cons to this.\r\n\r\nPros\r\n- It should work correctly, even with AppLocker and WDAC applying to both EXEs and scripts.\r\n- Executable is the same, no changes needed to publisher or hash based policies, unless publisher policy require exact file name.\r\n- Hooks are not versioned content of the repository. They are local to the computer hosting the repo. Thus, hooks are not pushed or cloned with the rest of the files.\r\n\r\nCons\r\n- It's a hack.\r\n- Needs one copy of `pwsh.exe` for each Git hook.\r\n- PowerShell executable would be outside its default path, which might cause problems with finding DLLs and require changes to path based policies.\r\n- Parameters cannot be passed to `pwsh.exe` without some new TBD method (envs, maybe?)",
