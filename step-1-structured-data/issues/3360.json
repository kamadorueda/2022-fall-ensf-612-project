Putting & at the end of a pipeline will cause the pipeline to be run as a PowerShell job. When a pipeline is backgrounded a job object is returned. Once the pipeline is running as a job, all of the normal job cmdlets can be used to manage the job. Variables (ignoring process-specific variables) used in the pipeline are automatically copied to the job so\r\n```powershell\r\ncopy $foo $bar &\r\n```\r\njust works. The job is also run in the current directory instead of the user's home directory as is the case with `Start-Job`. \r\n\r\nAddresses #716\r\n",

      "body": "Just a general comment about the design - do we have a good feel for how:\r\n\r\n1. people use `&` today?\r\n2. how we think they'll use it in the future?\r\n\r\nThere was the hypothesis that `&` is mostly used to launch windowed applications. If this is true, launching PowerShell to launch the application will feel slow because launching PowerShell is not fast. If we could avoid launching PowerShell first, that would be ideal, though that can only work if the pipeline is only running external commands.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the primary scenario really is background jobs, then this PR will be a great syntactic shortcut.",
