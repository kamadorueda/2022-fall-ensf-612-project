  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI can create a computer restore point in PowerSHell 7.2.1. \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nCheckpoint-Computer -description \"pre winget updates\"\r\nGet-ComputerRestorePoint\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut getting the restore point doesn't show the creation time. The value is there in the object as a DMTF string. But it doesn't get formatted. This works as expected in Windows PowerShell.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS C:\\> Get-ComputerRestorePoint\r\n\r\nCreationTime           Description                    SequenceNumber    EventType         RestorePointType\r\n------------           -----------                    --------------    ---------         ----------------\r\n1/20/2022 2:11:26 PM   Pre winget updates             63                BEGIN_SYSTEM_CHA\u2026 APPLICATION_INSTALL\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS C:\\> Get-ComputerRestorePoint\r\n\r\nCreationTime           Description                    SequenceNumber    EventType         RestorePointType\r\n------------           -----------                    --------------    ---------         ----------------\r\n                       Pre winget updates             63                BEGIN_SYSTEM_CHA\u2026 APPLICATION_INSTALL\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nThere are no errors.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\> $PSVersionTable \r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12089920/150407520-473be104-7406-4324-8f0f-6c207986a46e.png)\r\n\r\nThis works in Windows PowerShell on Windows 11 with no problem.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12089920/150407818-9605fbf8-0ca8-4588-a9e1-a9fb844016d9.png)\r\n",
