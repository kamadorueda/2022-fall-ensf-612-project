  "body": "# Exception Handling in PowerShell is the pits (part 1)\r\n### I am _re-filing_ this from Connect from as it appears to have gone missing again.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ntry\u00a0{\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0get-content\u00a0nosuchfile\u00a0-ErrorAction\u00a0Stop\r\n}\u00a0catch\u00a0[System.Management.Automation.ActionPreferenceStopException]\u00a0{\r\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0$_.PSTypeNames,\u00a0$_.Exception.PSTypeNames,\u00a0$_.Exception.InnerException.PSTypeNames\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n```\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord\r\nSystem.Object\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.ItemNotFoundException\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.SessionStateException\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.RuntimeException\r\nSystem.SystemException\r\nSystem.Exception\r\nSystem.Object\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nSince I \"caught\" an ActionPreferenceStopException, I should be able to see the ActionPreferenceStopException.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nPowerShell unwrapped the exception and gave me only what *caused* the exception. If I wanted that, I *would have* said so, since this works (and produces the same output as above)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ntry {\r\n   get-content nosuchfile -ErrorAction Stop\r\n} catch [System.Management.Automation.ItemNotFoundException] {\r\n   Write-Host \"It's an ItemNotFoundException, obviously\"\r\n   $_.PSTypeNames, $_.Exception.PSTypeNames, $_.Exception.InnerException.PSTypeNames\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\n## NOTE: THE REAL PROBLEM\r\n\r\nIt is *not* possible to catch the specific type explicitly, and **also** handle the generic case:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ntry {\r\n   get-content nosuchfile -ErrorAction Stop\r\n} catch [System.Management.Automation.ItemNotFoundException] {\r\n   Write-Host \"It's an ItemNotFoundException, which I can fix ... \"\r\n}  catch [System.Management.Automation.ActionPreferenceStopException] {\r\n   $_.PSTypeNames, $_.Exception.PSTypeNames, $_.Exception.InnerException.PSTypeNames\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThis has *always* been a problem, and it persists in PowerShell 6.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.15063\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@Jaykul Yes - this behaviour that's been around since the very beginning of PowerShell. Basically the pipeline uses `ActionPreferenceStopException` to wrap the exception that has the actual error in it then throws the wrapper. Consequently, if it wasn't automatically unwrapped in try/catch/trap you would never be able to catch the underlying exception since all you'd ever see would be the wrapper. So your example:\r\n```\r\ntry {\r\n   get-content nosuchfile -ErrorAction Stop\r\n} catch [System.Management.Automation.ItemNotFoundException] {\r\n   Write-Host \"It's an ItemNotFoundException, obviously\"\r\n   $_.PSTypeNames, $_.Exception.PSTypeNames, $_.Exception.InnerException.PSTypeNames\r\n} \r\n```\r\nwouldn't work. \r\n\r\nWhy do you want to catch this exception?

      "body": "> Whether or not this \"should\" be catchable, the behaviour should remain consistent.\r\n\r\nThat's my thinking on this one: that it shouldn't be catchable, and that maybe PSScriptAnalyzer should flag if/when someone tries to catch a `System.Management.Automation.ActionPreferenceStopException`, because the intent of `-ErrorAction Stop` is to promote a non-terminating exception to terminating, not to generate an exception of a specific type that you would want to catch in a type-specific handler. Unless the fact that `ActionPreferenceStopException` is used as a wrapper to carry the non-terminating exception to the appropriate catch handler is relevant (I personally don't see the value in that though).",

Then we can either discuss further or close this issue out and log an issue for the PSSA rule to be created.",
