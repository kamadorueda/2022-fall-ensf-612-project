  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ntail -f /var/log/system.log\r\n# Hit CTRL-Z\r\n# Hit CTRL-C\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nI would expect it to background the job, as specified in #3229. Since `bg`-like functionality is not supported, I would expect it to do nothing, then allow me to terminate/interrupt the running job with CTRL-C.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nIt seems that after CTRL-Z is hit, the terminal becomes completely unresponsive. This is only on iTerm, it works fine with Kitty and Terminal. I'm hoping someone can help me investigate.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0\r\nOS                             Darwin 17.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.7.0: Thu Jun 21 22:53:14 PDT 2018; root:xnu-4570.71.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
