Execute `\"\u00f8\u00e6\u00e5\" | <any non-powershell command>` \r\n\r\n2. See that the string has been converted to `???`\r\n\r\n3. Execute `\"\u00f8\u00e6\u00e5\" | <any cmdlet>`\r\n\r\n4. See that the string is maintained correctly as `\u00f8\u00e6\u00e5`\r\n\r\nThis behavior has occurred with every native program and every cmdlet I've tested it with.\r\n\r\nI've also experienced the same behavior when reading a file with `gc` and then piping that along.\r\n\r\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19817004/25645722/f921535a-2f65-11e7-909d-559981874d70.PNG)\r\n\r\nAs seen in the last example in the picture, the string is actually being converted to `???` rather than this being a display error.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nString should remain `\u00f8\u00e6\u00e5` when being piped anywhere.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nString is corrupted when being piped to a non-powershell-builtin\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nCLRVersion\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.18\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is on Windows 7.\r\n",
