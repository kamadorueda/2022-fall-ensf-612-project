  "body": "When trying to build on linux (ubuntu 14.04), `cmake` failed with:\n\n```\nCMake Error at test/CMakeLists.txt:1 (add_subdirectory):\n  The source directory\n\n    /home/mwrock/dev/powershell/src/libpsl-native/test/googletest\n\n  does not contain a CMakeLists.txt file.\n\n-- Configuring incomplete, errors occurred!\n```\n\nThis will occur if the googletest submodule is not updated.\n\nAlthough the git readme advises to clone with `--recursive` there are a couple issues here:\n- At least for me, `--recursive` fails when it attempts to update the pester submodule asking me for credentials and  I don't believe I have access. So it never gets googletest.\n- Many developers are not accustomed to a submodule workflow. Other than the submodules, a developer familiar with git will find building powershell to be trivial from a git stand point and will likely not bother to read the git readme when trying to get started.\n  So I think updating just the googletest submodule during bootstrap will provide a path more likely to succeed.\n",
