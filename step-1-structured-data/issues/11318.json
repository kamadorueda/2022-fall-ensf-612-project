  "body": "AWS PowerShell Lambda uses the `ResetRunspaceState()` API as part of a performance optimization  when running PowerShell scripts on Lambda. The use of this API causes `$?` to become useless in a runspace after `ResetRunspaceState()` is called. \r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\n$iss = [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.InitialSessionState]::CreateDefault()\r\n$rs = [RunspaceFactory]::CreateRunspace($iss);\r\n$rs.Open();\r\n\r\n# Now reset the runspace state\r\n#$rs.ResetRunspaceState();\r\n\r\n$ps = [powershell]::Create($rs).AddScript(@'\r\n        Get-Date\r\n        [console]::WriteLine(\"After Get-Date; hook is $?\")\r\n\r\n        Get-Content NoSuchFile\r\n        [console]::WriteLine(\"After Get-Content; hook is $?\")\r\n\r\n        # Customer's xample\r\n        try { NoSuchCommand } catch {}\r\n        [console]::WriteLine(\"After try/catch; hook is $?\")\r\n'@)\r\n\r\n$ps.Invoke()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe `$?` variable should accurately reflect that execution status of the last command like this:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nAfter Get-Date; hook is True\r\nAfter Get-Content; hook is False\r\nAfter try/catch; hook is False\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhat actually happens is that, regardless of the execution status of the last command, `$?` is always true.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nAfter Get-Date; hook is True\r\nAfter Get-Content; hook is True\r\nAfter try/catch; hook is True\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt looks like all that's required to fix this is to remove the line of code in `ResetRunspaceState()` that's overwriting the `$?` variable, especially given that there's no real reason to be doing this in the first place. Note: this issue doesn't affect the chaining operators that @rjmholt added so that code must be using the underlying data element. \r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\nNote: This bug appears to repro on all versions of PowerShell.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.6-18-g2a76aa10ee804f47ad2499915d206e1dd470898d\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
