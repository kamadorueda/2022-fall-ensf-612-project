  "body": "PowerShell's self-documentation capability is great, but there's no room to add license information at the top of the file.  If you try that, the entire help system breaks, and ```Get-Help``` ignores everything. \r\n\r\nFor example, I tried to include it before my regular help and my code:\r\n```\r\n<#\r\nTest-FeatureRequest.ps1\r\nby John Doe <jdoe@example.tld>\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of\r\nthe GNU General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation, either version\r\n3 of the License.

See the GNU General Public License for more details.\r\n\r\nYou should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along with this program.\r\nIf not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>.\r\n\r\n.SYNOPSIS\r\nfoo\r\n\r\n.DESCRIPTION\r\nfoo\r\n\r\n.PARAMETER result\r\nfoo\r\n#>\r\ncode goes here\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat caused the entire comment block to be ignored:\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\jdoe> Get-Help .\\Test-FeatureRequest.ps1\r\nTest-FeatureRequest.ps1 [-result] <Object> [<CommonParameters>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tried a few variants unsuccessfully, like splitting the comment block into two.  There was no difference between me putting the license information first or second.\r\n```\r\n<#\r\n[license text goes here -- I won't retype it every time]\r\n#>\r\n<#\r\n.SYNOPSIS\r\nfoo\r\n\r\n.DESCRIPTION\r\nfoo\r\n\r\n.PARAMETER result\r\nfoo\r\n#>\r\n```\r\nI tried inventing a .LICENSE keyword and using that, in hopes PowerShell would think it's from a future version of the language and quietly ignore it.  That, too, made PowerShell ignore the entire block.\r\n```\r\n<#\r\n.LICENSE\r\n[license text goes here]\r\n\r\n.SYNOPSIS\r\nfoo\r\n\r\n.DESCRIPTION\r\nfoo\r\n\r\n.PARAMETER result\r\nfoo\r\n#>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the end, I had to stick my license information into the .NOTES section.  This works, but it has the side effect of showing the information, which is meant to be a file header, every time someone uses the Get-Help command on my script -- not the end of the world.\r\n\r\nI feel the next iteration of PowerShell Core should have a new documentation item, ```.LICENSE```.  Its primary purpose would be to \"decorate\" the top of a file.  However, if implemented, it should also be shown when ```Get-Help -Full``` is called, as many licenses also specify how the program can be shared with others;  this is similar to finding most apps' license information under Help > About.\r\n\r\nI tried this on PowerShell and Windows PowerShell, with identical results:\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.17134.112\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.17134.112\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```",
