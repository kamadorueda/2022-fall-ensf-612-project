  "body": "Problem statement:\r\n\r\nPowershell hangs when powershell scripts are run in parallel from multiple powershell consoles simultaneously .\r\n\r\nTechnical Details:\r\n\r\nThis problem is a kind of deadlock. A thread which is calling DrainPendingActions is actually the thread that invokes actions in ActionQueue. Therefore, DrainPendingActions will never finish if there are one or more actions in ActionQueue.\r\n\r\nCreate-Session and Remove-PSSession respectively are used to create and remove a connection to Exchange server.\r\n\r\nWhen Remove-PSSession is executed, the connection to Exchange server is closed, and subscribed events are triggered and added to ActionQueue. Because it is a queue, the events will be triggered in the same order of arrival.\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that events are arriving in a different order of event occurrence. Specifically, the subscribed event for the status change to Closed is arriving before the subscribed event for the status change to Closing.\r\n\r\nWhen the subscribed event for Closed is triggered, the thread executes Unregister-Event command, then call DrainPendingActions and will never come back possibly because its getting stuck in the while loop.\r\n",
