We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license.\r\n\r\n>When you clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a \"clean\" build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license (note, i made this commit to help make this more clear).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nAs above, export telemetry and endpoints as a build configuration (that does not mean you should remove the env variables setup for people who use official builds)",
