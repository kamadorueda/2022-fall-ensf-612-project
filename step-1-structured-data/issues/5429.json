  "body": "To make it easier to selfhost daily:\r\n\r\n1. removed [validate] attribute from parameter so this script can be invoked directly from web.\r\n  This doesn't have any negative impact as the $Destination parameter will have default value if null or empty.\r\n2. moved removal of destination folder later as installing the package requires packagemanagement module and archive module (on Windows)\r\n3. on Windows, because files have open handles when run from existing powershell-daily install, I rename the existing files and copy over the new ones.  User needs to exit and restart pwsh to take effect (similar to macOS/Linux where you have to exit and restart anyways)\r\n",
