However, when starting `pwsh` with `-settings <config.json>`, `Console` shows a bunch of security exceptions (see an example screenshot below).\r\n\r\nBe noted that, @TravisEz13 tried the scirpt block logging on his macOS (version `10.13.6`), and `Console` consistently shows a bunch of security exception errors no matter by putting `powershell.config.json` under `$PSHOME` or by using `-settngs <config.json>`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1121\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-08-01 at 3 56 05 pm\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/43553372-8084e0c4-95a3-11e8-858a-1c1964464f56.png\">\r\n",
