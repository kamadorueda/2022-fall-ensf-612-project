  "body": "About half the time there is not output result in the $logFile even though on the console there was plently of output.  The other half of the time there is output in the $logFile.  It seems very random on if the output works or not.  Actually I would say a little less than half the time the helm ouput does NOT appear in the $logFile.\r\n\r\nI'm using PowerShell core 6.1 on Windows 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nStart-Transcript -Force -IncludeInvocationHeader -Path $logFile\r\ntry {\r\n    helm upgrade --install --wait --force --debug -f ./helm/zookeeper/values.yaml platform-zookeeper ./helm/zookeeper\r\n} finally {\r\n    Stop-Transcript\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also happen with `kubectl` commands as well.",
