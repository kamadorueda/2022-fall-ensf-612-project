See the PSCX impl for[ Get-Hash ](https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx/blob/master/Src/Pscx/Commands/IO/GetHashCommand.cs)as an example.  Of course, if I were writing this command from scratch today, I would default to SHA256 instead of MD5.  :-)\n",

My only point is that it would be nice to have a cmdlet that hashes strings (in addition to the existing cmdlet that operates on files).\n\nIt is a drag that if you want to hash a string, you have to write it to a file.  OK that is not entirely true, you _can_ hash a string directly but not many folks will figure this out:\n\n``` powershell\nGet-FileHash -InputStream ([System.IO.MemoryStream]::new([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetBytes(\"open sesame\")))\n```\n",
