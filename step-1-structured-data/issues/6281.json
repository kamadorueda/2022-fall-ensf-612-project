  "body": "`psrp` nuget package has `libpsrpclient.so` which depends on `libmi.so`. \r\n\r\nWhen an netcore app adds reference to `psrp` nuget package in its csproj and executes `dotnet publish`, both the nuget packages are downloaded to nuget cache. \r\n\r\n`libpsrp.so` expects the `libmi.so` to be present in the same folder, but `libmi.so` is located in the nuget cache under it's package folder.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nLocation of `psrp` in nuget cache.\r\n`/home/user/.nuget/packages/psrp/1.4.1/runtimes/linux-x64/native/libpsrpclient.so`\r\n\r\nLocation of `libmi` in nuget cache.\r\n`/home/user/.nuget/packages/libmi/1.4.101000/runtimes/linux-x64/native/libmi.so`\r\n\r\n`psrp` expects `libmi.so` to be at `/home/user/.nuget/packages/psrp/1.4.1/runtimes/linux-x64/native/`\r\n\r\nThanks @ianByrne for finding the issue.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nSample located at:  https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3417#issuecomment-369206764\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nApplication runs as expected.\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nError:\r\n>This parameter set requires WSMan, and no supported WSMan client library was found.
