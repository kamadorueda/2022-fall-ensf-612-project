Are you able to find a folder named after the version in `$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Microsoft\\PowerShell`, if so, can you share what files are in that folder (e.g. folder named `7.0.1`)?\r\n\r\nIn your screenshot, nothing is displayed in the pwsh console, which make me suspect Windows Defender being the culprit.",
