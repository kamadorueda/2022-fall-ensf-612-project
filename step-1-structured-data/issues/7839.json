However, the wait produces its own problems - see #4594.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "The current behavior is a limitation of the original design optimized (or constrained if you prefer) to display objects of the same type.  Note that derived types will work, just disparate types won't be displayed.  As noted by @mklement0 I'm open to a RFC to propose a solution on how to handle this.  Consider if you have an array of a,a,b,a,b,a where [a] and [b] are different types.  How would these be displayed?  Should they be grouped by type and then displayed or interleave different tables which makes it hard to read.  Of course grouping means that it would have to capture all the output before it can start rendering or cache all objects not the same as the first type which can use lots of memory.",

You'd end up with some extra whitespace, I'm sure, but it accurately represents the overall structure of the underlying data properly, nothing is hidden, and the user can clearly see the state of things (and easily correct if need be)",
