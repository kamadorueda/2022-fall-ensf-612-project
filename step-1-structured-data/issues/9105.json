That is why it is\nbaffling.\nOf course you can say that the Linux implementation is wrong, as far as the\ndefinition of alias goes.\nI am sure some body in the microsoft design team had a good reason not to\nsupport the alias arguments.\nJust thinking out loud.\n\nThanks\nsguha\n\nOn Mon, Mar 11, 2019 at 10:44 AM vexx32 <notifications@github.com> wrote:\n\n> Aliases are designed to essentially just register a new name for the same\n> command, and don't really provide for supplying arguments as well.
