  "body": "Our private implementation of FailFast was likely introduced\r\nwhen each individual application needed it's own code to\r\nget Watson reports. The CLR takes care of this for us now,\r\nso we don't need our implementation.\r\n\r\nOur method CheckForSevereException was also introduced in\r\nthe early days of the CLR - the exceptions it was checking\r\nfor aren't actually raised the CLR anymore, they just FailFast.\r\nI removed them as there is a tiny bit of overhead (in code size)\r\nand also in the generated code, e.g. dynamic sites called the method.",
