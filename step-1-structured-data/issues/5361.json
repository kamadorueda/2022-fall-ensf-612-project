  "body": "This enables a number of useful scenarios.\r\nWith this change it is now possible to do the following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nget-content -raw -encoding iso8859 /tmp/archive.tgz | gunzip | tar xvf -\r\n```\r\nand expand a compressed tar archive.\r\nIt also ensures that the bytes/characters passed to a native executable are not changed by the pipeline.\r\nWhat is passed into the pipeline is passed to the next native application\r\n\r\nThis does _not_ address https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1908, as that requires a larger re-architecture of the pipeline. This PR continues to have a `[environment]::newline` which is added to the native output which should be addressed when 1908 is fixed.\r\n\r\nThis is marked as a breaking change because the output of the pipeline is not altered as it was previously, anyone relying on ascii encoding (especially for extended ascii sequences) will no longer have that behavior (broken though it was).",
