This advisory also provides guidance on what developers can do to update their applications to remove this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is aware of a denial of service vulnerability exists when ASP.NET Core improperly handles web requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of service against an ASP.NET Core web application. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without authentication.\r\n\r\nA remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the .NET Core application.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update PowerShell Core to an unaffected version version (see [affected software](#user-content-affected-software).)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nPlease use aspnet/AspNetCore#6487 for discussion of the .NET aspects this advisory.\r\n\r\n## <a name=\"affected-software\">Affected Software</a>\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects PowerShell Core prior to the following versions:\r\n\r\n| PowerShell Core Version | Fixed in          |\r\n|-------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| 6.1                     | 6.1.2             |\r\n| 6.2                     | TBD               |\r\n\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\nIf all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in [Affected Software](#user-content-affected-software) to see if your version of PowerShell Core is affected.\r\n1. If you are running a version of PowerShell Core where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.\r\n1. You use `System.Net.WebSockets.dll`.\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Installing PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\r\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\r\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\r\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\r\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\r\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\r\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\r\n\r\nSee [acknowledgments](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/acknowledgments) for more information.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2019-0564](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2019-0564)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Jan 15, 2019): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n*Version 1.0*\r\n*Last Updated 2019-01-15*\r\n",
