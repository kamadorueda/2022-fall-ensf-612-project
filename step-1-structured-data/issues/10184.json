Changing execution location ie ```c:\\``` does not resolve the issue.\r\n``` \r\nC:\\Users\\ed obeda>pwsh -c Get-Date\r\n\r\nCould not execute because the specified command or file was not found.\r\nPossible reasons for this include:\r\n  * You misspelled a built-in dotnet command.\r\n  * You intended to execute a .NET Core program, but dotnet-C:\\Users\\ed does not exist.\r\n  * You intended to run a global tool, but a dotnet-prefixed executable with this name could not be found on the PATH.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nWindows 10 Enterprise. Provide the output of $PSVersionTable  fails with the same error.\r\n\r\n",
