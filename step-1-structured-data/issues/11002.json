  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6?view=powershell-6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. Install Powershell 7 Release 5 x64 on a up-to-date Windows 10 Computer\r\n2. Run Powershell 7\r\n3. Run the following script...\r\n\r\n$ComputerNames = \"Computer1\",\"Computer2\", \"Computer3\"\r\n$ComputerNames | ForEach-Object -Parallel {\r\n     Restart-Computer -ComputerName $_ -Force -Wait -Timeout 1800\r\n}\r\n4. Wait the allotted Timeout period of 30 minutes.\r\n\r\nWhere Computer1-3 are test computers on the same network.\r\n\r\nPaul Higin Tested this and commented in another tread;\r\n\r\n\"This appears to be an error in the Restart-Computer cmdlet. When I run it alone in the latest\r\npreview build, it restarts the remote computer as expected, but never returns and eventually \r\ncrashes PowerShell. I get the same behavior when running it within a foreach -parallel \r\nscript block.\r\n\r\nThis appears to have nothing to do with foreach -parallel, except that foreach -parallel doesn't\r\ncurrently support progress data (by design) and so there is no indicator of how the computer\r\nrestart is proceeding.\r\n\r\nI feel this Issue should be closed and two new issues open:\r\na. Restart-Computer -cn -Force -Wait -Timeout is broken in latest build.\r\nb. ForEach -Parallel to support progress data stream (not sure how this would work and it would \r\nbe a new feature request anyway).\"\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe remote computer will reboot and the script will continue without error.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe computers reboot, but PowerShell never reconnects to them.\r\n\r\nAfter 30 Minutes, the following errors are received;\r\n\r\nRestart-Computer: Failed to restart the computer Computer1 with the following error\r\n message: The computer did not finish restarting within the specified time-out period..\r\nRestart-Computer: Failed to restart the computer Computer2 with the following error\r\n message: The computer did not finish restarting within the specified time-out period..\r\nRestart-Computer: Failed to restart the computer Computer3 with the following error\r\n message: The computer did not finish restarting within the specified time-out period..\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
