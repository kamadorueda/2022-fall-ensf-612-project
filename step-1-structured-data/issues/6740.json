It should be possible to check if methods like WriteVerbose will do anything before formatting, or at least add overloads that do the formatting only after deciding the formatted string is needed.\r\n\r\nWe could add a few overloads to `WriteVerbose` and `WriteWarning`, which take a format string and arguments. So we can defer the construction of message until we know for sure we are going to write out verbose messages.\r\n\r\nOpen this issue to track this investigation.",

I would suggest `$PSCmdlet.ShouldWriteInformation` and friends to check if there is someone receiving the output. People can choose to use that only if formatting is \"expensive\".\r\n\r\nIt is also noticeable that, if the message output procedure has any side effects, they will for sure manifest themselves under current implementation, and for once (whether or not it is `SilentlyContinue`, whether or not it is directed to a variable). Documentation on the new paradigm should warn programmers of side effects.",
