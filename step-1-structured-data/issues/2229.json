  "body": "Using GetType() on an array reports that it is an Object[] with a Base Type of System.Array.\nHowever, using Get-Member on an array gives the members for the objects stored in the array and not of an array object.\n\nWhat can I use to see the properties and methods available on an array which would include Count and Length properties?\n\nThis does not appear to be the same for a hash collection. Using Get-Member on a hash on a System.Collections.Hashtable returns the properties and methods of a hash, not the contents of the hash.\n\n```\n$a = @(1,2)\n$a\nWrite-Host '=== Array is created'\n$a.GetType()\n$a | Get-Member | Format-Table\nWrite-Host '=== Second element of array'\n$a[1]\n$a[1].GetType()\n$a[1] | Get-Member | Format-Table\n```\n",
