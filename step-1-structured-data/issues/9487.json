I narrowed it down to something useful though, your post made me think to do more debugging, so I tried renaming my powershell profile so it would not load. And, the problem disappeared, through a process of elimination, I found the culprit lines:\r\n```\r\nSet-PSReadLineOption -Colors @{Parameter = \"yellow\"}\r\nSet-PSReadLineOption -Colors @{type = \"yellow\"}\r\nSet-PSReadLineOption -Colors @{string = \"yellow\"}\r\nSet-PSReadLineOption -Colors @{operator = \"yellow\"}\r\nSet-PSReadLineOption -Colors @{comment = \"yellow\"}\r\n```\r\nI use these, and only these to change console colors, and if any one of them is present in the powershell profile .ps1 file, the issue happens (again, only when run from explorer, not cmd line). Sorry I didn't think of it before, maybe there is a new way to change colors now? Though these seem to change the colors as expected..",
