  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOpen PowerShell using the Start Menu link on Windows.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe default prompt should be located at `$env:USERPROFILE` or `$env:USERPROFILE\\Documents` on Windows.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe default prompt opens at `C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.2`.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy this should be changed\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe default for PowerShell 5.x is $env:USERPROFILE, as outlined in this screenshot:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/504826/43293812-72b8f75a-917f-11e8-8016-c1cc50b6cb2f.png)\r\n\r\nThis is both versions of PowerShell, with PowerShell Core just being the default installation from the provided MSI.\r\n\r\nEvery time I want to use PowerShell Core, I have to `cd` to my user profile directory before I can get any work done, since the default working directory isn't writable (and even if it was, I wouldn't really want to be writing things into there). In addition, since it's \"so far away\" from the directories I normally operate in, I have to `cd` with an absolute path which means typing a long directory path correctly every time.\r\n\r\nIf this was something I had to do once then it wouldn't be so bad, but it's *every time* I open a PSCore prompt on Windows, so it gets tiring after a while.\r\n",
