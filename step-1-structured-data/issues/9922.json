  "body": "# Summary of the thing\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few places in the codebase that utilise the pattern `value == null || value == AutomationNull.Value`. I've mentioned this briefly before: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9561#issuecomment-497814351\r\n\r\n# Solution\r\n\r\nWe need to review the places in the code this pattern occurs and assess:\r\n\r\n1. Does it make sense to check for this? For cmdlets (there are a couple) it may not need to be checked. The parameter binder automatically coerces AutomationNull to true null before passing it in.\r\n    - Small caveat being that on occasion there may potentially be AutomationNulls inside some collection types that will not be picked up by the binder and converted, so there may still be some places this check is warranted.\r\n\r\n2. Should this _really_ be a manual check every time? We have `LanguagePrimitives.IsNull()` which already performs this check. We should replace most if not all of the existing patterns like this with the single method, rather than doing a manual check. In the unlikely event that this pattern needs to be updated, it'll be significantly less work if the method is actually being utilised properly.\r\n\r\n## Code Links\r\n\r\nBelow is a list of locations in the code where this check is made, so that we can properly assess each occurrence and make sure we don't make a careless fix. Additionally, in certain locations it _may_ make sense to utilise the `IsNullLike()` (name pending review) method instead (from #9794), if we also want to accept DBNull or NullString as \"null\" in that place in the code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d67ee7aee3cf4e25fcd750e5f576054b0361a031/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/ConvertTo-Html.cs#L692\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/aba3bd5df1ea9d97790e7b232e50995e9f3d1e37/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/FormatAndOutput/OutGridView/OutGridViewCommand.cs#L177\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/42c289fc8eeaeb684cd8f2b5f55d4b1ee869dbfc/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/GetMember.cs#L142\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/aba3bd5df1ea9d97790e7b232e50995e9f3d1e37/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Measure-Object.cs#L481\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/aba3bd5df1ea9d97790e7b232e50995e9f3d1e37/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/OrderObjectBase.cs#L385\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d67ee7aee3cf4e25fcd750e5f576054b0361a031/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Select-Object.cs#L822\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/7e423e7451a4530060422aff1c821c0dc0712372/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Attributes.cs#L1436\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bd6fdae73520931f0d27a29d6290e18761772141/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CmdletParameterBinderController.cs#L3363\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bd6fdae73520931f0d27a29d6290e18761772141/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/common/BaseFormattingCommand.cs#L99\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bd6fdae73520931f0d27a29d6290e18761772141/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/common/BaseOutputtingCommand.cs#L49\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bd6fdae73520931f0d27a29d6290e18761772141/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/common/BaseOutputtingCommand.cs#L49",
