If so, if you pipe an array, should you get back an array or the single concatenated object that now exists in the clipboard?  Alternatively, does `-Passthru` return the result of what you're setting which means if `-Append` is used, then it should be the entire contents of the clipboard?  I think what would help to answer these questions is how users intend to use this switch and some examples of real world usage.",

I think what would help to answer these questions is how users intend to use this switch and some examples of real world usage.\r\n\r\nWhen I pipe an array into Set-Clipboard, my clipboard (according to Get-Clipboard) contains an array, not a string. (I am only on 5.1 however, I'm not sure if this has changed.)\r\n\r\nI think using -Passthru with -Append should return the entire clipboard, that feels intuitive to me, and consistent with other cmdlets eg the Active Directory suite, where using Set-ADUser with -Passthru returns the ADUser object, rather than the particular properties I've set.",

      "body": "I'll put this here from the PR:\r\n\r\n`Set-Clipboard -PassThru` without the `-Append` switch parameter and `Get-Clipboard` will always return the same data. This is the correct example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$result = 'hello', 'world' | Set-Clipboard -PassThru \r\n$result\r\n\r\nhello\r\nworld\r\n\r\nGet-Clipboard\r\n\r\nhello\r\nworld\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe scenario I'm talking about is when the clipboard already has data and the `-Append` switch is used to add data. In that scenario should be behavior be to output the entire clipboard or just the the passed data?\r\n\r\n### Return entire clipboard\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$result = 'hello' | Set-Clipboard -PassThru\r\n$result\r\n\r\nhello\r\n\r\n$result = 'world' | Set-Clipboard -Append -PassThru\r\n$result\r\n\r\nhello\r\nworld\r\n\r\nGet-Clipboard\r\n\r\nhello\r\nworld\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Return only passed data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$result = 'hello' | Set-Clipboard -PassThru\r\n$result\r\n\r\nhello\r\n\r\n$result = 'world' | Set-Clipboard -Append -PassThru\r\n$result\r\n\r\nworld\r\n\r\nGet-Clipboard\r\n\r\nhello\r\nworld\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason I ask is because, in all the other cmdlets with a `-PassThru` parameter, only the passed data is sent down the pipeline, not everything. In this example, lets replace `Set-Clipboard -PassThru -Append` with `Add-Content -PassThru`. The user is adding `world` to the file and specified `-PassThru`. I don't think any user would expect that the entire contents of the file would be output during this command. And as we expect when we run the commands we don't get `hello` and `world` but, just `world`. That is because the user may want to use `world` in other cmdlets. Hopefully, this example shows the similarities between the clipboard and files when it comes to `-PassThru -Append` logic.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nC:\\> Set-Content -Path c:\\temp\\content.txt -Value 'hello'\r\nC:\\> 'world' | Add-Content -Path C:\\temp\\content.txt -PassThru\r\nworld\r\n```",
