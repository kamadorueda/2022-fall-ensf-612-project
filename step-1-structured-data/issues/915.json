      "body": "Instead of using `dotnet publish`, we can use `dotnet build` and the new\n`netcoreapp1.0` framework with a new dependency on\n`Microsoft.NETCore.App` to generate output that does not include the\nruntime, but can be run anywhere (given the installation of the\nruntime).\n\nWhile we cannot yet adopt a dependency on the shared host until .NET\nCore RTM, we are forced to switch to this system anyway because the\nlatest RC3 packages and CLI do not support `netstandardapp1.5`. See\ndotnet/cli#2482.\n\nThus we're in an in-between state where we have to use `netcoreapp1.0`,\nbut cannot use `\"Microsoft.NETCore.App\": { \"type\": \"platform\" }` to\nutilize the shared host, as we need to continue to ship our host.\nWithout specifying \"platform\", we retain the status quo with respect to\nbuild steps and outputs.\n\nAdditionally, there is no longer a good reason to use the RC3 packages,\nand it has been advised we switch to RC2 since the\n`Microsoft.NETCore.App` is only available for RC2. We must update\npackages because our current version can no longer be debugged.\n",
