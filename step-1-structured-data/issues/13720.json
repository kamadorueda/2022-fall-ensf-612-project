It doesn't occur anymore after calling `Remove-Module PSReadLine`.\r\nBut the syntax highlighting is gone too\r\n\r\nAnd yes, if I call `Import-Module PSReadLine` again, the issue occurred again. So looks like it's a PSReadLine issue.\r\nShould I instead report the issue in PSReadLine's repository?",
