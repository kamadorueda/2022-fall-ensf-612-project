  "body": "I've noticed that powershell version in GitHub, Nuget and Winget distribution are all up-to-date to 7.1.2.\r\nI just can't believe that powershell version in microsoft store distribution is still 7.1.1, while preview sticks to v7.2.0-preview.2.And winget's  preview sticks to v7.2.0-preview.2 as well.\r\nI thought that ms store and winget are designed to be official package manager in Windows 10, but \u2753. I think microsoft official should better ensure version up-to-date on microsoft own distribution channel\r\nIt is really unhappy to see \r\n```\r\n   A new PowerShell stable release is available: v7.1.2\r\n   Upgrade now, or check out the release page at:\r\n     https://aka.ms/PowerShell-Release?tag=v7.1.2\r\n```\r\nwhile you have no way to deal with it in microsoft-store-delivered powershell",
