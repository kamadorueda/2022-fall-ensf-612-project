Please refer to [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/q/68176305/1219280) I posted earlier today in StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nIn a short, I found a supposedly working snippet at [Windows Powershell In Action 2nd Edition, by Bruce Payette, at Chapter 13 - Remoting](https://livebook.manning.com/book/windows-powershell-in-action-second-edition/chapter-13/225).\r\n\r\nI slightly adapted the script to look as follows:\r\n```\r\n$password = \"myPass\"\r\n$domainAndUser = \"myDomain&User\"\r\n$computerName = \"myRemoteComputerIp\"\r\n$pwSession = convertto-securestring -AsPlainText -Force $password\r\n$cred = new-object -typename System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -argumentlist $domainAndUser,$pwSession\r\n$pso = New-PSSessionOption -OperationTimeout (5*1000)\r\n$session = new-pssession -computername $computerName -credential $cred -SessionOption $pso\r\nInvoke-Command $session { 1..10 | foreach {\"$_\" + ('*' * $_) ; Start-Sleep 1} }\r\n```\r\nI expected to see the same `The WinRM client cannot complete\r\nthe operation within the time specified` error as described in the snippet from the book. But I am not able to achieve such result. Tried several variations.\r\n\r\nReproduces in both Powershell 5.1 and 7.1.3, on Windows. \r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nError `The WinRM client cannot complete\r\nthe operation within the time specified` should be displayed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nInvoke-Command script block proceeds till completion, without being aborted due timeout.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Should I not naturally assume creating a `PsSessionOption` setting `OperationTimeout` should affect the `New-PsSession` created by passing this very `PsSessionOption` as a parameter ?\r\n\r\nThis `WSMan`/`PsSession` layer background is not something a simple powershell user knows of, especially if it is not mentioned in the docs, say, `PsSessionOption` parameters.",

It's the timeout for how long the WSMan server can take before it responds back with some data. Where this is actually used is in the `Receive` requests that PowerShell is sending to the server. The request will wait until either there is data to send back to the client or the operation timeout is hit. The standard operation is to just resend the `Receive` request when a timeout is received as that is bound to happen with any long running script. The only time `-OperationTimeout` would actually cause a failure here is if the time it took to create the actual shell/command took longer than that value. The actual running of the command is not affected.\r\n\r\nWhat this really needs is a doc update to clarify what `-OperationTimeout` affects, mostly nothing.",

      "body": "> how do we understand the script excerpt mentioned above taken from Bruce Payette's Powershell book (code excerpt (screenshot) here)?\r\n\r\nHonestly I don't know why it says what it says. I've tested all the way back to PowerShell v2 and the behaviour that occurs today is the same as it is in 7.1. Maybe it was tested with some internal build I'm honestly not sure. If you do find out then I'm definitely interested to hear what it was.\r\n\r\n> How do I know if I am using WSMan or PsSession ? I mean the script itself is based on a PsSession. Yet, the book example does seem to infer OperationTimeout does affect the duration of the Invoke-Command.\r\n\r\nEssentially everything before powershell v5 used WSMan. All the options in `New-PSSessionOption` relate to WSMan settings and AFAIK don't affect any of the other transports added. You know it's WSMan because the session was created with `-ComputerName`. SSH uses `-HostName`, Hyper-V direct uses `-VMName`, etc.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure what the usual process is here but I assume the issue should be raised on https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs as that is where this information lives.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/44411511/850abe80-7ca6-11e9-886f-a1b13b275ae0\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs\">MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs</a></strong></div><div>The official PowerShell documentation sources.
