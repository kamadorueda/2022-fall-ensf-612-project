Introduce `PredictionClient` to represent a client. It provides additional information about the type of the client: terminal, editor.\r\n2. Update `ICommandPredictor` interface to replace the properties `SupportEarlyProcessing` and `AcceptFeedback` with the method `CanAcceptFeedback(PredictionClient client, PredictorFeedbackKind feedback)`. So a predictor implementation can be specific about whether it accepts each feedback.\r\n3. Add the feedback event `OnCommandLineExecuted`. It provides a predictor the information about the execution result (success or failure) of the last accepted user input.\r\n4. Update how delegate is created in `CommandPrediction`, to minimize the allocation of the delegate helper object.\r\n5. Add more tests and fix the fragile test.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n1. The `Az.Predictor` team asked for the new feedback `OnCommandExecuted`, which provides the execution status (success or failure) of the last accepted user input.\r\n2. A predictor implementation will need the information about the client type (terminal, editor) to properly serve those 2 different scenarios, so we need to use a type to represent the client.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [x] Experimental feature name(s): **PSSubsystemPluginModel**\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.",
