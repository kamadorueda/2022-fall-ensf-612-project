Can you please clarify (in the documentation) which release we're waiting for, and how these \"additional package\"s will be delivered.\r\n",

We need to do a lot more thinking on this as JEA today is tightly coupled with WinRM.  This will go the RFC route.\n\nThe client side WSMan remoting on Linux/Mac is being done in this repo: https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-omi-provider. \n\n#2586\n",
