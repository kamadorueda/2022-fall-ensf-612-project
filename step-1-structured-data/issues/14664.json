  "body": "## An option in \"Windows Powershell\" properties to revert to the default color settings\r\n\r\nWindows Powershell is an amazing tool. It's highly customizable, especially in terms of its visuals. However, once the users have opted to customize Powershell, it becomes really difficult to revert to the default color settings. Unless the users remember those default settings, **there isn't an easy way to go back**.\r\n\r\nThis led me (and, probably, other users as well) to some **shady solutions on the web** that require downloading and replacing some original files with those on their websites.\r\n\r\nWould really love to see an option that says \"Reset to default\"/\"Reset Settings\" on Windows Powershell properties.\r\n",
