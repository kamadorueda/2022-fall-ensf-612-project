      "body": "I think this is a PowerShell 5 problem in the traditional windows console. \r\n\r\nBy default Windows PowerShell changes the console colour \"Dark Magenta\" in the old-style Windows console  to a shade of blue, and makes that the background colour. \r\nLooking at the screen shots, the file name is being output in .... Dark Magenta. \r\n\r\nif you use $host.UI.RawUI.BackgroundColor = \"black\"  and then run the command you'll see the text - to get it display in magenta you need to go to the console properties and set the 6th colour back to a dark magenta. \r\n\r\nIf you use PowerShell core (6 or 7) or if you run Windows PowerShell in the new Windows Terminal the text will be visible (although not very visible on Windows PowerShell's blue background). \r\n  ",
