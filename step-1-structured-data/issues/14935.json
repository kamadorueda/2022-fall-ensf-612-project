      "body": "The problem is that `(Get-Variable).Name` includes the `$?` variable.  However, `?` is a wildcard character for a single character.  So the cmdlet creates a collection of patterns based on `-exclude` which includes `?` matching any single character variable.  Since `-Exclude` explicitly accepts wildcard characters, this seems to be be-design.",
