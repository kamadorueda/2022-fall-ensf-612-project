  "body": "Moving the discussion from  #2112\r\n\r\nWe should add simple accelerators for Files and Directories to ease their use within PowerShell. These accelerators should throw if the provided file or directory do not exist. It should be considered whether or not these should support be PSProvider aware.\r\n\r\nOne concern is that using `[file]` would be ambiguous with `using namespace System.IO`. For that purpose, my examples will tentatively use the `[PSFile]` accelerator. The accelerator names should be discussed here as well\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usage would work something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Widget {\r\n    param([PSFile]$File)\r\n    # Do something with $File\r\n}\r\nGet-Widget -File 'x:\\no\\lo\\existo.nope'\r\n# parameter binding error for non existent file\r\nGet-Widget -File 'c:\\some\\real\\file.txt'\r\n# works with existing file\r\n\r\n$file = [PSFile]'x:\\no\\lo\\existo.nope'\r\n# type conversion error on non existing file\r\n\r\n$file = [PSFile]'c:\\some\\real\\'\r\n# type conversion error on container\r\n\r\n$file = [PSFile]'c:\\some\\real\\file.txt'\r\n# no error\r\n\r\n$File = [PSFile](Get-Item 'c:\\some\\real\\file.txt')\r\n# no error\r\n\r\n$File = [PSFile][System.IO.FileInfo]'c:\\some\\real\\file.txt'\r\n# no error\r\n\r\n$file = [PSFile][System.IO.FileInfo]'x:\\no\\lo\\existo.nope'\r\n# type conversion error on non existing file\r\n```\r\n\r\nSomething similar would work for `[PSDirectory]`\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Directory = [PSDirectory]'c:\\some\\real\\file.txt'\r\n# type conversion error on non-container\r\n\r\n$Directory = [PSDirectory]'x:\\no\\lo\\'\r\n# type conversion error on non existing folder\r\n\r\n$Directory = [PSDirectory]'c:\\some\\real\\'\r\n# no error\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nIf this supported providers, the API for `PSFile` would need to look something like\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic object BaseObject { get; }\r\npublic string Name { get; }\r\npublic string FullName { get; }\r\npublic PSDirectory Directory { get; }\r\npublic string DirectoryName { get; }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`BaseObject` would store the System.IO.FileInfo` or whatever item type a PS Provider returns from `get-item`.",

It is to eliminate this logic which is everywhere:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n    param (\r\n        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]\r\n        [ValidateScript({\r\n            if(-not (Test-Path $_)){\r\n                throw\r\n            }\r\n        })]\r\n        [string]\r\n        $File\r\n    )\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam(\r\n    [PSFile]$File\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe a type is probably the best implementation.

Today we use a `string` to refer to file that:\r\n\r\n* exist\r\n* might exist\r\n* might not exist\r\n* will be created if they don't exist\r\n* etc.\r\n\r\nAlso worth noting - your proposed type has a false promise - even if the file exists when the instance is constructed, it might not when accessing the file (it shouldn't prevent the file from being deleted.)  In other words, good error reporting is not solved by use of this type.\r\n\r\nI am curious if you can point to an example of your proposed type in another environment - it feels like it's not a real (easily solvable) problem, because if it was, I'd expect .Net to already have such a type. For example, `System.IO.Path` feels like the right name for the type you want, but that's a static utility class.",

But if there is no escaping than, then there wouldn't be any benefit.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm just trying to flesh out something that was kind of an one-off comment brought up in #2112. Making `[System.IO.FileInfo]` accessible as `[FileInfo]` is still an improvement, but it just leaves so much off the table like files on a ps providers.\r\n\r\n> I  am curious if you can point to an example of your proposed type in another environment \r\n\r\nI don't have one. I thought I did, but I must have imagined this existing in other languages.",
