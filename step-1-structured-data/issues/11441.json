If you have a long running script, that does select-object on a global PSCustomObject array e.g. every 60 seconds, it will fill up all your machine's ram within 24 hours.\r\n\r\nRegarding issue #7768, I stumbled upon this issue during my search for the memory leak. Actually, that one addresses the use of `-ExpandProperty` and `-Property` - if using select-object with one or both of those parameters, the memory leak does not happen. Most probably, because a new object will be forwarded through the pipeline.\r\n\r\nIt's happening only, when using blank select-object or positional select-object, which should simply forward a selection of the original objects",
