  "body": "Is it possible to exit a disconnected or otherwise broken remote powershell session?  I have one open where every command I enter, I get:\r\n\r\nStarting a command on the remote server failed with the following error message : Authorization failed For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.\r\n\r\nThat includes \"Exit-PSSession\", \"exit\", \"Get-PSSession\", \"^C\", \"^break\", \"esc-\\\", \"^\\\", \"^D\"...\r\n\r\nThis is from Linux to Windows, without using ssh.  If I open a new pwsh, I can't see the session from this one.\r\n\r\nIs there a hotkey or something to terminate an inner remote shell?  I searched around and couldn't find anything.  On ssh from Linux to Linux, if you hit\r\n~.\r\nat any time, it will disconnect the ssh session and return you to your host prompt.  ~& backgrounds the ssh process, but leaves it running.  Is there any equivalent for powershell core?",
