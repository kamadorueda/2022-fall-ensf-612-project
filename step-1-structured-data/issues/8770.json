Console is running without PSReadline.\r\n\r\nTab Completion of d-na does complete to Disable-NetAdapter\r\nPSReadLine cannot be added to session and execution Policy is set to restricted and I have to set the scope to Bypass to load PSReadline after which I can use d-na tab completion and PSReadline\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6355225/51871725-16000780-234f-11e9-969c-5c4184a12e06.png)\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0-preview.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0-preview.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763 \r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```",
