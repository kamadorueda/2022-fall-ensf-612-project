This Pull Request aims to bring that same kind of functionality to `Update-FormatData`. \r\n\r\n- [x] Add a parameterset for adding strongly typed format view definitions to the current session. (-TypeName and -FormatViewDefinition parameters)\r\n- [x] Add a test for this.\r\n- [x] Add a parameterset for dynamically adding format view definitions (-TypeName, -ListProperties, - TableProperties, -WideProperty and -DefaultView [Table | List | Wide])\r\n- [x] Add a test for dynamic loading of format view definitions.\r\n- [ ] Look into deduplicating format data entries in db.\r\n- [ ] Add more tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nI wanted to format objects in PowerShell, but found out that can only be done reliably through providing a .ps1xml file. \r\nThere is no easier way. I wrote about that here: https://joskw.gitbook.io/blog/object_formatting\r\nAnd I found this issue #7845, which describes the problem.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.

Couple of notes:\r\n1) \"WIP\" must be removed from PR title (and corresponding checkbox in PR Checklist checked) before anybody will start in-depth review of the code. This is just this repo's process. \"WIP\" means \"code changes in PR are not complete / not ready for review\" therefore it does not make sense for people to spend time reviewing \"WIP\" PRs.\r\n2) \"Documentation needed\" is checked; in addition please follow that link and file an issue (something like \"Need to document new Update-FormatData parameters\") in [PowerShell-Docs repository](https://github.com/powershell/powershell-docs/) that links back to this PR; and add the link to that doc issue in \"Issue filed:\"\r\n3) what is meant by  \"Look into deduplicating format data entries in db.\" ?\r\n\r\nPS. Thank you for picking up this work.",
