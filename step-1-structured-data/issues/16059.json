  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRelated: #14594 and #16060\r\n\r\nWhile setting the `TERM` environment variable to `'dumb'`  does make `$host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal` report `$false`, the output-formatting system still uses VT (ANSI) escape sequences and produces colored output.\r\n\r\nNote: Unlike setting `TERM` to `xtermm` / `xterm-mono`, `dumb` does _not_ cause `$PSStyle.OutputRendering` to reflect `PlainText` (arguably, if PowerShell knows that the terminal doesn't support VT (ANSI) escape sequences, it shouldn't  use them, irrespective of the value of `$PSStyle.OutputRendering`).\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# On Unix\r\nsh -c 'TERM=dumb pwsh -c ''Get-Item /'''\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe output shouldn't be colored.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe output is colored.\r\n\r\nNote: On Windows, the equivalent `$env:TERM='dumb'; pwsh -nop -c 'Get-Item /'` command doesn't render the colors, but outputs the escape sequences as-is, with the ESC char. represented as `\u2190`\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.9\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
