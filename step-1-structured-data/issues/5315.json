  "body": "The crossgen issue dotnet/coreclr#9745 that causes parser test to hang has been fixed in 2.0.4-servicing preview packages, and we have updated powershell project files to build against that runtime (see PR #5295). So now we need to revert the previous workaround in our CI/test scripts, so that we always run crossgen in our CI build and run tests with the crossgen'ed assemblies.\r\n",
