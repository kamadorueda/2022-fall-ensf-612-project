  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nIt appears the help topic for a parameter on New-ModuleManifest is incorrect. I can't be sure, but it doesn't look like the text goes with the parameter\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Help New-ModuleManifest -Parameter CompatiblePSEditions\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nN/A\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nGet-Help returns text for the parameter CompatiblePSEditions that does not appear to match the parameter name. \r\n```none\r\n-CompatiblePSEditions <String[]>\r\n    You can use this parameter to restrict the aliases that are exported by the module. It can remove aliases from the list of\r\n    exported aliases, but it cannot add aliases to the list.\r\n\r\n    If you omit this parameter, New-ModuleManifest creates an AliasesToExport key with a value of * (all), meaning that all aliases\r\n    that are exported by the module are exported by the manifest.\r\n\r\n    Required?                    false\r\n    Position?                    named\r\n    Default value                None\r\n    Accept pipeline input?       False\r\n    Accept wildcard characters?  false\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS>( ( $PSVersionTable.GetEnumerator() | ForEach-Object { ( '{0,26} : {1,-20}' -f $PSItem.Key,($PSItem.Value -join ', ') ) } ) | Out-String -Width 100 ) | Set-Clipboard\r\n                 PSVersion : 5.1.15063.608       \r\n                 PSEdition : Desktop             \r\n      PSCompatibleVersions : 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.1.15063.608\r\n              BuildVersion : 10.0.15063.608      \r\n                CLRVersion : 4.0.30319.42000     \r\n         WSManStackVersion : 3.0                 \r\n PSRemotingProtocolVersion : 2.3                 \r\n      SerializationVersion : 1.1.0.1             \r\n\r\n```\r\n",

I looked to see if this was a known issue and it looks like our doc writer already fixed it (in the repo).  In this case, there wasn't an existing issue in that repo, so I just looked at the [actual doc](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/5.1/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/New-ModuleManifest.md) (it's under the `reference` folder) and it was already changed.",
