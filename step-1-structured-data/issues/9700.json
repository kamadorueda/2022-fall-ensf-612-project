  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nToday, PSRP over SSH is hard coded to establish a regular SSH connection.  This prevents scenarios of connecting to a machine behind a firewall that would otherwise be able to use a SSH Reverse Tunnel.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nNeed some PSSessionOptions to tell PSRP to do a second hop connection from the public ip to the reverse tunnel port along with any different credentials than those used from the initial hop to the gateway.\r\n\r\ncc @TylerLeonhardt @PaulHigin \r\n",
