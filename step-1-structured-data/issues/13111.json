  "body": "I am using Powershell SDK through c# code to gather information on Network Adapters. I am getting most of the information corretly. Here correctly means command returns same results for Windows Powershell 5.1. (Most of the properties returned are null/empty which is ok. The only case is Status property. \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-ExecutionPolicy with Parameters Force:true,ExecutionPolicy:remotesigned,scope:process\r\nGet-NetAdapter\r\n```\r\nOn the returned PSObject collection, I can get all other properties correctly (such as Name). \r\nHowever difference is when I ran the code: (string)obj.Properties.Match(\"Status\")[0].Value.\r\nI checked the property value is  string.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nI expect string values such as Up, Disconnected which is what I get when I ran the command from Powershell Console.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nI receive null\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n```none\r\nPSVersion=7.0.2\r\nPSEdition=Core\r\nWSManStackVersion=3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion=2.3\r\n```\r\n",

Windows Powershell returns Strings whereas PowershellSDK returns integer values. Parsing as integer solved the problem. I dont think this change is documented. Can we put it so somebody else does not spend time on this?",
