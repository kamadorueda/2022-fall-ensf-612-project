  "body": "Hi,\r\nI didn't find any info on this issue at all, I have no result when looking for the error code (2689860592).\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInstall Powershell 7.1 on a local and remote computer (I tried both with msi installer and windows store), enable WinRM on both computer (via Enable-PSRemoting)\r\nThen set $PSSessionConfigurationName to the value \"Powershell.7\" (or \"Powershell.7.1.0\", or anything that get returned by Get-PSSessionConfiguration).\r\nThen try to login via \r\n```\r\n$cred=Get-Credential;\r\nEnter-PSSession -ComputerName XXX -Credential ${cred}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that it also happens with Powershell 5.1 on the client side. It looks like an issue on the server side.\r\nI also reproduce it on several machine (all with Windows 10 Pro, 20H1 and 20H2)\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nEnterPSSession gives a prompt for Pwsh 7\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```\r\nEnter-PSSession: Connecting to remote server PC-VINCENT failed with the following error message : <f:WSManFault xmlns:f=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/wbem/wsman/1/wsmanfault\" Code=\"2689860592\" Machine=\"PC-VINCENT\"><f:Message><f:ProviderFault provider=\"PowerShell.7\" path=\"C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\PowerShell\\7.1.0\\pwrshplugin.dll\"></f:ProviderFault></f:Message></f:WSManFault> For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is no info on about_Remote_Troubleshooting. \r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\nOn the client :\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the server (I get them by connecting via ssh) :\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

If we put it into the \"Administrators\" group instead the connection works.\r\n\r\nThis is not ideal, since we are required by company guidelines to limit each users permissions as much as possible and \"Administrators\" is the exact opposite of that.",
