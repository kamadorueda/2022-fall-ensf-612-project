  "body": "Related: #15239, #15250, #15261 - see overview in #15143.\r\n\r\nA parameter-like argument (prefixed with `-`) that ends in `:` (colon) is unexpectedly merged with the following argument.\r\n\r\nFor instance, this can break `awk` calls on Unix that use `-F:` to specify `:` as the field separator - see steps below.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, the problem can be demonstrated thus:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> cmd /c echo -F: bar  # Simplest repro on Unix: /bin/echo -F: bar\r\n-F:bar  # !! Missing space between '-F:' and 'bar'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: In _PowerShell_ parameter binding, `-Foo: bar` and `-Foo:bar` are equivalent, but this isn't appropriate when calling _external programs_.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun on **Linux or macOS** (but the problem also affects Windows), with  `PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` in effect (and preference variable `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` set to `'Standard'`):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Run an awk command that extracts the usernames from /etc/passwd\r\n$sb = { cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1 }'  | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty }\r\n\r\n# In legacy mode, the command succeeds\r\n& { $PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing = 'Legacy'; & $sb }\r\n\r\n# In standard mode (the new mode enable with the experimental feature), the command breaks:\r\n& $sb\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests should pass.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe second test fails, because distinct arguments `-F:` and `'{print $1}'` were unexpectedly merged into a _single_ argument with verbatim content `-F:{print $1}`:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n# ... awk error message / usage info, due to the command having become syntactically invalid.\r\nInvalidResult: Expected a value, but got $null or empty.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.5\r\n```\r\n",
