  "body": "I've noticed occasions where PowerShell continues to show a progress bar despite that the activity has completed.  That can be merely confusing on short runs, but it becomes inscrutable for long-running scripts because the progress bars eventually accumulate until they fill most of the console and then jump around (see also #7507).  \r\n\r\nIn some cases a progress bar remains because the offending command simply does not write a \"Completed\" record.  That can be determined by examining PowerShell.Streams.Progress.  In this case, however, it looks to me that correctly-formatted \"Completed\" records are indeed written to the progress stream.\r\n\r\n1. In what conditions should I expect PowerShell to stop displaying a progress bar?  Is it simply a \"Completed\" record with a matching ActivityId?  Or are there other conditions that also have to be met?\r\n2.  Why do the progress bars accumulate when invoking `Backup-SqlDatabase` but do not accumulate when paying back the same records via `Write-Progress`?\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n_Note: I had originally posted a repro that wasn't portable.
