  "body": "The Manifest [module type](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.moduletype?redirectedfrom=MSDN&view=powershellsdk-1.1.0) came up in Pester/Pester#934.  I have been trying to understand what, exactly, this module type is, and how its behavior differs from a Script-type module.  Note that [this page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878337(v=vs.85).aspx) includes the following statements:\r\n\r\n> RootModule: ...Possible types for the root module can be empty (which will make this a Manifest module)...\r\n> NestedModules: ... In addition to other modules, you may also load script (.ps1) files here. These files will execute in the context of the root module. (This is equivalent to dot sourcing the script in your root module.)...\r\n\r\nI have the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. What is the purpose of a Manifest-type module?\r\n2. Why are Manifest-type modules distinguished from Script-type modules?\r\n3. Why isn't a module whose manifest has `RootModule` empty and has only `.ps1` files in `NestedModules` simply considered a Script-type module?\r\n4. In what ways does a Script-type module behave differently from a Manifest-type module whose NestedModules are all `.ps1` files?\r\n5. In the case where `RootModule` is empty, what is \"the context of the root module\" that `.ps1` files from `NestedModules` are executed in?",
