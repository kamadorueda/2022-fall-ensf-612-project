  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n`Set-Content -Path test -Stream com.dropbox.ignored -Value 1` fails with `Set-Content: Unable to clear content of 'C:\\Users\\...\\Dropbox\\test' because it is a directory. Clear-Content is only supported on files.`\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nThe Set-Content command should succeed.\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to set the content of a stream for a folder like this - apparently this was working in older versions of PS; it is the recommended way of ignoring folders for Dropbox (https://help.dropbox.com/files-folders/restore-delete/ignored-files).\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> C:\\Users\\...\\Dropbox> Set-Content -Path test -Stream com.dropbox.ignored -Value 1\r\nSet-Content: Unable to clear content of 'C:\\Users\\...\\Dropbox\\test' because it is a directory. Clear-Content is only supported on files.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22449\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
