      "body": "While working on # 10401, I was thinking over the idea that maybe we should initialize not to Directory.CurrentDirectory(), but to a value from the parent runspace (both provider and current location), but I came to the conclusion that users often don\u2019t understand that many of pwd values \u200b\u200bcan exist (one per runspace) and as a result we will only complicate things and confuse users even more.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that when users create runspaces manually, they have the same behavior (ForEach-Object -Parallel) for many years. (I don't understand why we ignore this many years but want change this for ForEach-Object -Parallel.)\r\nChanging this either way would be a huge breaking change.\r\n\r\nAlso there is a problem with $Home in Snap and AppX. It would be more reliable to have Start-ThreadJob initilized to current location too. A script that runs on a regular system may suddenly not work in Snap and AppX #9278 /cc @PaulHigin.\r\n\r\nTaking into account that users often do not understand how this works, waiting for a certain initial value cannot be considered reliable practice and we should recommend always setting current location explicitly.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "This is pure ergonomics question. Sure when somebody uses runspaces and writes 3 non-obvious lines to create a new runspace and control a lot of things about how it's created, it's reasonable to expect to set the location explicitly. When you have a `%` loop and realize that it can speed up by parallelization, it would be nice to change as little as possible after adding `-Parallel`. I don't think that people would know they need the parallelization before actually writing and trying the code for a normal foreach. So less friction is it to include `-Parallel` the better.\r\n\r\n> Changing this either way would be a huge breaking change.\r\n\r\n`ForEach -Parallel` haven't been realized in any stable build yet - I don't see changing behavior of it as a breaking change. The behavior of it doesn't need to match the runspace creation 1:1.",

      "body": "Last days I was somewhere deep in PowerShell code :-) so my comment was from that side.\r\nIf look from user side I full agree.\r\n\r\nSo we have two rules:\r\nrule A - \"new runspace inherits current provider and location\".\r\nrule B that \"new runspace has FileSystem provider default and Directory.CurrentDirectory location\". \r\n\r\nI am sure that we should have single rule and it is rule A so as not to mislead users and fix all three cases.\r\nWe could expose this as new experimental feature.\r\nI think there are not problems with -Parallel and Start-ThreadJob. As for Start-Job defaulting to $Home it looks like a bug (\"I am on my working dir but a job puts results to home dir\". also there could be problems in containers as mentioned aboved) and we should fix it.",

I've created an issue for it: https://github.com/PaulHigin/PSThreadJob/issues/46\r\n\r\nHowever, given that for `Start-Job` it is a _fixed_ directory, users are much more likely to have come to depend on it.\r\n\r\nGiven that experimental features are an \"on-ramp\" for regular features, how do you see that transition unfolding?\r\n\r\nEven if users adopt the experimental feature in significant enough numbers, turning it into a regular feature can still break existing code if it is turned into a regular feature.\r\n\r\n",
