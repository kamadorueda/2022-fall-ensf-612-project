Basically, that we shouldn't ship a new one unless we had a reason to pick up the new stuff. \r\n\r\nIt may very well be the case that we need to do that, but I'd like Jim to come in and make sure I've got the  history right first.

Lot's of excellent improvements; First and foremost handling our cross-plat needs, but it's not completely backwardly compatible, and I get more than 100 test failures when I run our tests using 4.0.8. I've got a big bunch of them fixed and *all* of those are test issues, but it's taking a bit of time to track them all down.\r\n\r\nThe issues boil down to a couple of things - missing/changed assertions (Contains/FileContentMatch), `Be` actually working against arrays (_awesome_), and tests which never actually worked, and because error checking has improved to catch them, like `Should Throw` which now complains if it doesn't get a scriptblock, those tests are properly failing.\r\n\r\nI do look forward to the time when we can just grab this and dump our submodule and it shouldn't be too long now. @dlwyatt Is there any thought of making this a `nupkg`?",
