      "body": "@vors #495 is porting the Nano host to Linux. However, it will really only replace `main.cs`. Its UI implementation (the readline, ui, rawui, etc.) does not utilize `System.Console`; instead it P/Invokes to Windows native APIs. So even after porting the Nano host... most of it will be replaced with what we already have.\n\nI still have reservations about \"porting\" the Nano host, because ours is already (seemingly) close to feature-parity. I'd like to determine what managed code only features are available in the Nano that we don't have, before deciding which host to use as the primary one.\n",
