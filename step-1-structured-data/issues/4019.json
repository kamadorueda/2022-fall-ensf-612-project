  "body": "Previously powershell.exe treated unknown arguments as a command line to execute.  To align with POSIX so that things like shebang scripts work correctly, we are changing powershell.exe so that it treats unknown arguments (aka positional argument) as a file.  This means that `powershell foo` will now attempt to use `foo` as a PowerShell script whereas previously `foo` would be treated as a command to execute.  This doesn't affect existing usage of either `-File` nor `-Command`.  Fixed tests that didn't explicitly use `-Command` parameter.\r\n\r\nNote that some of the changes below for trailing whitespace was due to VSCode setting.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1103\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3959",
