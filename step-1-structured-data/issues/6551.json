This is by design to reduce the chance to killing the wrong process - a non-recoverable operation - **and should not change**.  Simply specifying the process name does not guarantee uniqueness. On the other hand, `Get-Process` binds to `-Name` because that is most useful. `Get-Process -Id` is much less common. I suppose we could change `Get-Process` but I don't see that there is sufficient utility hear to warrant taking a breaking change",

      "body": "Thanks, @lzybkr. \r\nI see that you've since abandoned the idea of positional use of PIDs there, and a helpful error message is definitely the next best thing in that case.\r\n  \r\nNote that `Wait-Process`, which does support `Wait-Process <pid>`, decides whether argument should bind to `-ID` purely _formally_, based on the parameter declarations (no fallback logic based on whether something that is found not to exist as a name exists as a PID) - if it can be parsed as an `[int]` (array), it binds to `-ID`, otherwise to `-Name`.\r\n\r\nThis behavior makes sense to me (it is easily explained and easy to remember), and while it is obviously less dangerous in `Wait-Process` than in `Stop-Process`, I think worrying about all-digit executable filenames is too exotic a scenario to forgo that convenience, especially since you can always disambiguate with `-Id` vs. `-Name`.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nReturning to (also) defaulting to `-Name`  with `Stop-Process`:\r\n\r\nHere's the very first example from [`Get-Help Stop-Process`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/edit/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Management/Stop-Process.md):\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n### Example 1: Stop all instances of a process\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\> Stop-Process -Name \"notepad\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis command stops all instances of the Notepad process on the computer.\r\nEach instance of Notepad runs in its own process.\r\nIt uses the *Name* parameter to specify the processes, all of which have the same name.\r\nIf you were to use the *Id* parameter to stop the same processes, you would have to list the process IDs of each instance of Notepad.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis tells me two things:\r\n\r\n* The behavior of `Stop-Process -Name` is well-documented and clearly indicates that _all_ matching processes will be stopped.\r\n\r\n* Using `Stop-Process -Name` is not an exotic use case.\r\n\r\nSo, if `Get-Process Notepad` is the same as `Get-Process -Name Notepad`, then it is reasonable to expect that `Stop-Process Notepad` is the same as `Stop-Process -Name Notepad`.\r\n\r\nThis _not_ being the case amounts to nothing but a puzzling inconvenience; it is _not_ educational, and _not_ recognizable as a safety measure.\r\n\r\nIn fact, until @BrucePay framed it as a safety feature, that had never even crossed my mind - despite my knowing of the  implications (potentially killing _multiple_ processes).\r\n",
