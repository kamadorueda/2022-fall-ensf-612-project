  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a developer consuming NuGet packages, I want the license terms of each package to remain readable and immutable after I have reviewed them. However, PowerShell NuGet packages such as [Microsoft.PowerShell.Security](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/7.1.0-preview.3) currently have <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/LICENSE.txt> as `licenseUrl` in the package metadata. The license terms referenced by such a URL can be changed, and the URL may stop working if the branch is renamed (as requested in <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12951>).\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nNuGet has deprecated `licenseUrl` (<https://github.com/NuGet/Announcements/issues/32>). The `license` property should be used instead, presumably here: <https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/ab7460365ffdd40e1c3ae67958a27f210c6b594a/tools/packaging/packaging.strings.psd1#L137>",
