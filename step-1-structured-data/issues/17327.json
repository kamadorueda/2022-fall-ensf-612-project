I feel the count check can be removed and the filter can still be tested by checking that the filtered event Id is present.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nTests to always pass\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nTests randomly fail\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
