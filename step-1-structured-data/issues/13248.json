      "body": "Yikes.  Good find.  It does look like it is a temporary disabling of this idle timeout fix up code.  It also appears to have always been in the Core code base, and is there when first forked from Windows PowerShell.  I strongly dislike this kind of code, especially without any comment to indicate why it is there and why it is disabled.\r\n\r\nThe fix up code appears to order setting WSMan drive idle/maxidle timeout values to ensure an error occurs if idle exceeds maxidle.  It seems way over complex, which may be why it is disabled.\r\n\r\nMy inclination is to remove this code since the behavior has been like this for a long time, and there have been no complaints.",
