  "body": "> A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version.\n\nhttp://semver.org/\n### Two things I'd propose improving.\n\nFirst, current releases on MyGet are being labelled badly. For instance, SMA is \"1.0.0-alpha10\" or \"1.0.0-alpha9\" ... \n1. I'm pretty sure that should be 6.0.0?\n2. I think the pre-release section should be -alpha.9 and -alpha.10 \n\nSecond, the `System.Management.Automation.SemanticVersion` built into PowerShell 6 can't sort pre-releases into the right order ... because it treats everything on the end as a _single_ text label and sorts them alphabetically (so, like Visual Studio, it thinks the \"1.0.0-alpha9\" is newer than \"1.0.0-alpha10\").\n",
