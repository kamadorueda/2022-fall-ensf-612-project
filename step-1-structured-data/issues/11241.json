      "body": "Short version: This looks like a manifestation of a bug in `CertificateProvider` - loading `pki` module on every operation with a certificate path. Wincompat's warning just made this visible.\r\n\r\nLong version: When creating new items or getting existing certificate items [CertificateProvider auto-imports `pki` module based on it's internal flag `_hasAttemptedToLoadPkiModule`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/2ee9df5a5d007167628db56454bb555b8f9932cd/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/security/CertificateProvider.cs#L1099).\r\nThis `_hasAttemptedToLoadPkiModule` flag is set to `false` only once - [in CertificateProvider's constructor](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/2ee9df5a5d007167628db56454bb555b8f9932cd/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/security/CertificateProvider.cs#L517).\r\nHowever, `SessionStateInternal.GetProviderInstance` simply creates a new instance of the provider every time, therefore resetting `_hasAttemptedToLoadPkiModule` flag which subsequently causes `pki` module to be re-imported again.\r\n\r\nHere is the call stack that resets the `_hasAttemptedToLoadPkiModule` flag during `PS Cert:\\> ls` call:\r\n```\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Commands.CertificateProvider.CertificateProvider() Line 517\r\nSystem.RuntimeType.CreateInstanceDefaultCtor(bool publicOnly, bool skipCheckThis, bool fillCache, bool wrapExceptions)\r\nSystem.Activator.CreateInstance(System.Type type, bool nonPublic, bool wrapExceptions)\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.ProviderInfo.CreateInstance() Line 571\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.SessionStateInternal.GetProviderInstance(System.Management.Automation.ProviderInfo provider) Line 284\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.SessionStateInternal.GetContainerProviderInstance(System.Management.Automation.ProviderInfo provider) Line 604\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.SessionStateInternal.GetChildItems(string path, bool recurse, uint depth, System.Management.Automation.CmdletProviderContext context) Line 1491\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.ChildItemCmdletProviderIntrinsics.Get(string path, bool recurse, uint depth, System.Management.Automation.CmdletProviderContext context) Line 278\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetChildItemCommand.ProcessRecord() Line 318\r\n```",

It unify entry points to providers but this causes performance problems. It calls helper methods repeatedly many times. We have a tracking issue for FileSystem provider v2 and looking this I think we needs to change design and make entry points in base provider class to preserve unification and get high performance.\r\n",
