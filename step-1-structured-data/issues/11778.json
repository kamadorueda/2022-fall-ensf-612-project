  "body": "Hi,\r\nI am actually solving the situation of my DC server when some non-AD clients joins into my production LAN and receives IP address from DHCP server. I want to know about that situation. So I find out nice script on serverfault but it is not working properly for me. \r\n\r\nMy plan is: 1. prepare script for comparing clients in DHCP versus clients in AD when someone receive new IP address\r\n2. setup scheduled task if DHCP lease IP address\r\n3. be notificated via email about this situation\r\n\r\nProblem is that when DHCP lease the IP address I receive only empty email. Can anybody will help with it please? Thank you very much.\r\nHere is the script.\r\n\r\n ` Get-DhcpServerv4Lease -allleases -ScopeId \"192.168.140.0\" | Select-Object @{expression= {$_.hostname}; label='name' } | export-CSV -notypeinformation C:\\dhcp\\LeaseLog.csv\r\n\r\nimport-module activedirectory\r\n\r\n#get input CSV\r\n\r\n$leaselogpath = \"c:\\DHCP\\LeaseLog.csv\"\r\nImport-csv -path $leaselogpath | \r\n#query AD for computer name based on csv log\r\nforeach-object `\r\n{ \r\n   $ComputerName = $_.Name.Replace(\".mydomain.cz\",$null)\r\n   $NameResult = Get-ADComputer $ComputerName\r\n   $RogueSystem | Out-File C:\\DHCP\\RogueClients.txt -Append\r\n   $RogueSystem = $null\r\n\r\n}\r\nGet-Content C:\\DHCP\\RogueClients.txt | Select-Object -Unique | Out-File C:\\DHCP\\RogueClientsFinal.txt\r\nRemove-Item C:\\DHCP\\RogueClients.txt\r\n\r\n#send email to sysadmin\r\n$smtpserver = 192.168.140.40\r\n$from=\"myemail@mydomain.cz\"\r\n$to=\"myemail@mydomain.cz\"\r\n$subject=\"Non-AD joined DHCP clients\"\r\n$body= (Get-Content C:\\DHCP\\RogueClientsFinal.txt) -join '<BR>&nbsp;<BR>'\r\n$mailer = new-object Net.Mail.SMTPclient($smtpserver)\r\n$msg = new-object Net.Mail.MailMessage($from,$to,$subject,$body)\r\n$msg.IsBodyHTML = $true\r\n$mailer.send($msg)`",
