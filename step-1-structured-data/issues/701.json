  "body": "This is a cultural fit question.\nWe can take a foo.ps1 script and add #!/usr/local/bin/powershell and do a CHMOD +x and then it can be run from anywhere.  The Q is whether FROM POWERSHELL, a script should be required to have the +X in order to run.  \nMy undersanding is that all the other shells require this but I'm not sure about other scripting engines - what about Python, node.js etc - do they require +x to run scripts (from their language interpretor)?\n",
