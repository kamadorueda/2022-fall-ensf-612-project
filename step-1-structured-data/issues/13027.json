      "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestions. I have been using the 7.0.0 library for sometime and works like a charm. (Yes I did read and selected according to the mentioned article). I tested with both 7.0.2 and 7.0.0 and saw it only on 7.0.2. It looks like it is related to the linking stage and not the compilation and only for relase configuration.      \r\n\r\nI am not sure what changed (Yes I regulary clean obj and bin directories) but I can not reproduce the issue anymore. I will come back when it resurfaces.",
