  "body": "New issue at the request of @SteveL-MSFT in issue #6080 \r\n\r\nWhen upgrading between new versions of PowerShell any pinned Start Menu or Taskbar Icons are lost.\r\nIf you copy the shortcut from the Start Menu to anywhere else, such as the desktop, that icon also stops functioning following an upgrade.\r\n\r\nI believe the reason for this is because the path changes to the pwsh.exe changes after the upgrade due to the version being part of the file path for the pwsh.exe file.  E.G.\r\n\r\n* C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0-beta.9\\pwsh.exe\r\n* C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0-rc.2\\pwsh.exe\r\n* C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0\\pwsh.exe\r\n* C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.1\\pwsh.exe\r\n\r\nIdeally the version number folder should be removed or at least the pwsh.exe is moved into the PowerShell folder and the rest of the files remain in the version folder.  Also, is there a real need to keep the version number found on the shortcut that's placed into the Start Menu?\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n1. Uninstall PowerShell.\r\n2. Install [PowerShell 6.0.0](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.0.0/PowerShell-6.0.0-win-x64.msi).  \r\n3. Right click the 'PowerShell-6.0.0' shortcut and select 'Pin to Start' or/and 'Pin to taskbar'. \r\n4. Run the [PowerShell 6.0.1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.0.1/PowerShell-6.0.1-win-x64.msi) installer to perform an upgrade.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nFor the PowerShell icon to remain pinned and working after the upgrade.  \r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe one in the Start Menu disappears.  The one on the taskbar turns to a white default file icon which when clicked (Windows 10)...\r\n\r\n````none\r\n[Window Title]\r\nWindows\r\n\r\n[Main Instruction]\r\nCan't open this item\r\n\r\n[Content]\r\nIt might have been moved, renamed, or deleted.
