We've been talking to the Exchange Online team to make their cmdlets PS7 compatible. Work will happen, but it's up to them.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple closed issues regarding AzureRM and AzureAD that are getting the same error as described here.  Are you saying that Microsoft is \"talking\" to each of those teams to make their cmdlets compatible with PS7?  It doesn't look like anyone is really handling the AzureAD issue.  I see there is a upgrade path to AzureRM - but what about AzureAD?\r\n",
