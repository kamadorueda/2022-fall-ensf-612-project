  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nAs a user using the French keyboard layout, entering a forward slash (`Shift+:`) is _way more convenient_ than entering a backslash (`AltGr+8`). So using forward slashes throughout PowerShell has become muscle memory...\r\n\r\nThis works in most cases.\r\n\r\nAlas, tab expansion for inputs like\r\n\r\n````\r\n\\\\hostname\\x<TAB>\r\n````\r\n\r\nworks, but this doesn't:\r\n\r\n````\r\n//hostname/x<TAB>\r\n````\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
