  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nI recently tried to run R.exe in Powershell, I forgot to add it to path, and I accidentally found this. I guess it just a small thing but I suppose I should report it anyway.\r\nWhen I opened a new powershell instance on Windows terminal and typed in \"r\", powershell showed error:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Me> r\r\nInvoke-History: Cannot locate most recent history.\r\n```\r\nAnd I proceeded to type \"r\" again, this time powershell repeated \"r\" indefinitely until Windows terminal stack overflow.\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Me> r\r\n...\r\nr\r\nr\r\nr\r\nr\r\nr\r\nStack overflow.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nIt's also worth noting that this doesn't happen in Powershell 2.0 on Windows 7, so I expect it would behave in the same way.\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Me> r\r\nInvoke-History : Cannot locate last history.\r\nAt line:1 char:2\r\n+ r <<<<\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [Invoke-History], InvalidOperationException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvokeHistoryNoLastHistoryEntryFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeHistoryC\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Me> r\r\nr\r\nInvoke-History : The Invoke-History cmdlet is getting called in loop.\r\nAt line:1 char:2\r\n+ r <<<<\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (:) [Invoke-History], InvalidOperationException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvokeHistoryLoopDetected,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.InvokeHistoryCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nAs memtioned above,\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Me> r\r\nInvoke-History: Cannot locate most recent history.\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Me> r\r\nr\r\n...\r\nr\r\nr\r\nr\r\nStack overflow.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\nI also tried it on WSL 2 Ubuntu 18.04, same result.\r\n```powershell\r\n...\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\n...\r\nOS                             Linux 4.19.104-microsoft-standard\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\n...\r\n```",

But it was guarded against at one point, and the leftover v2 libs even on Windows 10 have the correct behaviour.",
