      "body": "Hi @logg-sar, I assume the same behaviour occurs in Windows PowerShell?\r\n\r\nIf so, the problem is that `Mount-DiskImage` has not been implemented to resolve paths.\r\n\r\n`Mount-DiskImage` is part of the [Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/storage/?view=win10-ps) module, and isn't part of PowerShell 6.2 (i.e. it's not in the codebase on GitHub here). Instead I believe the module comes with Windows, so the best option is to report this [here](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/295056-storage) and in Feedback Hub.",

Disappointing but true.\r\nI posted here because I know that the developers here hear the user and I hoped for a fix.\r\n\r\nWell....",
