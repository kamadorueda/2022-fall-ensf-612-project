  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThe concept is the ability to register a scriptblock for a specific native command to allow the scriptblock to parse the output and return objects.  A format.ps1xml would be optionally registered as a parameter to get nice formatting.\r\n\r\nThe assumption is that in most cases, if the parser is registered then the default is to use it so that objects are returned even though the native command itself returns text.  It might be ok to say if the command is last in the pipeline, it is ok to execute the parser.  If the next command in the pipeline is native, then text is expected.  If the next command is PowerShell, then execute the parser and pass objects down the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThere may still be a need to require text even when working with PowerShell in the pipeline, so need a way to specify that selectively.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nregister-outputparser -nativecommand kubectl -scriptblock { param($stdout, $args) ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\n`$stdout` as the first param would contain the text output, probably no streaming semantics\r\n`$args` is the args passed to the native command as an array of strings\r\n\r\nif the scriptblock determines it can't process the data it should just return $stdout back out\r\n",

It also seems really difficult for a user who *doesn't* have an output parser registered to see what's going on.

Wouldn't output of these parsers would still be the same output as my function example? (i.e. whatever the parser author outputs)",

The problem is that the output of native commands varies wildly based on the parameters used as well as the immediate environment. This makes it extremely difficult to write a general purpose text-to-object converter. Even a purpose-built converter is very hard (IIRC we tried doing this with `ipconfig.exe` but never shipped it.)",

The idea here is if someone just wanted to get objects from `kubectl cluster-info dump` and is able to write a parser for it, then they could register just for that similar to registering argument completers.  The point of when you really want the text output is a concern particularly when the heuristics I indicated aren't sufficient.  Haven't thought of any good idea that doesn't include a sigil or some other indicator that would be hard to discover (like `--%`...)",

Nobody should be surprised by this behaviour, and it should not take over standard native command executions.\r\n\r\nSince we're talking about a `Register-OutputParser` cmdlet anyway, I think we should pair it with an invocation command, an explicit opt-in to this kind of behaviour. Something like `Invoke-NativeCommand` with paired with @tnieto88's cmdlet name suggestion.\r\n\r\nBut taking a step back for a minute, I'm pretty sure this kind of feature will largely go unused. Defining a custom function or even a cmdlet with the appropriate parameters and features will always fit better in the PowerShell ecosystem. This feels like a half-solution at best.",
