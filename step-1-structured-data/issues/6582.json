      "body": "@PaulHigin Yeah, I also thought about this, and wondered why didn't VS Code just take advantage of the existing `PSISERemoteSessionOpenFile` related code in PowerShell (`HostUtilities` and `RemoteServerHost`), but chose to reinvent the wheel ...\r\n\r\nI already raised a question at PowerShell/PowerShellEditorServices#652. If it turns out the existing related code can be reused by VS Code, then we can clean up the editor service code. If it's by design that the powershell extension has to go with a different approach, then we can remove the related code in PS Core.",
