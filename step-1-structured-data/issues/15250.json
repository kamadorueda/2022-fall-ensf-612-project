  "body": "Similar to #15239, this issue would be resolved by the proposal in #15143. See also: #15261 and #15276\r\n\r\nNote that high-profile CLIs such as `az` and `npm` (Node.js's package manager), for script-based utilities that come with packages, use batch files as their entry points.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the following on Windows:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Switch to a temporary directory.\r\nPush-Location -ea Stop ($tmpDir = (New-Item -Type Directory -Force (Join-Path Temp:/ $PID)).FullName)\r\n\r\n# Create a batch file that strips enclosing double quotes from the first argument and deduplicates the \r\n# embedded ones.\r\n@'\r\n@echo off & setlocal\r\nset Arg1=%~1\r\necho [%Arg1:\"\"=\"%] [%2]\r\n'@ > foo.cmd\r\n\r\n./foo.cmd 'Andre \"The Hawk\" Dawson' | Should -Be '[Andre \"The Hawk\" Dawson] []'\r\n\r\n# Clean up.\r\nPop-Location; Remove-Item $tmpDir -Recurse\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, because the argument with embedded `\"` isn't passed batch-file-appropriately - batch files (`cmd.exe`) do not recognize `\\\"` as an escaped `\"` and require `\"\"` instead:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nInvalidResult: Expected strings to be the same, but they were different. \r\nExpected length: 28 Actual length:   30 Strings differ at index 7. \r\nExpected: '[Andre \"The Hawk\" Dawson] []' \r\nBut was:  '[Andre \\\"The] [Hawk\\\" Dawson\"]'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote the literally retained `\\` and the unexpected breakup into _two_ arguments.\r\n\r\nFor this invocation to succeed it would have to pass verbatim `Andre \"The Hawk\" Dawson` as `\"Andre \"\"The Hawk\"\" Dawson\"` - i.e. escaping the embedded `\"` as `\"\"` rather than `\\\"` - on the command line used behind the scenes.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.5 on Windows\r\n```\r\n",
