For that reason, can you move all this content into /demos/remoting instead of the docs here? \n\nAlso, did you actually merge these changes up to `master`? I.e. do this actually work the alpha.9 bits? \n",

Jason feels we need a new-features document location which is why I added it there.  Please decide where this should go.\n",
