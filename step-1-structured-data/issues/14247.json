  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhereas:\r\n\r\n1. Both tmux and PowerShell are terminal-based applications\r\n1. tmux supports mouse events, such as click-and-drag to resize panes, select a window, and scroll through history\r\n1. PowerShell scripts could benefit from mouse interactions\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThis might be implemented using a PowerShell \"engine event.\"\r\n\r\n### Right-Click Event\r\n\r\nThe right-click event should include event data that describes the terminal coordinates of the click event.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRegister-EngineEvent -Action { Draw-ContextMenu -At $event.Coordinates } -SourceIdentifier [System.Management.Automation.PsEngineEvent]::RightClick\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Scroll Event\r\n\r\nThe scroll up/down event should include event data about the speed / length / height (???) of the scroll.\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n```\r\nRegister-EngineEvent -Action { GrabAndDisplay-SomeHistoricalLogData } -SourceIdentifier [System.Management.Automation.PsEngineEvent]::ScrollUp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Click Event\r\n\r\nThe click event should support both a single click and double-click events. Both should include terminal coordinates where the event occurred.\r\n\r\n```\r\nRegister-EngineEvent -Action { Perform-AnAction -At $event.Coordinates } -SourceIdentifier [System.Management.Automation.PsEngineEvent]::DoubleClick\r\n```",
