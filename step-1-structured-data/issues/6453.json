      "body": "At least at first glance the current behavior makes more sense, given that `[System.Data.DataTable]` does not implement the `[System.Collections.IEnumerable]` interface and PowerShell therefore doesn't consider it a collection.\r\n\r\nThat the behavior changed is definitely disconcerting, however, and I hope someone else can shed light on this.\r\n\r\nUsing `WriteObject(dt.Rows, enumerateCollection: true)` instead fixes the problem (because the  type of `.Rows` is `[System.Data.DataRowCollection]`, which _does_ implement `[IEnumerable]`) ",
