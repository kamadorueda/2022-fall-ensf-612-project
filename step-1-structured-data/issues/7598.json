  "body": "Client PSRP for Linux fails on a clean Debian 9 install of PowerShell due to the inability of libmi to resolve libssl and libcrypto.  While this worked as-is on Debian 8, Debian 9 fails unless symlinks for these two libraries are created in the $PSHOME directory.\r\n\r\nTo work around the problem, create the following symlinks in the PSHOME directory. Verify the version of ssl and crypto that are installed and adjust the references accordlingly.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.2 libssl.so.1.0.0\r\nsudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.2 libcrypto.so.1.0.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$uri = 'https://outlook.office365.com/powershell-liveid'\r\n$cred = Get-Credential\r\n$session = New-PSSession -ConnectionUri $uri  -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -Credential $cred -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nThe connection succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nThe following error is reported:\r\n\r\nThis parameter set requires WSMan, and no supported WSMan client library was found. WSMan is either not installed or unavailable for this system.\r\n",
