  "body": "Produce simple telemetry via Application Insights for the PowerShell Core console host.\r\n\r\nThis is limited to the console host and is not meant as generalized telemetry code for PowerShell Core. It will capture the GitCommitID and Platform Information when the console host starts. It enables opting out of sending telemetry. This does not include the changes required in setup to opt out of telemetry, which will be in a later PR.",

I did the following test with the semaphore file present and then not present:\r\n`measure-command { 1..60 | %{ ./powershell.exe -c \"exit\" }`\r\nthe average difference was about +2ms per invocation when the semaphore file was present. I'm happy to use other methodologies, just let me know what you would like to see.",
