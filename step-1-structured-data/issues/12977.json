  "body": "After installing Powershell 7.0.2, there is no longer an app icon in the Taskbar. Instead, there is a white rectangle, the standard placeholder icon. This is confirmed on two Windows 10 Pro machines. Screenshot below, followed by environment data.\r\n\r\nScreenshot. See the white rectangle next to the VS Code icon in the center. That's Powershell 7.0.2:\r\n\r\n![Powershell No Icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8071692/84898609-666b2880-b05c-11ea-9774-d236dda2fbaf.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n",

Then, the problem is gone in the next MSI.  \r\n\r\n@iSazonov The icons being removed is definitely not fixed in #12792.  The issue still existed there.\r\nUpdate: verified: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/3319f4cafc336ef5a65dedddf3a0ac1672e737dd/assets/files.wxs#L1958",
