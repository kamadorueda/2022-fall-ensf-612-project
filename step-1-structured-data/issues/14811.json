If the cmdlet `Get-Clipboard` requires installing `xclip` (gcb is a stub?), then what about `Set-Clipboard`? You can certainly use native utilities, but why then useless cmdlets?\r\n\r\n#### My Environment\r\nOS: KDE neon User Edition 5.20 x64\r\nPowerShell v7.1.2 (manual install: download, unpack, symlink to /usr/bin)\r\nxclip v0.13-1",

      "body": "`xclip` is used by _both_ commands, as it supports both copying to and retrieving from the clipboard.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Linux platforms is that they can have a variety of GUI shells (if any), so there's no single utility or API that provides clipboard access on all of them.\r\n\r\nThe X11-based [`xclip` utility](https://github.com/astrand/xclip) works on all GUI shells (desktops) that are [X11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System)-based, such as on Ubuntu, a popular Linux distro.\r\n\r\nWhile `xclip` may not be _preinstalled_, PowerShell does take advantage of it _if present_.\r\n\r\n> but why then useless cmdlets?\r\n\r\nAs a _multi-platform_ shell, PowerShell aims to provide commands that work the same on _all_ supported platforms.\r\n\r\nWith `xclip` present on a Linux distro, that aim is met (with respect to _text_ - see #14758).\r\n\r\nIn its absence, the aim is met to a _limited_ degree, via a _PowerShell-specific_ clipboard scoped to the _current session_. That is, you can _pair_ `Set-Clipboard`  and `Get-Clipboard` calls - and `Get-Clipboard` then only sees content copied by `Set-Clipboard`, not by other commands - though you won't have access to the platform's true, cross-process clipboard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
