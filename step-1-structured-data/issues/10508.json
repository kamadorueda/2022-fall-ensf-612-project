      "body": "Proxy functions came to mind for me as well, but maybe this should be a discussion about improving that experience.  I use proxy functions *a lot* in my profile, but I feel like I'm one of few because of how obtuse they are.  For instance, the above would have to be written as:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Out-StringWithStream {\r\n    [CmdletBinding(DefaultParameterSetName='NoNewLineFormatting', HelpUri='https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113368', RemotingCapability='None')]\r\n    param(\r\n        [ValidateRange(2, 2147483647)]\r\n        [int]\r\n        ${Width},\r\n\r\n        [Parameter(ParameterSetName='NoNewLineFormatting')]\r\n        [switch]\r\n        ${NoNewline},\r\n\r\n        [Parameter(ValueFromPipeline=$true)]\r\n        [psobject]\r\n        ${InputObject})\r\n\r\n    begin\r\n    {\r\n        try {\r\n            $outBuffer = $null\r\n            if ($PSBoundParameters.TryGetValue('OutBuffer', [ref]$outBuffer))\r\n            {\r\n                $PSBoundParameters['OutBuffer'] = 1\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            $PSBoundParameters.Add('Stream', [System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter]::Present)\r\n\r\n            $wrappedCmd = $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.GetCommand('Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\\Out-String', [System.Management.Automation.CommandTypes]::Cmdlet)\r\n            $scriptCmd = {& $wrappedCmd @PSBoundParameters }\r\n\r\n            $steppablePipeline = $scriptCmd.GetSteppablePipeline($myInvocation.CommandOrigin)\r\n            $steppablePipeline.Begin($PSCmdlet)\r\n        } catch {\r\n            throw\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    process\r\n    {\r\n        try {\r\n            $steppablePipeline.Process($_)\r\n        } catch {\r\n            throw\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    end\r\n    {\r\n        try {\r\n            $steppablePipeline.End()\r\n        } catch {\r\n            throw\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    <#\r\n\r\n    .ForwardHelpTargetName Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\\Out-String\r\n    .ForwardHelpCategory Cmdlet\r\n\r\n    #>\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYeah most of it is generated for you with `ProxyCommand.Create` but for new to intermediate folks, it'll be challenging to even figure out where to put `$PSBoundParameters.Add('Stream', [System.Management.Automation.SwitchParameter]::Present)`.\r\n\r\nI don't think `Set-Alias` is the place for something like that, but I'd *love* to see that made a lot easier.",

The tag ` Resolution-Answered` should be removed.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it's too complicated, as a lazy windows admin, I really dont like to write such ProxyCommand just to create an alias to a `cmdlet + params` ? And if I have 10 or more proxy commands to create ?\r\n\r\nThen, even for the powershell experts, when they remote connect to a server for a live troubleshooting, and that server only has the default cmdlets set, do they like to or have the time to write such thing ?\r\n\r\nBTW, in the Linux world, the alias can be redirected to anything already, it would be nice to port it to powershell.",

      "body": "My old [pspx](https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=pspx) module makes this easier. I could refresh that for PowerShell v.Current. It's one of those things where I felt like a rather extreme propeller head and wondered if anyone was actually using the functionality it provided, but it would allow for something like this:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nNew-ProxyFunction `\r\n    -CommandName Out-String `\r\n    -ProxyName Out-WithStringStream `\r\n    -RemoveParameter Stream `\r\n    -Begin {\r\n        $PSPassThruParameters.Add('Stream',$true) > $null\r\n    } `\r\n    -DefineNow\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know if you can actually get the code for that module from that link anymore, but I have it local, and started refreshing it a little while ago. I would need to think about how I would do the same thing if I were to design it for PowerShell today.\r\n\r\nEven with that though, there is definitely something to be said about associating an identifier (like an alias, but I think functions are better for this) with a command _plus_ a default set of parameter values, and having PowerShell know exactly what to do. It's quite a simple concept, really. My `New-ProxyFunction` command could do much, much more than that, but the simple case would be quite useful.\r\n\r\nWhat if the identifier was not an alias? What if we added a `New-Function` command that had one parameter set to simply define a function (like you can with `New-Item`, today, taking a name and a script block), and another parameter set that accepts a name, the name of a command you want to proxy, and a hashtable of parameters you want passed in by default. I wouldn't call that `New-ProxyFunction` -- the fact that it creates a proxy is a little beside the point, and the name shouldn't add complexity to what it does IMHO. I would just call it `New-Function`, and let the `-CommandToInvoke` parameter indicate that it's actually proxying something. That would allow for an even simpler syntax than what `pspx` provided, like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nNew-Function `\r\n    -Name Out-WithStringStream `\r\n    -CommandToInvoke Out-String `\r\n    -Parameters @{\r\n        Stream = $true\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince you can create proxy cmdlets, I wonder if I should just do that but create proxy cmdlets instead for better performance than proxy functions. \ud83e\udd14 ",
