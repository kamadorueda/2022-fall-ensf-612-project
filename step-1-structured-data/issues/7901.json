  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\n* Adds `y` suffix that is used to specify a numeric literal as the `sbyte` data type.\r\n  * Can be combined with the existing `u` suffix as `uy` to specify the `byte` data type\r\n* Adds tests to ensure the parsing for these works correctly.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> 100y\r\n100\r\nPS> 100y.GetType().FullName\r\nSystem.SByte\r\nPS> 100uy\r\n100\r\n100uy.GetType().FullName\r\nSystem.Byte\r\nPS> 300uy\r\n# Error: Invalid numeric literal\r\n```\r\n\r\nN.B.: I believe this will be a breaking change, as it means some command names (specifically, numerals suffixed with a y such as `100y`) will now be interpreted as numerals instead of potential function or command names.\r\n\r\nRef: #7557 -- This will resolve the first part of that issue. The second portion of that issue will be solved in a follow-up PR where binary literal support is added.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed - Issue link: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2965\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
