But when we talk of mastering the art of something, creating a masterpiece, performing Ibsen's The Master Builder, (or call someone a master-anything including a mastermind), of studying for a masters degree - where the person in charge of some colleges is known as the \"master\" or golfers playing in the masters I'd _really_ like to know if every use of \"master\" in English is causing upset to people whose heritage makes slavery a sensitive subject, or whether this is the same people who are crushed by embarrassment when using a phrase like \"I'll look into it\" when speaking to a blind person.  (I had a Uncle, now dead, who got angry when people used terms other than \"blind\" to describe his total lack of sight, I remember him shouting 'I'm not b----- visually impaired I'm _blind_!', and if people made a fuss about having used those kinds of metaphors he'd get similarly angry.

Changing an existing project and finding all the places the old name is embedded will come with a bunch of pain points, none of which will be insurmountable; so if there's genuine (not imagined) offence let's change it; if it's only imaginary the effort can be better used elsewhere. \r\n",

Master on its own is somewhat different, whether it is a master slide in PowerPoint or whatever. \r\n\r\n> @jhoneill I hear you (and I'm certainly not suggesting we **ban** the word \ud83d\ude05) but given that the word has been marred (specifically in the context of distributed systems) by widespread historical use to describe replication chains, I'd still argue we rename it.

In none of those cases is the master associated with a slave, but if it offends despite that, it should go.   \r\nIf people with disabilities start to say \"Look, PowerShell shouldn't have 'Disable' as an approved verb\" the able-bodied don't get a say ... etc. I think there is element of \"pre-emptive embarrassment\". ... \"What if this group are offended by this or that\" . \r\n\r\n\"Master\" is _only_ useful as a term for a branch in the sense of \"source of many copies\". My current gig is working in a place with some bad practice around [lack of] branching and _not_ having a branch named master on new projects would help that. (And if \"main\" , which is a fairly unhelpful name, or \"trunk\", which at least is the source-of-branches, become the norm we may avoid them too).  I don't quite understand your last line - master - or whatever the branch is named - should always produce a valid release, because if it doesn't branching from it and adding to it won't produce one. .\r\n    \r\nChanging what exists is harder, because every one of the 3300 forks of this repo need to be updated. I notice you still have master branches in your repos, and @vexx32 still has master in PSKoans, etc (and this isn't meant be snide, but I can't phrase it better) before proposing / supporting it for this it would be better to investigate the practicalities on repos you control - I'm guessing you saw Scott Hanselmann on this and read some of the comments about things breaking - nothing unfixable I'm sure, just more work than estimated.\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/i/blank.jpg\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>Blog by Carbon Five</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://blog.carbonfive.com/problematic-terminology-in-open-source/\">Problematic Terminology in Open-Source</a></strong></div><div>It remains a common practice in database systems today to refer to configurations where one database is a source of truth, and another database is a replica that follows the state of the source of \u2026</div></blockquote>",

I think there is room in the world for more than one view - I'm not convinced I'm right and even less sure others are wrong. There's a growing feeling that we should not use \"master/slave\", and I've watched two sides in a photography forum rage about the use for flash units - and there seems to be no common ground between the \"How dare anyone tell us to change\" and \"How can you keep using the those terms\" arguments.    \r\nBut \"Master\" isn't the troublesome one in that pair and has a variety of meanings from expert/teacher, to original source, to person in charge. Either _every use_ of the word evokes slavery, or _some don't_ and I _think_ you're with me that some don't.  I would say that use as a branch name is in the \"don't\" pile. \r\n\r\n> What _I'm_ saying is: Keep enjoying your masterpieces while watching Masterchef and signing up for a master class... and rename the default branch in this repository to something that's hopefully slightly more inclusive\r\n\r\nI do tend towards binary choices... If a _master-branch_ is not inclusive, why is a _master-class_ OK?  I would like some evidence that it makes any difference to inclusivity. Done right it's harmless, and pleases a few people but not the ones we're worried about excluding.  ",

This has made it extremely easy _for me_ to feel a \"part of the tribe\", but I genuinely fear that the overwhelmingly positive experience I've had is a mere a pipedream for someone who happens to _not_ look like me.

There's really no way to know, I was hoping that the present discussion would mean people who had a right to feel aggrieved would emerge and say either \"About Time Too!\" or \"Really? You think that bothers me?\"  - as you say there is a hesitancy about being the one to raise it.  But no-one has done so we're stuck not knowing.  \r\n\r\nHere in England we've had people saying \"Nitty-gritty\" referred to the bottom of slave ships (it never did), or \"Ship-shape and Bristol fashion\" was of slave sales when it has only ever meant \"Tidy, and secured against falling over\", there are stories of people mistaking the meaning of paediatrician and smashing someone's windows in, and someone who nearly lost his  job for using the word \"Pedagogue\".  In the North of England they had about 100 words for \"mean\", and one of them beginning with N has caused such misunderstanding it has it's own wikipedia page.   \r\n\r\nI'm in my 50s and I have seen it dawn on people that certain figures of speech either have a derogatory overtone, or just grate with some groups of people.  I tweeted about hearing this https://benjaminzephaniah.com/rhymin/white-comedy/  and so when Microsoft started changing from \"black-list\" to \"block list\" I felt that if anyone said \"It's just ...\" I could reply \"To you, sure, but here's someone who feels differently\".  I said on twitter that must have been 10 or 15 years ago and yet people are still getting round to changing that one. \r\n\r\nI make those two contrasting points because there are both \"invented harms\" where people demand action where none is needed and \"denied harms\", where action is needed but people refuse to take it.  If this use of master _is_ a problem then many others will need to go too but  of itself that's not a reason to block a change. Maybe some uses are OK in some countries and problematic in others (Some people think \"collaborate\" is a fine word, for others it still has overtones of working with Nazis in world war II) and a concern wanting to be international might need to do things something working in one country doesn't need to worry about. \r\n\r\nI saw that link where someone said \"Oh yes, Linus T probably used master in a system which has branches, because a different system where separate repos did the job of branches used master/slave for that relationship\".  It's a quite a leap, especially as slave has never been part of git (though some users have no-doubt used it), and the one person who seems to have said isn't definite about it.  Incidentally, have a look at the derivation of \"cargo cult\", that might also be one to avoid. ;-)\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://benjaminzephaniah.com/wp-content/themes/benjaminzephaniah/_/img/favicon.ico\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>Benjamin Zephaniah</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://benjaminzephaniah.com/rhymin/white-comedy/\">White Comedy - Benjamin Zephaniah</a></strong></div><div>I waz whitemailed\nBy a white witch,\nWid white magic\nAn white lies,\nBranded by a white sheep\nI slaved as a whitesmith\nNear a white spot\nWhere I suffered whitewater fever.\nWhitelisted as a whiteleg\nI waz in [...]</div></blockquote>",

      "body": "Not yours per se, this lunacy is beyond PowerShell repository and this \"feature request\". Not sure what is your motive, nor I want to act shrink here, but if anything, I consider it hostile as much as anything else that introduces clearly unneccessary and offtopic work on fine project such as this. \r\n\r\nBut let me bring _some_ of the facts many of which are beyond this repository:\r\n\r\n- Awfully lot of documentation uses _master_ as working example along with specific ones like contributing/develop/whatever.md. People do the same with gists/snippets\r\n- Awfully lot of automation has this branch hardcoded or set as default config value\r\n- One can argue that it is zero effort for new projects but people typically bring their existing scripts and whatnot into new projects\r\n- As noted already, MS is considering or already developing a tool for this, which cuts from available human and time resources\r\n- A lot of other people have now to devote time to this, on various levels, like us here, which could be infinitelly better spent elsewhere ( like improving your posh modules such as PSCache)\r\n- A lot of integrative and CI/CD tools assume master for various things (like build templates, just check out GitLab)\r\n\r\nObviously, \"some group\" which knows next to 0 about technology (and other things like human rights) thought this is great idea and asssumed little dwarfs will fix it magically over the night and everybody will be happy.  \r\n\r\nThis is not the first time such thing happens on Github either. This is also not the first time people who are interested in technology and not about everything else under universe voice their concern about such measures. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I am thinking hard about giving up comming here next time something like this creeps in, and just get back to private or more sane git community.
