  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nWith clean Windows 7 x86 SP1 VM.  Run Powershell 6.0.4 MSI from Releases (tried 6.1 too).\r\n\r\nGet prompt that it needs WMF 4.0 or higher.  (This is after an initial prompt to install the Universal C runtime which installs and is identified ok)\r\n\r\nInstall WMF 4.0 (KB2819745) x86 for Windows 7.. Same error.  Rebooted.  Same error.  Re-ran WMF 4.0 installer and that confirmed it was already installed.\r\n\r\nI subsequently installed WMF 5.1 which also required installing .NET Framework 4.5 and then PowerShell 6 installed.  But issue is with prompt and prerequisite saying to use 4.0.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```Installer to complete or prompt correct WMF version to use on Windows 7 x86 SP1.\r\n\r\n```http://aka.ms/pscore6-prereq also says use 4.0\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nInstaller fails to install or identify that WMF 4.0 was installed.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\npowershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\n```N/A\r\n",
