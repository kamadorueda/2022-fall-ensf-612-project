  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a PowerShell contributor,\r\nI want better configuration of Codacy for Pester test files\r\nSo that I don't get false negatives as part of the PR checklist.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nTests are often meant to push specific scenarios, which can lead to code that would fail a Codacy review, but since the tests are written that way intentionally the Codacy review is just generating false negatives when it raises issues with that code.\r\n\r\nI would like us to change how Codacy is used to instead do one of the following:\r\n\r\n1. Skip *.Tests.ps1 files because Pester tests often need to be written in a way that would break Codacy's style/practice guidelines.\r\n1. Move the review of *.Tests.ps1 into a separate Codacy test, and make it informational instead of blocking so that PRs still show a green checkmark even if the Pester tests are written in such a way that Codacy identifies problems with them.\r\n",
