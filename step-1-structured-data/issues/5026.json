  "body": "This PR attempts to allow the DotDot operator (..) to generate\r\ncharacter ranges, in turn allowing shorthand syntax like:\r\n\r\n    $AtoZ = -join('A'..'Z')\r\n\r\nSince PowerShell has no shorthand syntax for char literals, we\r\ntest whether the left-hand-side is of type String, and subsequently\r\nattempts to convert both operands to a char (in accordance with \r\nPowerShell operator overload behavior in general).\r\n\r\nNOTE: \r\n1) This breaks a number of currently supported range operations, such\r\nas implicit numerical conversion of strings:\r\n'1'..'100'\r\n\r\n2) This implementation is fairly naive, making no attempts to assert whether the input characters (or any codepoints in between) fall outside UCS-2 (ie. surrogates). Attempts to expand ranges bound by surrogate pairs are expected to fail and not covered by this implementation (I will leave this an exercise for someone more experienced with unicode hackery than myself)\r\n\r\nI was unable to locate existing tests for the integer range function, please advise on where to add those.",

      "body": "@IISResetMe did you only have the 2 commits? if so you could do this (assuming `PowerShell` is the name of your upstream remote for the actual PowerShell repo). Make sure you stash or commit any workspace changes before doing this as they will be lost. I'm not a git expert, and maybe there is a better way. So maybe wait until someone more seasoned either \"thumbs up\" this or tells you just how wrong I am :)\r\n\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit fetch\r\ngit checkout -b 20171015fix PowerShell/master\r\ngit cherry-pick 6e6dfffc2d0150b504585597ad4df997a174867a\r\ngit cherry-pick 6d6f20d28157ee49071f018051ac7b35be57bbb0\r\ngit checkout -b 20171015backup overload-DotDot-CharRange-1\r\ngit checkout overload-DotDot-CharRange-1\r\ngit reset --hard 20171015fix\r\ngit push --force\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will create a new `20171015fix` branch at the current master on this repo, then cherry-picks your 2 commits, then backs up your existing branch to `20171015backup`, and then hard reset your branch to the `20171015fix` branch. This will both \"rebase\" your branch on to master and add your commits with out the merge mess.  This will likely mess up any comment history here, but I guess it's already some what messed up.\r\n\r\n",
