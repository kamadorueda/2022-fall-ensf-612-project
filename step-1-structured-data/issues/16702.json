  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nAdd `Format` parameter to `Get-Clipboard` cmdlet. Like it done in Windows PowerShell. For example:\r\n```\r\n$img = Get-Clipboard -Format Image\r\n$img.Save(\"$PWD\\file.png\")\r\n```\r\nI am understanding that this can be done using .Net methods, but `Format` parameter make life better.\r\n`TextFormatData` makes too.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n```\r\nGet-Clipboard\r\n    -Format Text, FileDropList, Image, Audio                              Named\r\n    -TextFormatData Text, UnicodeText, Rtf, Html, CommaSeparatedValue     Named\r\n```",
