Bash allows temporary privileged mode by prefixing a command with sudo. In powershell, this entails spawning the whole shell under sudo which means that all commands run privileged which an anti-pattern for shell use in the UNIX world. Usage of sudo should be intercepted so that sudo starts a powershell process that runs the command/cmdlet then exits immediately instead of letting sudo start just a bash shell which would not support cmdlets.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```sudo Update-Help```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```The Update-Help cmdlet runs in admin privilege in a temporary powershell instance```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```The sudo command ends up spawning a privileged bash instance which obviously knows nothing about PWSH cmdlets```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value                                           \r\n----                           -----                                           \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-rc.2                                      \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                            \r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-rc.2                                     \r\nOS                             Linux 4.14.10-041410-generic #201712291810 SM...\r\nPlatform                       Unix                                            \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                         \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                             \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                         \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0 \r\n```\r\n",
