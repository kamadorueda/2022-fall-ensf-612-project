Here's some off the top of my head:\r\n\r\n1. Syntax is designed around accomidating interactive use\r\n   - Member expressions cannot have the `.` on a new line\r\n   - Curly brackets cannot be on a new line during command parsing\r\n1. Module autoloading. Can lead to loading clobbered (and possibly broken) commands. If depended on in a script it can also lead to issues with portability (different `PSModulePath`s/different installed modules) or simply make it more difficult to tell what modules a script depends on.  Yeah you can fully qualify and/or set `PSModuleAutoLoading` in a `try`/`finally` but both neither are great for readability.\r\n1. Aliases. I don't mean the typical \"people use aliases in scripts\".  I mean the fact that aliases exist and take priority over all over commands in look up really limits what \"private\" function names you can use.  For example, the `scoop` project uses a function named `shim` heavily, and I *had* an alias for `shim` which completely broke the project.\r\n1. The level of dynamicity. I'm not saying PowerShell would have been static if it didn't have an interactive component, but I don't think it would be as dynamic. There are lots of issues where state (variables, commands, imported modules, etc) is leaked into a script in unexpected and difficult to troubleshoot ways.\r\n\r\nI think in the answer in general is that a sizable portion of core design decisions were made with interactivity in mind.  Often with *some sort* of downside for scripting.  I think PowerShell is excellent in both interactive use and scripting, but scripting would have *definitely* been more robust without worrying about interactive use.",

They all have work arounds (though some of them should certainly have better work arounds) They're just examples of the scripting experience taking a hit for the good of the interactive experience. Whether or not they *should* be fixed is certainly debatable, but they are still *decisions* that were made at least partially to cater to interactivity.",

I don't agree that we should make scripts act all that differently by default.  I'd love to see some opt-in options for making a script or module a lot more strict, but having code that runs (more or less) the same in a script as it does interactively is incredibly valuable.  That keeps the learning curve *very* approachable and makes experimentation and prototypes a breeze. I'd love to see the opt-in settings for an easier way to get a more stable experience in large scale deployments/unknown environments, I do worry about the effect such a default would have outside of that scenario.\r\n\r\n> If you want robust dependency management, you need to be explicit about version number [ranges].\r\nFully agreed that the current method for specifying FQMN (fully-qualified module names) is unwieldy, but can we can take a page out of npm's book, with identifiers such as PSReadline@1.2 - and generally establishing semver (semantic versioning) in the PowerShell world sounds like a worthwhile goal as well.\r\n\r\nYeah for sure, but my point is that it shouldn't need to be declared on *every instance of every command invocation*.\r\n\r\nWe need a way to say I want command discovery to prioritize:\r\n\r\n* Module `x`\r\n* With version `y`\r\n* For this scope/module\r\n\r\nSo when you call `Get-Item` It doesn't import a version from `C:\\BadVendor\\MyHackyCommandOverrides.psd1` with no `Path` parameter.
