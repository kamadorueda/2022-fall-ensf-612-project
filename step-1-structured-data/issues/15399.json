      "body": "The cmdlet in Windows PowerShell uses Windows API functionality to do its thing. This fundamentally isn't cross-platform, so the cmdlet had to be rewritten. There wasn't really a way around it.\r\n\r\nIf there are specific features you feel are missing from the new version, it would be better to request those specifically, so that we can properly assess whether reintroducing any missing features is feasible with the cross-platform .NET API.",

      "body": "I see, that makes a lot of sense.  I have only been using ResponseTimeToLive (TTL ) and StatusCode from PS 5.  TTL would probably be the only one that would be helpful to me as that helps me determine if I am talking to a Windows machine or Linux machine.\r\n**I see that is available in .Reply.Options.Ttl so I guess I have everything I need!!**\r\n\r\nI try to code to both versions (non-core and core) so when the names are \"different\" it's just more code and a **surprise** when it doesn't work in the \"other\" version.\r\n\r\nI am all set as far as this is concerned.  Thank You for your RAPID response.  You can close this out.  :-)",
