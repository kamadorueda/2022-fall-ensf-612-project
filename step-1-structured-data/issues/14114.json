  "body": "So looking at the secrets management features, it looks nice, but on macOS, it's a bit...not there. (I know it is very early, and if this is on the list, apologies)\r\n\r\nThere's no option for Add-Secret\r\nGet-SecretVault doesn't seem to know anything about the keychain. This needs to be a default on macOS. Keep in mind, the keychain APIs allow for an arbitrary number of keychains, so if say, one wanted to create just a powershell keychain, that's absolutely possible (along with many other keychain functions): https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/keychain_services/keychains\r\n\r\nthis keeps the powershell team from having to write code for their own vaults, and if the user's main keychain is used, then the iCloud sync works as well. This would be a boon to a wide range of powershell users, especially sysadmins.\r\n\r\nEnabling the full range of commands for this on macOS is absolutely possible, and is something I've been looking forward to for quite a while (Since talking to Joey Aiello about it at ignite 2019 to be precise.)\r\n\r\n",
