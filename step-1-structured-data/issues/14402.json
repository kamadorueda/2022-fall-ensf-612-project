  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen a path (typically a _file-system_ path) is provided as input, it is helpful to know the _form_ of that path, with respect to whether:\r\n\r\n* it is relative (`./foo` or `foo`)\r\n* it is absolute (`c:\\foo` on Windows, `/foo` on Unix)\r\n* it is rooted (`\\foo`, `/foo`) - note: only on Unix-like platforms is a _rooted_ path also _absolute_\r\n* it is a UNC path (`\\\\server\\share\\foo`)\r\n\r\nTo that end we could introduce an enumeration-based `-PathForm` (aliased to `-Form`)  parameter that complements the existing `-PathType` (`-Type`) parameter (which examines the type of the item being referred to - container vs. leaf).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING\r\n\r\nPS> Test-Path foo -Form Relative   # ditto for ./foo\r\nTrue\r\n\r\nPS> Test-Path /foo -Form Rooted\r\nTrue\r\n\r\nPS> Test-Path C:\\foo -Form Absolute\r\nTrue\r\n\r\nPS> Test-Path \\\\server\\share\\foo -Form Unc\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this would obviate the need for `Split-Path`'s awkward `-IsAbsolute` switch - a switch that is poor fit for that cmdlet.\r\n\r\n",
