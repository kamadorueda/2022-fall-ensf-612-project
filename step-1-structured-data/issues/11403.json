To install, you must use the Add-AppxPackage cmdlet:\r\n> ```\r\n> Add-AppxPackage PowerShell-<version>-win-<os-arch>.msix\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nI think I remember that @SteveL-MSFT mentioned that this isn't something they're able to simply \"resolve\" for a downloaded MSIX, but will be a non-issue for releases that make it to the Windows Store proper.\r\n\r\nNote that as mentioned in #10469, you will need to have Developer Mode enabled on your system to allow the cmdlet to be used in this way.",
