  "body": "Although Raspbian supports .deb pkgs, the creation of a deb pkg needs to happen on an actual R-Pi device.  Next best thing for now is to produce a .tar.gz pkg making it easier to deploy PowerShell on R-Pi.\r\n\r\nNot sure if any other files need to be updated so we have a `preview` release of R-Pi support with 6.0.0-RC.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
