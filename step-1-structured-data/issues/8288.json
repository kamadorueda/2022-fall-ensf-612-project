  "body": "Currently there are several core cmdlets and no shortage of custom commands in public usage which declare parameters of type `[object]` (or `[psobject]`) and then after parameter binding decide whether or not input is usable, with varying success (as is practically always the case where multiple custom implementations may be present).\r\n\r\nWe are able to specify, currently, only a single possible parameter type. We _also_ have, for some convenience, the `[PSTypeName()]` attribute. However, given that PSObjects can be given completely arbitrary type names, this is at best a matter of convenience and ease of use where PSCustomObject usage is concerned. It cannot and does not attempt to validate that objects have the runtime type they may 'pretend' to have with an inserted PSTypeName.\r\n\r\nThis leads to unclear help documentation and parameter displays, and the user must either read the expanded help for such parameters specifically or the cmdlet as a whole, because the parameter diagrams are simply inaccurate. \r\n\r\nAs such, we have a bit of a gap here that we can fill. We could make use of a parameter attribute (suggested name: `ValidateTypeAttribute` aka `[ValidateType()]`) which would accept an _array_ of `Type` objects and/or _strings_ (provided those strings map to a resolvable runtime type; could be declared by the type's fullname or shortname/accelerator name if one is available).\r\n\r\nThis would provide necessary programmatic metadata for improvements to `Get-Help` whereby such parameters would in the syntax diagram explicitly be flagged as accepting (for example) _either_ `[string]`, _or_ `[hashtable]` or whatever else it might expect.\r\n\r\nI am willing to hash out the code for this, if it turns out to be something y'all like the concept of. \ud83d\ude04 ",

I'm not clear how this would function, in all honesty, I'm hazy about the possible use cases on that end... but if it's a possibility it'd definitely prove interesting to look at!",

      "body": "I worry this may promote bad design.\r\n\r\nFor commands that are out there that take an object or a `PSObject`, should those parameters be that generic?\r\n\r\nIn core PowerShell commands, many of those should be generic because they work against objects. A few other ones (e.g. `Get-Acl` and `Set-Acl` from WindowsPowerShell) accept a `PSObject` and then have some other criteria that they require (in the case of `Get-Acl` or `Set-Acl`, the presence of a `GetSecurityDescriptor` or `SetSecurityDescriptor` method is required).\r\n\r\nWhat might help here are specific examples demonstrating why PowerShell would benefit from a specific attribute for this, and why `ValidateScript` is not sufficient for those scenarios, or why a different design of the command syntax wouldn't be a better option.",

These properties are added as `NoteProperty` members to the output objects.\r\n    Wildcards are permitted.\r\n\r\n    The value of the Property parameter can be a new calculated property. To create a calculated, property, use a hash\r\n    table. Valid keys are:\r\n\r\n    - Name (or Label) <string>\r\n\r\n    - Expression <string> or <script block>\r\n\r\n    Required?                    false\r\n    Position?                    0\r\n    Default value                None\r\n    Accept pipeline input?

We could shortcut this quite a bit if we simply had a `[ValidateType([string], [hashtable])]`, and the help could look significantly cleaner, specifying clearly that only one of those two types are acceptable. The additional help text then need only specify the acceptable keys for hashtable input.\r\n\r\nThis cmdlet is not alone, but it _is_ the most commonly-used one that would benefit from this. If you pass in a completely bogus parameter value here, it should error at parameter binding time, I think.\r\n\r\nValidateScript isn't particularly suitable here since script blocks are not natively acceptable in C#. Certainly, you could use them for this, but it's significantly messier, and it would not translate to the help metadata whatsoever.",
