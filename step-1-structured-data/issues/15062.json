For example:\r\n```\r\nGet-Date -FromFiletime_Uts_ $filetime\r\n```\r\nThis would be logical to get the FileTime value and return the DateTime object from a single cmdlet. Without resorting to .net methods explicitly.  It's more a matter of style, not convenience. These are small things, but every little thing is important. I had never even thought of putting FileTime in Get-Date before. That's why I was surprised. Good Night, my _filetime_ is already near the morning.",
