  "body": "PowerShell Core version: v7.0.1\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\nRun the following lines in `pwsh -noprofile`:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference = \"None\"\r\n$ErrorView = \"ConciseView\"\r\nNonExistentCmdlet\r\n$ErrorView = \"NormalView\"\r\nNonExistentCmdlet\r\n$ErrorView = \"ConciseView\"\r\nNonExistentCmdlet\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n3 error messages are thrown, 1st and 3rd one formatted as concise error messages, 2nd one as normal error message.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nWhen `$ErrorView` is set to `\"ConciseView\"`, the errors are silently ignored and nothing is displayed. `\"NormalView\"` works correctly.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6414091/82053401-991cac80-96bd-11ea-8ac3-54492c9a8fb3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen running with `Set-PSDebug -Trace 2`, the following output is displayed:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6414091/81999799-89b64880-9656-11ea-9b8b-4a70e62c2c4d.png)\r\n\r\nThe output indicates that while printing output, the ConciseView error printing code uses `Test-Path`, which is not loaded because of the disabled auto-loading.\r\n\r\nThen, I attempted to first run `Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Management`, which contains the `Test-Path` cmdlet. After the import, with auto-loading still disabled, errors now correctly print in ConciseView.\r\n\r\n**This leads me to believe that the issue is in `Get-ConciseViewPositionMessage` function attempting to use `Test-Path`, which is unavailable due to disabled auto-loading.**\r\n\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nPowerShell Core:\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",
