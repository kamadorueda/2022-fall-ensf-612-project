  "body": "Moving toward broader usage on Windows for PowerShell Core 6, we will need to honour the `PSCompatibleEditions` field of module manifests.\r\n\r\nHowever, this field may be set conservatively or defaulted to a conservative value. As such we should allow a flag to allow the forced import of those modules for `Get-Module [-ListAvailable]` and `Import-Module`.\r\n\r\nIdeally the name of this flag should be pithy, expressive about being a compatibility override behaviour, and dangerous-sounding so that users will understand that things may break as a result.",

      "body": "`-Force` may actually work for this - though knowing _what_ is being forced would have to be gleaned from the documentation.\r\n\r\n* `Get-Module` currently doesn't have a `-Force` switch.\r\n\r\n* `Import-Module` does, and there it forces _reloading_ of the target module ([wonderfully summed up as \"Indicates that this cmdlet re-imports a module and its members, even if the module or its members have an access mode of read-only.\"  in the docs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2498)).\r\n   * However, I think it's fine to overload semantics of `-Force` situationally, given that you wouldn't ordinarily use `-Force` unless you expected the module to have been imported already.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
