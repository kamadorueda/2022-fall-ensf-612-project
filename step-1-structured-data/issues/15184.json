  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n`Get-Member` is currently strictly _type_-based: that is, it outputs information about the distinct _types_ among the input objects.\r\n\r\nIt therefore considers all `[pscustomobject]` instances to be the same type, even though instances can have vastly different properties, and only ever shows the _first_ instance's members among multiple input instances; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> [pscustomobject] @{ one = 1 }, [pscustomobject] @{ two = 2 } | Get-Member -Type Properties\r\n\r\n   TypeName: System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject\r\n\r\nName MemberType   Definition\r\n---- ----------   ----------\r\none  NoteProperty int one=1\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how only the _first_ instance's properties are being reported.\r\n\r\nInstead, `Get-Member` should recognize distinct `[pscustomobject]` \"types\" by differing _property names and/or types_.\r\n\r\n",
