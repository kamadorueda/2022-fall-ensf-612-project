If export succeed, why import struggles?\r\nShould Import-CliXml have a -Test switch to check the consistency of tags and nesting level?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Only `Export-CliXml` has `-Depth`, where it defaults to `2`, which, however, only applies to objects _other_ than nested collections, hash tables and `[pscustomobject]` instances; note that values greater than `2` can quickly get out of hand.\r\n\r\nPlease add a minimal reproducible case to your original post, because trying to reconstruct one from your description does _not_ reproduce the symptom:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Works fine in 5.1, 7.0.3, 7.1.0-preview.7\r\n[pscustomobject] @{\r\n    uri = [URI] 'http://example.org'\r\n    name = [string] 'hi'\r\n    datetime = [datetime]::now\r\n} | Export-Clixml test.clixml\r\n\r\nImport-Clixml test.clixml\r\n```",
