      "body": "@majkinetor \r\n\r\nRegarding your example: Note that you're referencing entries _across different_ hashtables, even though they're all _nested_ inside a single hashtable; e.g., `$env.docs.Server = $env.web.Server`\r\n\r\nThe beauty-half-full approach can handle this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n@{\r\n  web = ($web = @{ port = 80 })\r\n  docs = @{ port = $web.port }\r\n}\r\n```\r\nHowever, an automatic-variable-based solution cannot, as such a variable could only refer to the _immediately enclosing_ hashtable.\r\n\r\nGiven that @SeeminglyScience has demonstrated that the `$myHash = @{ foo=1; bar = $myHash.foo + 1 }` syntax would be a breaking change (and, as a moot aside, I wouldn't consider the renaming-the-variable-problem a minor one, I think it would become a source of many subtle bugs), that leaves us with the `[Hashtable(id)]` syntax or similar.\r\n\r\nA more concise form would be preferable, such as `@[id]{ ... }`; e.g.: \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n@[main]{\r\n  foo = 1\r\n  bar = $main.foo + 1\r\n  web = @[web]{ port = 80 }\r\n  docs = @{ port = $web.port }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, `@(id){...}` isn't an option because of the array-subexpression operator and neither is `@id{...}`, because in argument-parsing mode the `@id` part would be considered an instance of splatting; ditto for `@:id{...}`, surprisingly.\r\n\r\n_Some_ symbol that would currently result in a syntax error would be needed immediately after the `@`; another option is\r\n`@<id>{ ... }`, but it isn't great either.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@iRon7\r\n\r\nIf a (pseudo) variable were made available, the usual rules would apply, just as with the variable-based workaround.\r\nThis includes disambiguating between string and numeric keys: `$hash.1` gives you the `[string]` entry, `$hash[1]` the integer one.\r\n\r\nMy sense is that the primary use for this feature, especially in the context of configuration, would be in hashtables whose values are either .NET primitive types  or strings, where effectively getting _copies_ at declaration time works as intended (but the syntax won't prevent you from creating cyclic references, just like using regular variables won't; similarly, if your values are .NET reference types, multiple entries can end up pointing to the same instance).\r\n\r\nThe `System.Collections.Hashtable` / `System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary` types that PowerShell constructs from `@{ ... }` / `[ordered] @{ ... }` literals don't allow for references _between entries_ (I assume that's what you meant). It isn't the role of such syntactic sugar to add capabilities to the underlying types.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
