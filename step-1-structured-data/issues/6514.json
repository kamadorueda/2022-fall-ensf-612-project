  "body": "I have pwsh6 installed alongside Windows Powershell 5.1 that comes installed with Win10.\r\nI have a profile, profile.ps1, in my Documents\\WindowsPowerShell directory.\r\nThat profile isn't loading in pwsh6.\r\n\r\nThat led me to look at about_profile, to see if the profile names or some other behavior changed.\r\nAnd the text of that statement in pwsh6, unlike 5.1, is almost unreadable.\r\n\r\nThe, I think, applicable portion:\r\n```\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Description                  Path\r\n  ---------------------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  Current user, Current Host   $Home\\\\[My ]Documents\\\\WindowsPowerShell | | | \\\\Profile.ps1 | |Current User, All Hosts |$Home\\[My\r\n                               ]Documents\\Profile.ps1\r\n\r\n  All Users, Current Host      $PsHome\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 | |All Users, All Hosts |$PsHome.ps1\r\n  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't make heads or tails of that. There are double-backslashes where there don't need to be, there are two and three consecutive pipe symbols for unknown reasons, there are names that don't make any sense, e.g. \\\\Profile.ps1, $PsHome.ps1 ($PsHome is a directory, so $PsHome.ps1 is nonsense), there are what appear to be descriptions embedded in the middle of a line (| |Current User, All Hosts). I assume (hope) the formatting of that section is screwed up.\r\n\r\nThe end result is I can't tell if this is a real problem, because I can't tell from that documentation what the valid profile locations and names are. If they are the same as 5.1, then this would appear to be a real problem; the profile loads correctly in 5.1 and does not in 6.0.2.\r\n\r\nAlso, if I dot source the file in pwsh6, it loads without error. So the not loading doesn't appear to be because of a problem with the profile itself.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

Looks like the doc needs to be updated.  If you want the same profile loaded in both, you can create a symlink.  The markdown that you see will look a bit strange as backslashes need to be escaped, but the rendered HTML should read fine: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_profiles?view=powershell-6.\r\n\r\nCan you open an issue in the doc repo to get the documentation corrected?  https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues\r\n\r\n\r\n",
