      "body": "The hidden dot-files behaviour [was originally a bug in `ls`](https://linux-audit.com/linux-history-how-dot-files-became-hidden-files/), so I don't think it gets any credit there. What's more, the dot-file concept is specific to `ls` as a utility &mdash; things like `stat` don't care what a file is called.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, `Get-ChildItem` and `Get-Item` (which I think is arguably more like `stat` than `ls`) share a common implementation because they are *provider traversal commands* under which the filesystem provider is just one implementation, so the provider must have a single consistent behaviour underneath both of them. This isn't an implementation detail; PowerShell providers are a user-level concept and each `*-Item*` cmdlet corresponds to an established provider API.\r\n\r\nIncidentally this is actually much closer in spirit to Plan9's [`walk`](http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/5/walk) and reminds me of the fact that [Plan9 has no recursive `-r` flag on utilities](https://wiki.c2.com/?WhatIsNotInPlanNine) because their philosophy was that there should only be one code path for that.\r\n\r\nWith that said though, PowerShell providers do differentiate between getting an item and getting child items. `Get-Item` uses the former API:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a95b2cb17fecc8640533420b3baa9aec0f3749cb/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L1242-L1256\r\n\r\nWhile `Get-ChildItem` uses the latter:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a95b2cb17fecc8640533420b3baa9aec0f3749cb/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L1504-L1529\r\n\r\nSo conceivably we could alter the behaviour in only `Get-Item` without introducing deep inconsistency, here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a95b2cb17fecc8640533420b3baa9aec0f3749cb/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L1407-L1414\r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that PowerShell itself doesn't decide that files whose names start with `.` are hidden. We rely on an attribute that .NET gives us:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/a95b2cb17fecc8640533420b3baa9aec0f3749cb/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L1380\r\n\r\n[.NET has decided to inherit `ls`'s baggage here](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/4ed8a7ebd5dfdea079961e3698d2790fc48cc275/src/libraries/System.IO.FileSystem/src/System/IO/FileStatus.Unix.cs#L92-L94) and as a result, we have no way of knowing *why* a file was hidden. So this behaviour would need to apply to all hidden files (e.g. if a file has the BSD `hidden` flag set and starts with a `.`, we have no .NET-native way to know about the former). More importantly, this would imply changes on Windows as well, since again, we rely on .NET's abstraction here.\r\n\r\nThe main problem I see, clearly from the responses here, is that this is an established behaviour &mdash; users have learned that this happens with hidden files and that `-Force` is required much like with `ls -a`.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I don't have a particular horse in this race (I was mainly interested to learn more on the topic). But generally speaking, I'd say you need a pretty compelling argument to change an established behaviour in a core functionality like this.\r\n\r\n",

And it's appropriate for _enumeration_ behavior and for _wildcards that don't start with `.`_\r\n\r\nBut it's absurd otherwise - when you _know_ you're looking for a hidden file, either by literal path or by deliberately formulated wildcard - as evidenced by the following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Tab-complete a hidden file:\r\nPS> Get-Item ~/.ba<tab> # tab-completes to '/Users/jdoe/.bashrc'\r\nGet-Item: Could not find item /Users/jdoe/.bashrc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, you could argue that the tab-completion behavior should be fixed.\r\nBut I hope you won't.\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Thanks, @jantari, but just to spell it out: you workaround makes `Get-ChildItem` and `Get-Item` return hidden items _unconditionally_.\r\n\r\nA **proper fix** would mean:\r\n\r\n* Always allow items targeted by literal path, irrespective of their hidden status; never require `-Force` in that case.\r\n   * As an aside: requiring `-Force` for _removal_ is justified, and `Remove-Item` already behaves correctly in this case: if `-Force` is absent, instead of _pretending that the item doesn't exist_ (the way `Get-Item` always and `Get-ChildItem` _situationally_ does), it _acknowledges the existence_ and states that the hidden nature of the item requires `-Force`.\r\n* Omit hidden items _by default_ when _enumerating_ items in a directory, which happens in two cases:\r\n   * Explicitly, with `Get-ChildItem`\r\n   * Implicitly, via globbing (resolving _wildcard expressions_ to matching items)\r\n* To include hidden items in these enumeration cases, `-Force` is needed.\r\n  * Additionally, on Unix only, a wildcard expression (path component) that _starts with `.`_ should implicitly act as if `-Force` had also been passed (on Windows, an item's name doesn't signal its hidden status, so this doesn't apply)\r\n  * A related challenge - again on Unix only - is that the globbing applied when calling native utilities provides doesn't allow for a `-Force` switch (#4683).\r\n\r\nConversely, to summarize **what's broken** with respect to literal paths to hidden items specified without `-Force`:\r\n\r\n* `Get-Item` is broken with respect to both files and directories - it pretends they don't exist.\r\n \r\n* `Get-ChildItem` is broken with respect to _files only_ - it happily targets hidden _directories_ (see code below) and non-hidden files inside them (by direct path).\r\n\r\n  * It is in bad company there: `cmd.exe`'s `dir` exhibits the same partially broken behavior; additionally, `del` is broken in the sense that it _pretends that hidden items don't exist_ (cf. the sensible `Remove-Item` behavior described above).\r\n\r\nFurthermore, @rjmholt:\r\n\r\n> .NET has decided to inherit ls's baggage here\r\n\r\nTo recap: `.`-initial items being considered hidden from _enumeration_ is a decades-old convention observed on all Unix-like platforms.\r\n\r\n>  and as a result, we have no way of knowing _why_ a file was hidden.\r\n\r\nWe don't need to know, we can rely on .NET's enumeration behavior when exclusion of hidden items is requested (by default, nothing is excluded).\r\n\r\n> So this behaviour would need to apply to all hidden files (e.g. if a file has the BSD hidden flag set \r\n\r\nAt least as of .NET 5, the .NET file-system enumeration APIs don't know about this alternative, name-independent BSD/macOS mechanism of hiding files, and, similarly, neither does `ls` on macOS (where only the platform's file manager, Finder, observes it). [_Update_: This may change in .NET 6 - see https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/52235]\r\n\r\nAgain, deferring to .NET should be fine.\r\n \r\n---\r\n\r\nTo further illustrate the inconsistency in `Get-Item`'s (and partially `Get-ChildItem`'s) behavior with respect to literal paths directly targeting a hidden item: The following demonstrates that **other file-processing cmdlets _do_ find hidden items by literal path, by (often _invariable_) default**, and also juxtaposes the behavior with that of the platform-native shell / utilities:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Switch to a temporary directory.\r\nPush-Location -ea Stop ($tmpDir = (New-Item -Type Directory -Force (Join-Path Temp:/ $PID)).FullName)\r\n\r\ntry {\r\n\r\n  # Create a hidden directory... \r\n  $null = New-Item -Type Directory -ea Stop .hiddenTmpDir; if ($IsWindows) { attrib +h .hiddenTmpDir }\r\n  # ... and a hidden file.\r\n  $null = New-Item -Type File -ea Stop .hiddenTmpFile; if ($IsWindows) { attrib +h .hiddenTmpFile }\r\n\r\n  # Add content to the hidden file.\r\n  # Add-Content targets the hidden file just fine, if it is targeted with a literal path.\r\n  'hi1' | Add-Content -ea Stop .hiddenTmpFile\r\n  # Create a non-hidden file in the hidden directory.\r\n  # Note using the hidden directory as part of the file path works just fine.\r\n  'hi2' > .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt\r\n  # Ditto, with Set-Content\r\n  'hi3' | Set-Content -ea Stop .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt\r\n\r\n  # Get-ChildItem accepts literal paths to hidden directories and to files inside hidden directories,\r\n  # but NOT if you directly target a file that is itself hidden, .hiddenTmpFile.\r\n  (Get-ChildItem .hiddenTmpDir).Name\r\n  (Get-ChildItem .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt).Name\r\n\r\n  # Test the existence of the hidden file, the hidden dir. and the non-hidden\r\n  # file inside the hidden dir.\r\n  Test-Path .hiddenTmpFile\r\n  Test-Path .hiddenTmpDir\r\n  Test-Path .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt\r\n\r\n  # Get the content of the hidden file and of one of the non-hidden files in \r\n  # the hidden directory.\r\n  Get-Content .hiddenTmpFile\r\n  Get-Content .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt\r\n\r\n  # Set-Location / Push-Location accepts literal paths to hidden directories.\r\n  Push-Location\r\n  Set-Location .hiddenTmpDir\r\n  Pop-Location\r\n\r\n  # Removing a non-hidden file in a hidden dir. works as-is\r\n  Remove-Item .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt\r\n\r\n  # By contrast, removing an item that is itself hidden - justifiably - \r\n  # requires -Force, but note that Remove-Item does NOT pretend that the\r\n  # the item *isn't there* if you neglect to use -Force.\r\n  Remove-Item -Force .hiddenTmpFile\r\n  Remove-Item -Force -Recurse .hiddenTmpDir\r\n\r\n  '---- Native shell / external utilities:'\r\n\r\n  # Create a hidden directory... \r\n  $null = New-Item -Type Directory -ea Stop .hiddenTmpDir; if ($IsWindows) { attrib +h .hiddenTmpDir }\r\n  # ... and a hidden file.\r\n  $null = New-Item -Type File -ea Stop .hiddenTmpFile; if ($IsWindows) { attrib +h .hiddenTmpFile }\r\n  # ... and a non-hidden file in the hidden dir.\r\n  'hi3' > .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt\r\n\r\n  if ($isWindows) {\r\n    cmd /v /c 'cd .hiddenTmpDir & echo !CD!'\r\n    cmd /c 'dir /b .hiddenTmpDir'\r\n    cmd /c 'type .hiddenTmpFile'\r\n    cmd /c 'type .hiddenTmpDir\\test.txt'\r\n    cmd /c 'if exist .hiddenTmpFile echo exists'\r\n    cmd /c 'if exist .hiddenTmpDir echo exists'\r\n    cmd /c 'if exist .hiddenTmpDir\\test.txt echo exists'\r\n    cmd /c 'del .hiddenTmpDir\\test.txt'\r\n    cmd /c 'rd /q /s .hiddenTmpDir'\r\n  }\r\n  else {\r\n    sh -c 'cd .hiddenTmpDir; echo $PWD'\r\n    ls   .hiddenTmpFile\r\n    stat .hiddenTmpFile\r\n    ls -d .hiddenTmpDir\r\n    sh -c 'test -e .hiddenTmpFile && echo exists'\r\n    sh -c 'test -e .hiddenTmpDir && echo exists'\r\n    sh -c 'test -e .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt && echo exists'\r\n    cat .hiddenTmpFile\r\n    cat .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt\r\n    rm .hiddenTmpFile\r\n    rm .hiddenTmpDir/test.txt\r\n    rm -r .hiddenTmpDir\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\nfinally {\r\n  # Clean up.\r\n  Pop-Location; Remove-Item -Force -Recurse $tmpDir\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI think I've said all I have to say, so I'm unsubscribing from this thread.",
