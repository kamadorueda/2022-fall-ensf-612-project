  "body": "Resolves #682 \nThe issue happens to CoreCLR build but not FullCLR built because the `System.Management` namespace exists and is available in FullCLR (WMIv1 managed APIs), but it's not in CoreCLR. The fix makes sure we can expand a namespace even if partial name of the namespace doesn't really exist as a namespace or a type name.\n\nThis PR also include the most recent changes to ALC that were checked into RS2 branch. It has been reviewed by Mike and Andy when checking in to SD.\n\n@lzybkr can you please review the type completion fix?\ncc @vors for the change in CommonUtilities.cs\n",
