      "body": "New logs have more advanced API and the API was exposed to Get-WinEvent cmdlet. There is only a few common parameters. They are easy to remember or take from examples of help. Powerful queries can only be made using XML. So I do not see any benefit from adding new parameters. Perhaps we could improve IntelliSense.",
