  "body": "I've changed some of the Properties on PowerShell 7.0.0-preview.3, such as the font, and colouring of the window. When the application is launched via the shortcut then these preferences are retained for each launch.\r\n\r\nIf, however, I launched the application by right clicking in File Explorer and selecting `Powershell 7-preview > Open here` the preferences from the other window aren't loaded. Interestingly, however, if I change the properties in that window, and then use the dialogue options again, then the settings (of the window i just changed) are loaded. The preferences of the shortcut to the aopplication aren't affected.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the settings are saved in different locations depending on if the application is launched from a shortcut to `C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7-preview\\pwsh` (or running the executable from the directory), or using the Windows Explorer Dialogue.",

Does seem to be a Windows \"feature\". \ud83d\ude1e\r\n\r\nWill close this then. Thanks.\r\n",
