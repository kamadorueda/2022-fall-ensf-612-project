  "body": "Involved modules/technologies:\r\n* Az\r\n* docker\r\n\r\n**Scope**\r\n\r\nWhen using powershell inside docker, and using azure, then you might want to preserve the azure authentication. So next time the docker container you will use, will still have the azure credentials, and we don't need to provide them again. This is helpful when spawning multiple docker instances with multiple commands, one after the other.\r\n\r\n**docker command example**\r\n```\r\ndocker run -ti --rm \\\r\n\t  -e USER=$USER \\\r\n\t  -e HOSTNAME=$HOSTNAME \\\r\n\t  -e SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/ssh-agent \\\r\n\t  -v $(SOURCE_PATH)/build/.Azure:/home/user/.Azure \\\r\n\t  -v $(SOURCE_PATH)/build/.Azure-IdentityService:/home/user/.local/share/.IdentityService \\\r\n\t  -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa:/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa \\\r\n\t  -v ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub:/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub \\\r\n\t  powershell-image-name:TAG <cmd>\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe mounted the ~/.Azure directory in the past, but somehow/somewhere the .IdentityService directory seemed to be added as a needed directory to keep the credentials working.\r\n\r\nI noticed by executing:\r\n```\r\nPS> Get-AzContextAutosaveSetting\r\nMode             : CurrentUser\r\nContextDirectory : /home/user/.Azure\r\nContextFile      : AzureRmContext.json\r\nCacheDirectory   : /home/user/.IdentityService\r\nCacheFile        : msal.cache\r\nSettings         : {}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat `/home/user/.IdentityService` didn't existed, but when searching though all changed files, I found it at the location:\r\n```\r\n/home/user/.local/share/.IdentityService\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich seems it isn't respecting the AzContextAutosaveSetting.",
