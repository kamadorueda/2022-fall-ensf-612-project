  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOpen a powershell terminal in Linux. You can use any gnome-terminal or terminator, doesn't seem to matter what Terminal program you are using.\r\n\r\nRun a program that runs a Jetty service in the background. Example: Lucidworks Fusion 4.2.6\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n/home/ndipiazza/.fusion/4.2.6/bin/fusion start\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow close the terminal.\r\n\r\nNotice the Java binaries that were opened will killed when the powershell terminal dies. \r\n\r\nRepeating these same steps using a normal terminal will not have this problem. It is only when you start the program from a powershell terminal that this happens.\r\n\r\nvideo capture here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MniUDVmiJGo&feature=youtu.be\r\n\r\nThis also does not happen on Windows.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nShould keep running after terminal is closed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nForked java processes die along with powershell. Seem to also die intermittently when you use \"CTRL+C\".\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Linux 5.4.0-48-generic #52-Ubuntu SMP Thu Sep 10 10:58:49 UTC 2020\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

I bet that one of these \"process destroyers\" are somehow confused by the combination of Linux + PowerShell and causing the processes to be destroyed when powershell terminal it originated from is destroyed. \r\n\r\nI will do some more digging and close this issue if it turns out this \"process destroyer\" is doing this. \n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/1213260?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/zeroturnaround/zt-exec\">zeroturnaround/zt-exec</a></strong></div><div>ZeroTurnaround Process Executor.
