I tried to make that clear in the comments, but I suspect it will still catch users by surprise.  Assuming this is intentional and none of the properties will be deprecated, would **bold** be appropriate to draw attention to this difference?",

      "body": "Also, since `BasicHtmlWebResponseObject` doesn't override `.ToString()`, it will differ from `.Content` and `.RawContent` since it contains the response content decoded as ASCII with non-printable characters removed.  Although it meets the definition of a \"string representation\", which is all that it is documented to return, I worry it may also catch users by surprise if they write code which uses `ToString()`.",
