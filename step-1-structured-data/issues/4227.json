  "body": "There are two fixes in psl-pester which we should have:\r\n\r\n- Add Context information to the pester log which will reduce the name collisions with test names. This will improve the unique-ness of test names, which will enable us to be able to compare test runs across platforms.\r\n- Update test teardown so exceptions thrown in AfterAll will not leave pester in a bad state.\r\nWhen this happens, Pester fails all subsequent tests with the error 'Already in Describe'.\r\n\r\n",
