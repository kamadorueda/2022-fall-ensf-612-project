  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nIssue copied from https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/8505\r\n\r\nDue to the addition of `ResolvedTarget` in issue https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13366 and PR https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/16490, and the lack of any mention of PowerShell on the C# page for [`FileInfo`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.IO.FileInfo?view=net-6.0) and [`DirectoryInfo`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.IO.DirectoryInfo?view=net-6.0), it may make sense to create a separate page for these objects in the PowerShell documentation, so they may have the aforementioned `ResolvedTarget` property, which doesn't exist outside of PowerShell.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n.NET API documentation must be updated in the PowerShell source code.",
