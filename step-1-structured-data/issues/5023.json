  "body": "> **Note:** When installing the SDK, SUSE and OpenSUSE may report that nothing provides libcurl. libcurl should already be installed on supported versions of both distros. Run zypper search libcurl to confirm. The error will present 2 'solutions'. Choose 'Solution 2' to continue installing .NET Core.\r\n\r\nA manual step is required for install powershell on openSUSE (same as `dotnet-sdk-2.0.0`), so the current scripts that automatically set up powershell on OpenSUSE don't work.\r\nTwo scripts are affected:\r\n- tools/download.sh\r\n   It will continue to install the beta.6 powershell openSUSE package.\r\n- tools/installpsh-suse.sh\r\n   It's already broken since beta.7, because we stopped publishing suse.42.1 package in beta.7 because openSUSE 42.1 has reached the end of the lifecycle.\r\n\r\nSo we need to update those two scripts or remove them.\r\n",
