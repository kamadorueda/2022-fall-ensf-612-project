  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nAdd launchSettings.json for better out of box experience when using Visual Studio and up minimum Visual Studio version to 16 as .Net Core 3 requires this as a minimum. Launching from the `bin` (instead of publish folder) does not work any more, hence the configuration.\r\nNow one can just use `Ctrl+F5` to launch `pwsh.exe` from Visual Studio and one can then attach after that. The VS console has some known limitations (Unicode characters are not displayed for example) and at startup there are some binding exceptions that are thrown, therefore I would not recommend doing a straight `F5` at the moment but I hope this will get better with .Net Core and VS becoming more mature (at the moment one HAS to use the preview of Visual Studio for .Net Core 3)\r\n\r\nFixes #9810\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",

I tried doing it in WSL but it seems that `Start-DevPowerShell` does not work in WSL any more. We should raise an issue for this. Can someone else confirm that this issue does not affect non-Windows users please? I have published the PR in the meantime.",
