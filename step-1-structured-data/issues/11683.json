      "body": "I agree with @jhoneill that the behaviour here is consistent - no colour changes occur with any tab expansion. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I agree it might be nice to see Pink in PInk. How about a -GetColoursample parameter to Get-HBost, that displays the colours that match the parameter value IN their colour?\r\n\r\nAnd a command or parameter that shows the Ascii escape character values would be nice too.",
