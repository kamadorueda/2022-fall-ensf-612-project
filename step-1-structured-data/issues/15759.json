      "body": "@thukk \r\n\r\nI looked at this today and the main problem (as I mentioned before) is that SSH error data is unreliable, as it streams banner text, warnings, non-terminating errors, and terminating errors.  The SSH transport currently assumes any error should terminate the connection.  The reason for this was to prevent a hanging connection attempt, a connection that cannot succeed but continues indefinitely.  But this results in sessions being prematurely terminated due to warnings, or other non-terminating messages coming through stdError, even when we try to filter out known non-terminating error messages (warnings).\r\n\r\nHowever, it turns out that SSH will fail to connect and not emit any message whatsoever, under some conditions, so we still have the hanging problem even if we treat all error messages as terminating.  To solve this problem I added a `-ConnectingTimeout` so that users can optionally end a connection attempt after a period time.\r\n\r\nI am now thinking that we can fix this problem (and other issues) by just removing the connection terminating on error message code.  Any SSH error messages will be streamed to the terminal, but the connection attempt will never be aborted based on SSH error messages.  So there will be only two (already existing) ways to stop a connection attempt:\r\n\r\n- Typing `Crtl+C` into interactive terminal\r\n- Using `-ConnectingTimeout` that will automatically terminate an unsuccessful connection attempt.\r\n\r\nThis will be a breaking change, but I feel it is minor.  But I'll mark this for committee review.",
