      "body": "@dantraMSFT I think the purpose is to enable the style checking about empty string (favor `string.Emtpy` over `\"\"`). That rule cannot be turned on today due to too much noise.\r\nThe intern string should not be a concern, now it's one instance per assembly, but after replacing with `string.Empty` it will be one instance per process.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov Thanks for spending efforts on driving the style consistency. I ran [`check-stringreplacementchange-ps1`](https://gist.github.com/daxian-dbw/3df8f9236a73a1d9b8c5cc913476d618#file-check-stringreplacementchange-ps1) with this PR and the results look good except for the three comments I left.\r\n```\r\n$log = .\\Check-StringReplacementChange.ps1 -PRUrl https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6950 -OriginalText '@\"\"','\"\"' -NewText 'string.Empty' -PassThru\r\n```\r\n\r\nI quickly go through the changes and didn't notice any replacements in PowerShell scripts in `.cs` files, that's good because `string.Emtpy` will definitely fail in powershell script. However, since I went through so quickly, I could miss something, so please double check that you are not replacing anything in powershell script (script strings). After double checking that, the PR should be good.",
