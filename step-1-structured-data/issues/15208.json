  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nPassing a `[byte[]]` array to `Set-Content` / `Add-Content -AsByteStream` should result in efficiently writing the given bytes.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this is excessively slow, because _each byte is converted to `[object]`_ on parameter binding, as @powercode has discovered in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/15188#issuecomment-816581316.\r\n\r\nIn effect, PowerShell currently lacks an efficient way to write a byte array to a file, making direct use of .NET APIs necessary.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the problem:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# !! This is excessively slow.\r\nSet-Content tmp.bin -AsByteStream -Value ([byte[]]::new(32mb))\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above takes about 30 seconds(!) on my machine, even though only 32 MB is written.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the equivalent .NET solution completes almost instantaneously:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[IO.File]::WriteAllBytes(\"$pwd/tmp.bin\", [byte[]]::new(32mb))\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nChange the type of the `-Value`  parameter from `object[]` to `object`, and perform cmdlet-_internal_ detection of `byte[]` input.\r\n\r\nAs @powercode notes, we need to ensure that this causes no backward-compatibility issues.",
