  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have a program on my system called `stopwatch.exe`, so sometimes I will have PowerShell open, and I will enter the command. However I also use tab completion, so I will usually enter:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nstopw TAB\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nthen press enter. However if on accident I enter:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nstop TAB\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nThen I instead get Stop-Computer, which shuts down the computer. I have done this on accident now at least twice, and its very annoying.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes anyone has a solution for this problem? I know with the old `shutdown.exe`, you could enter `shutdown /a` to cancel it, but I dont know if anything like that is available with PowerShell.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/stop-computer\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "Instead of editing the file to remove Stop-Computer you can override it with a function or Alias that either does nothing, or executes stopwatch.exe. Functions and aliases have a higher precedence so if you create a dummy function like this: `function Stop-Computer {}` it should get executed instead of the Stop-Computer cmdlet.  \r\nYou would define this function inside your $profile file so it works in every session.",
