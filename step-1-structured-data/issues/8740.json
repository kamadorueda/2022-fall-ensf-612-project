      "body": "Note that this came up as importing Az module with -Verbose shows a \"Exporting function Test-DotNet\" message.  However, after debugging this, it appears that for a function to be visible in the current session, it is \"exported\" and then \"imported\".  So you would see both verbose messages.  This seems by-design, but certainly a bit confusing.  Perhaps we could change the \"Exporting function ...\" message to something else to make it more obvious.  However, since I haven't seen lots of mention about this, putting it up-for-grabs on a suggestion.",

      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT This is by design. A command is exported from the `.psm1` module and then imported into the `.psd1` module which may, in turn, export it into the caller's session state. A `.psd1` file is essentially a \"view\" into the set of modules it aggregates. You get the two verbose messages so if something isn't exported, you can tell at what level the problem exists i.e. wasn't exported at the `.psm1` level or it wasn't exported at the `.psd1` level making, it easier to debug.",

      "body": "@BrucePay @SteveL-MSFT perhaps the data can be useful, but what's actually happening needs to be clarified in the messages, as for anyone who doesn't know exactly how module leading works, that's extremely unclear. :smile:\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first messages could say something more like \"Discovered function X in X.psm1\"\r\n\r\nAnd the second more along the lines of \"Discovered function/alias X in X.psd1, matched to X in X.psm1; exporting function to session.\"\r\n\r\nJust something that gives enough clarity on where the importing routines are in the process. Ideally, I think verbose or debug messages should provide useful data that someone receiving can either act upon or have a good idea of who to call upon to look at it.",

Without understanding the internals, the current messages can be confusing to the user.  Having indentation would help with the nesting of the modules.  Recommendation is to change:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExporting function `test`\r\n```\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\n```\r\nExporting function `test` from noexport.psm1\r\nNot exporting function `test` from noexport.psm1 via noexport.psd1\r\n```\r\n",
