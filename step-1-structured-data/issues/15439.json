But PowerShell was installed are worked well in previous builds. 1st I thought that the application that already saved might be corrupted, so I again downloaded PowerShell, and trying to install, also I performed \"troubleshoot compatibility\" but problem is still present.\r\n![Screenshot (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39850181/119233594-7bdbb300-bb47-11eb-80b8-3fdd63e0de66.png)\r\n![Screenshot (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39850181/119233601-8302c100-bb47-11eb-95da-ac307f35819e.png)\r\n\r\n",

Permission related issue in Windows \"Temp\" folder, here is a fix that I want to share:\r\n\r\n1. Go to directory \"C:\\Windows\" and right click on \"Temp\" folder and select \"Properties\".\r\n2. In \"Security\" tab, select \"Advanced\" then select \"Add\" (if \"Change Permission\" option showing, then select this and then select \"Add\").\r\n3. Now select \"select a principal\", type any word or name and select \"check names\" and click OK.\r\n4. In \"Basic Permissions\" , tick/check \"Full Control\" and select \"OK\".\r\n5. Repeat the same process with built-in \"Administrators\" permission which is already showing in permission entry.\r\n6. Now select \"Apply > OK\" , if any warning message showing related from security, then accept this setting.\r\n7. Now in \"Security\" tab, select \"Edit\" option, select the permission you created in step 3 and check \"Full Control\" and click \"Apply\".\r\n8. Now select \"Administrators\" permission, check \"Full Control\" and click \"Apply > OK\".\r\n\r\nThis step does not affact security, but a fix of error 2502 and 2503.",
