On the projects I work on, they use `username/topic-name` for private user branches (bug fixes, feature impls) and `feature-name` for shared feature branches.  This makes it easy to identify a dev's private branch from shared feature branches.  The `/` character also results in a nice, tree-view display in Visual Studio's Branches tool window. :-)\n",
