  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nInstall Powershell Core (latest build) on a machine whose UI Culture is set to something other than en-US... In my case it's en-GB.\r\n\r\nRun Update-Help from an administrator command prompt. Then try getting help on a basic command like `help Update-Help -full`. It will tell you that the help files aren't installed.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nHelp files should be installed.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nHelp files don't get installed.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have worked around this by doing Update-Help -UICulture en-US, but I shouldn't have to do this. This command worked fine in Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nOne of the most amazing things about PowerShell is the rich help system. But if it doesn't work for a huge amount of users (anyone not in the US) then what's the point?\r\n\r\nSee this related issue: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5534",

      "body": "Eventually, we want to localize help, so this should not be as big an issue in the future (still need to work out how to do the localization...).  Also, it seems that this worked in Windows PowerShell, because what happens is if you don't use the `-UICulture` parameter, it automatically uses `[CultureInfo]::CurrentUICulture`.  On .NET Framework, the parent of `en-GB` is `en`, but the parent of `en` is `en-US` so it falls back to installing the `en-US` documentation.  On .NET Core, the parent of `en-GB` is `en` and the parent of that is `Invariant Language` so it fails.  We should continue to rely on .NET to do the right thing in regards to fallback, so we shouldn't special case `en-US` here.  For now, I think the updated error message is sufficient.\r\n\r\nCreated https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/955\r\n\r\nWe can explore if it's acceptable to default to `en-US` if there's nothing else and have a switch the user can use to explicit not fallback to `en-US`.",
