  "body": "When you use try/catch and handle an exception, it still shows up in the global `$Error`, and _more importantly_, in the ErrorVariable.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to actually prevent handled exceptions from leaking into the ErrorVariable? Is there any way for a caller to determine that they are **not,** in fact, errors, but expected results that were dealt with by the function?  That is, how does a caller distinguish the errors that matter?\r\n\r\nConsider a simple example:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\nfunction Count-Parameters {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param([Parameter(ValueFromRemainingArguments)]$Parameters)\r\n    try {\r\n        $Parameters.FasterMethod()\r\n    } catch {\r\n        $Parameters.Count\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n$Count = Count-Parameters # Everything is fine\r\n\r\n$Count = Count-Parameters This One Has Four # Still fine\r\n\r\n# But then my paranoid \"best practice\" fanatic does something like this:\r\n$Count = Count-Parameters -ErrorVariable noCount\r\nif(!$Count -and $NoCount) { \r\n   Write-Warning $noCount\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow can I stop the error variable from containing these things that I explicitly handled?",

For example, if you invoke PowerShell using the ```System.Management.Automation.PowerShell``` class, and if you handle the errors in the command you invoke by indicating that they should be ignored, ```S.M.A.PowerShell``` will still set HadErrors to true. Here is a code sample illustrating the problem:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$ps = [PowerShell]::Create()\r\n$ps.AddCommand('Get-Service').AddParameter('Name','Invalid').AddParameter('ErrorAction',[System.Management.Automation.ActionPreference]::Ignore) > $null\r\n$ps.Invoke()\r\n$ps.HadErrors # returns $true; expectation is that this would return false since the command was configured to ignore errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can see the same behaviour via direct command invocation in PowerShell:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nGet-Service -Name Invalid -ErrorAction Ignore\r\n$? # returns $false; shouldn't this return $true?\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both of these cases, ```-ErrorAction Ignore``` is being used to tell PowerShell that the error can be completely ignored. Why then, do both ```$?``` and ```$ps.HadErrors``` indicate the error? Technically there was an error, but it is being handled/treated like it is not an error, so I believe in both of these cases ```$?``` and ```$ps.HadErrors``` should have values indicating that there wasn't an error.

If someone really wants to know if an error occurred when -ErrorAction Ignore is used, they should write their own script that doesn't use -ErrorAction Ignore. Give me a real world use case where someone would want to know if a benign error occurred in a command or script they invoked. You shouldn't care about that when you invoke a command, because at the moment you are invoking that command you are placing your trust that the author of that command will properly let you know if there was an error that you should care about. If you don't trust that, then you shouldn't be invoking that specific command.\r\n\r\nThe whole point of -ErrorAction Ignore is to suppress errors. Suppression is of little use for scripts invoked via S.M.A.PowerShell if the invoker has to ignore .HadErrors and check the Errors collection every time (which will be empty).

      "body": "@Jaykul: While I'm still unclear on what you were asking, perhaps I can clarify on my end:\r\n\r\nRe logging in `$Error` / `-ErrorVariable`:\r\n\r\nMy concern fits into the larger issue of the existing, longstanding dichotomy with respect to how non-terminating vs. terminating errors must be handled  - see  [Our Error Handling, Ourselves - time to fully understand and properly document PowerShell's error handling](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/1583).\r\n\r\nAs @BrucePay has pointed out, `-ErrorAction Ignore` already is a departure from the unconditionally-log-all-exceptions-in-`$Error` behavior, but is currently only available for _non-terminating errors_ (e.g., `Get-Item /NoSuchPath -ErrorAction -Ignore`). \r\n\r\nAs stated,  `-ErrorAction Ignore` has no effect on a (statement)-_terminating_ error such as `Get-Item -NoSuchParam -ErrorAction Ignore` (a distinction that strikes me as problematic, especially that using the `$ErrorActionPreference` _preference variable does_ apply to terminating errors, but it's probably way too late to change that).\r\n\r\nHere's what `-ErrorAction Ignore` combined with `-ErrorVariable` currently does:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $Error.Clear(); Get-Item /NoSuchPath -ErrorAction Ignore -ErrorVariable ev; $Error.Count; \"[$ev]\"\r\n0  # nothing was written to $Error\r\n[] # nothing was captured in $ev\r\n```\r\n\r\nYour proposal at least _in part_ asks for the _analogous_ behavior with respect to handling _terminating_ errors, which must be done with `Try`/ `Catch`.\r\n\r\nIt is the _in part_ aspect that I find problematic:\r\n\r\nFor symmetry, conceiving of `Try`/ `Catch` as the `-ErrorAction Ignore` counterpart - or, more accurately, a _superset_ of it - makes sense to me.\r\n\r\nIf we _only_ suppress filling the `-ErrorVariable` variable while continuing to log to `$Error`, we don't have that symmetry:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $Error.Clear(); Invoke-Command { try {1 / 0} catch{} } -ErrorVariable ev; $Error.Count; \"[$ev]\"\r\n1  # $Error was still written to, unlike with -ErrorAction Ignore\r\n[] # in the future: $ev was not assigned to\r\n```\r\n \r\nHence my suggestion to not only suppress assigning to the `-ErrorVariable` variable, but to also suppress logging to `$Error`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nRe `$?` / `.HadErrors`:\r\n\r\n@KirkMunro  then took a step back to bring up a conceptually related issue, arguing that `-ErrorAction Ignore` - again: applicable to _non-terminating_ errors only - should indicate _success_, given the explicitly signaled intent to _ignore_ errors - similar to how `Try` / `Catch` can be conceived of.\r\n\r\nMy aside re `try { 1 / 0 } catch {}; $?` was meant to show that in the terminating-error realm checking `$?` after `try` / `catch` is virtually pointless, because what `$?` is set to depends on whether the `catch` block happens to be empty (`$False`) or not (whatever statement happens to execute last in the `catch` block determines the value of `$?`).\r\n\r\nTaking another step back: `$?` is problematic in other contexts too:\r\n\r\n* [Automatic $? variable is reset to $True when a command is enclosed in parentheses - make $? only reflect command status, not expression status](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3359)\r\n\r\n* [Write-Error in a function doesn't set $? to $False (doesn't set the execution status to indicate a non-terminating error) in the caller's scope](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3629)\r\n\r\n",
