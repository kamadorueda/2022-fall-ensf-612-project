  "body": "Note: I don't know whether what I'm proposing is _technically_ feasible.\r\n\r\nIt would improve the usability of `--%`, the stop-parsing symbol, if it could be placed _before_ the executable name. Currently, you have to translate executable paths based on `%...%` into PowerShell first.\r\n\r\nA real-world use case from this [SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/42601270/45375):\r\n\r\n    \"%winscp%\" ...\r\n\r\nTo use such a `cmd.exe` command line (mostly) as-is with `--%`, this currently has to be translated into:\r\n\r\n    & $env:winscp --% ...\r\n\r\nSuch a translation may be too steep a hurdle for beginners, who are the primary demographic for the `--%` feature.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if one could instead do:\r\n\r\n     & --% \"%winscp%\" ...\r\n\r\nor perhaps even let `--%` take the syntactic place of `&`:\r\n\r\n    --% \"%winscp%\" ...\r\n\r\n",
