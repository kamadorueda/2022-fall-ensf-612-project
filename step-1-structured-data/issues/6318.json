Building a `v6.1.0` and a `v6.1.0-preview` package\r\n1. Verified that the versions showed up in the packages as `6.1.0` and `6.1.0~preview`\r\n1. publishing them to an Aptly repo\r\n1. connecting a client and verifying that `v6.1.0` is the offered package and `v6.1.0-preview` is available.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I've done similar verification for CentOS\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
