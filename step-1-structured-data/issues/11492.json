      "body": "The `-Source` parameter shouldn't be silently ignored, because then the user would believe the connection was tested from the source IP but it's actually not, and that's confusing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the current error message is thrown from the parameter binder, because `-Source` parameter is made a getter (not settable). The current error is not helpful to the user to understand what's going on. Instead, the error should be thrown from `Test-Connection` with a better message, to help the user understand such a limitation exists today.",
