See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/16700#issuecomment-1117601312 for details.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nThe wrapped words should keep the same color decoration.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe wrapped words lost their color decoration.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.3.0-preview.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.3.0-preview.3-68-gd1824b287b40c8a664b90d5c724e69c749d2cef2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
