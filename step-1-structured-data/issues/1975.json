      "body": "On Windows, it's common to use an extension, e.g. `gsn.exe`, but obviously that won't help on Linux.\n\nA full path (or relative path) is the most obvious way to invoke an external command, but we do have a syntax (admittedly obscure) if you don't know the path:\n\n``` powershell\n& (Get-Command -CommandType Application gsn)\n```\n\nThe `&` operator is the invocation operator - which is more often used to invoke commands with spaces in the path or to execute a command whose name is in a variable. In my example above, because of strong typing, the invocation operator recognizes the output of Get-Command (an instance of something deriving from `System.Management.Automation.CommandInfo`) and correctly calls that command, allowing you to override the default command resolution algorithm.\n\nThat said, I agree a better syntax is needed for Linux.\n",

Per POSIX, any valid file name character can be used in a command name (where the legal filename characters varying between file systems). \nWith respect to `@gsn`, you can always use quoting to disambiguate e,g, `Get-ChildItem \"@gsn\"`.  \nWe do have an existing notation --% which tells parser to stop quote and expansion processing - we might be able to tweak that though it would be technically breaking but probably wouldn't really break anything, One other possibility is to simply keep using the .exe suffix syntax and give it the semantic that it looks for a native command without the suffix on *NIX systems e.g. 'gsn.exe' is mapped to \"gsn\" \n",
