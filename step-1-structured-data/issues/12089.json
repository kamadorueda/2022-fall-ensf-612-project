      "body": "We're you getting this in 6.2? The screenshot you're showing looks like it came from Windows PowerShell (which would be v5.1).\r\n\r\nThe parsing used to find such elements in the page in 5.1 is not usable in .NET Core or PS v6+ as it relies entirely on communication with an Internet Explorer session on the back end. PowerShell was not doing that parsing. \r\n\r\nThis could be considered as a feature request for the existing behaviour, but it's probably safe to say that specific way of handling in will not be used again. It's simply not feasible on anything other than Windows, and as IE grows older the chances it keeps working gradually get smaller anyway.",
