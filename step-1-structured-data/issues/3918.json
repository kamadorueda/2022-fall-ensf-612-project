  "body": "Related #3400\r\n\r\nMotivation\r\n---\r\nResGen tool process all resx files in PowerShell Repo at a time. It is not problem because it works very fast. But updating multiple cs files causes all Repo projects to be recompiled. It really slows down.\r\n\r\nWe still can not use native resgen from dotnet-cli. See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2882#issuecomment-304300044\r\nSo we should enhance our ResGen tool, use MSBuild capabilities and process resx files one at a time to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.\r\n\r\nFix\r\n---\r\nWe can specify a resx file path parameter on the command line and process resx files one at a time.\r\n\r\nFollow-Up work\r\n---\r\nWe will clean up Build.psm1 and modify csproj files to use the new feature of ResGen tool with MSBuild for faster project build.\r\n",

We should just figure out the way to switch to msbuild resgen sooner or later.\r\nLet's just expose this functionality thru `Start-ResGen` optional parameter in the same PR.",
