However on Powershell Core on Windows it is similar to Windows back button. This is confusing for Linux users.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\n1- currently in dir1\r\n1- `cd -` # go to previous directory dir2\r\n3- `cd -` # go to previous directory dir1\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n1- currently in dir1\r\n1- `cd -` # go to previous directory dir2\r\n3- `cd -` # go to the directory previous to dir2, dir3\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
