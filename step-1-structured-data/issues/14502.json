I was installing Git for PowerShell (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Appendix-A%3A-Git-in-Other-Environments-Git-in-PowerShell), and when I put `Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser -AllowPrerelease -Force` in the console, it log me that the paramater `AllowPrerelease ` doesn't exist. My PowerShell version is:  _5.1.18362.1171_ and I have the Desktop version. Can someone help me, please?\r\n",
