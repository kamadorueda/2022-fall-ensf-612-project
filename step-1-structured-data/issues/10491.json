      "body": "You're implicitly creating a _function-local_ `$t` variable inside your `test` function, which goes out of scope when the function is exited - the _script-level_ `$t` is never modified.\r\n\r\nIn an  _assignment_, you'd have to refer to the script-level `$t` variable as `$script:t`, for instance.\r\n\r\n(However, on _retrieval_ of the script-level `$t` value, `$t` is sufficient (unless you're shadowing it with a local `$t`). This asymmetry is a common pitfall - see [this StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55403663/45375) for details.)\r\n\r\n",
