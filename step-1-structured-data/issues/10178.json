Also, IIRC, `Copy-Item` and `Move-Item` ultimately call the .Net APIs to do the work:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n[io.file]::Copy(\"foo.txt\", \"bar.txt\")\r\n[io.file]::Move(\"foo.txt\", \"bar.txt\")\r\n```\r\nCan you try the APIs and see if the problem is still evident? This might actually be a .Net issue.",
