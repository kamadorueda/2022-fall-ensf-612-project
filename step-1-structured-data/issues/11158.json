That should definitely be maintaining the original type.",

      "body": "> Is this type change to be expected or is it a bug?\r\n\r\nThe serialization infrastructure preserves type fidelity only for a relatively small number of known types (but always records the full, original type name and that of the types in its inheritance hierarchy).\r\n\r\nList-like data structures (collections) are serialized as abstract `<LST>` elements, as described in [Contents of Known Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-psrp/f4bdb166-cefc-4d49-848c-7d08680ae0a7) in the MS-PSRP spec.\r\n\r\nOn deserializing, the various collection types serialized as `<LST>` are seemingly _all_ deserialized as `[System.Collections.ArrayList]` instances.\r\n\r\nWhile there are definitely many cases where type-faithful deserialization _isn't_ possible, you definitely _could_ faithfully \"rehydrate\"  instances of type `[object[]]` (and, obviously, `[System.Collections.ArrayList]` itself, as well as - depending on the specific element type - `[System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]`).\r\n\r\nIt is unclear to me why the deserialize-all-lists-to-`ArrayList` approach was chosen (other than for implementation convenience), though, pragmatically speaking, it probably won't be a problem in practice too often.\r\n\r\n> Is it also to be expected that the ArrayList is considered equal to a PSCustomObject\r\n\r\nThe short of it is that you shouldn't test for custom objects with `-is [pscustomobject]`, because it is effectively the same as `-is [psobject]` (see #4344) and that can _situationally_ return `$true` for _any_ data type instance that happens to be wrapped in an extra, otherwise invisible `[psobject]` instance, as in your case - see #5579.\r\n\r\nInstead, obscurely, you must use `-is [System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject]`, which only returns true for true custom objects.\r\n\r\nThe caveat is that the `-as` variant does _not_ work - see #4343.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
