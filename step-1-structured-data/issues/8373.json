  "body": "Quite simply, I would love to see a build of PowerShell for Android.\r\n\r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\nAs a user of PowerShell, I would like to be able to run it directly from my Android devices without having to use an external service such as Azure Cloud Shell. This would allow me to manage my infrastructure from anywhere easily without requiring any remoting into a dev machine or the use of 3rd party services like the aforementioned Cloud Shell.\r\n",
