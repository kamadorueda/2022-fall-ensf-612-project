When running this script in foreground, no problem. All these commands got executed correctly. But if running this bash script in background like \"bash script.sh &\", after finishing the first pwsh command, process automatically got stopped. You have to use foreground running to finish all of them.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```\r\n# cat pwsh.sh\r\npwsh -Command \"Get-Module  -ListAvailable\"\r\npwsh -Command \"Get-Module  -ListAvailable\"\r\npwsh -Command \"Get-Module  -ListAvailable\"\r\npwsh -Command \"Get-Module  -ListAvailable\"\r\n\r\n# bash pwsh.sh > pwsh.log 2>&1 &\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou will see only the first line executed, then process automatically got stopped.\r\n\r\n```\r\n# jobs\r\n[1]+  Stopped                 bash pwsh.sh > pwsh.log 2>&1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPwsh should be executed according to script in Bash\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nYou will see only the first line executed, then process automatically got stopped.\r\n\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Linux 4.19.76-linuxkit #1 SMP Tue May 26 11:42:35 UTC 2020\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "This doesn't repro on macOS, but on Linux, it appears that background processes will automatically be stopped if it attempts to read from stdin.  Workaround for now is:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npwsh -command \"Get-Module -ListAvailable\" < /dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe input redirection will effectively close stdin, so the process won't be stopped.  It appears that Linux will send a SIGTTIN signal to the process if it tries to read from the console, but is not in the foreground.  However, pwsh doesn't handle signals (because .NET doesn't expose it).  Related to https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11215\r\n",
