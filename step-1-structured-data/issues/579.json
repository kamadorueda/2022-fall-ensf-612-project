As in, users are able to create a new CimInstance with a string representing class name (very basic functionality, but also very important for the previous dsc efforts) `new CimInstance(InstanceHandle)` and other overloads would likely fail, although the code is certainly there to get it passing.  I'll create a separate WI to add CimInstance tests for overloaded constructors.\n",
