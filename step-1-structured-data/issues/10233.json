      "body": "@PowerShellTeam I'd like to take this on. \r\n\r\nI did a bit of quick prototyping. There's a challenge with taking pipeline input on the Payload parameter.\r\n\r\nWhen the event template expects multiple inputs, you could currently invoke the cmdlet like this:\r\n```New-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell -Id 49153 -Payload @('Param1', 'Param2')```\r\n\r\nHowever, passing the Payload array as an object through the pipeline will not work the same:\r\n``` @('Param1', 'Param2') | New-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell -Id 49153```\r\nResults in each member of the input array being processed as individual records. Because of the way the pipeline input arrays get flattened, putting a payload array inside another array has the same result.\r\n\r\nTo overcome this, I'd like to propose that Payload take the value from the pipeline by Property name. This would then work as expected:\r\n```[pscustomobject]@{Payload=@('Param1', 'Param2')} | New-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell -Id 49153```\r\nWith the payload array being treated as a single input record. \r\n\r\nWe can expand on this approach, taking each Parameter as a pipeline value by property name. For example, sending different events to the same provider:\r\n```\r\n$a = [pscustomobject]@{Id=49153;Payload=@('Param1','Param2')}\r\n$b = [pscustomobject]@{Id=49152;Payload='Param1'}\r\n$a,$b | New-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr even sending multiple events to different providers. This would require some additional refactoring to move the LoadProvider and LoadEventDescription calls into the ProcessRecord override. If we require that pipeline input all goes to one provider, then we would only need to load the provider once in BeginProcessing. This would reduce perf overhead, but limit flexibility.\r\n\r\nThe biggest drawback is a custom object has to be created. So sending simple single objects on the pipeline won't work, and there would be perf impacts if creating many events.\r\n\r\nWe could mitigate the single object scenario by taking more strongly typed parameters in separate parameter sets. With a string-only Payload parameter set, we could make this work:\r\n'One', 'Two', 'Three' | New-WinEvent -ProviderName Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell -Id 49153\r\n\r\nThis would multiply the complexity of the implementation, and each payload type we would want to support would need its own parameter set.\r\n",
