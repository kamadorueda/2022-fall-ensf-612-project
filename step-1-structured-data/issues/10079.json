  "body": "Microsoft has a great product, that is windows admin center(WAC), it use PS to connect target, but there is one shortage, it instruct PS to use its default behavior (use port 5985) to connect target , do not have an option to instruct PS to use port 80 or 443 (Compatibility mode) to connect target.\r\n\r\nIn my environment , PS can reach target via port 80 only. For this problem ,I already post a request in WAC user voice -- https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/295071-management-tools/suggestions/38030116-connect-client-via-port-80\r\n\r\nhttps://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/295071-management-tools/suggestions/33981802--configuration-winrm-connect-using-non-default\r\n\r\nAs only a few users have that demand , so WAC team did nothing for my request.\r\n\r\nBut if I can change PS's default behavior -- use port 80 as default , then my WAC problem will go way.\r\n\r\nAny one can provide me a good solution ?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!",
