I don't know how much it relies on BinaryFormatter, but is it possible to replace just the required bits in the PowerShell SDK such that it keeps working? BinaryFormatter may be deprecated, but Windows PowerShell 5.1 will still be officially supported for years to come as it ships built-in with Windows Server ",

It is going to be there for a LONG time, it's built-in to Windows Server, and Windows Server has a long lifetime before reaching its EOL.\n\nI really don't know much about BinaryFormatter, and from Steve's previous answer, it looks like we're using it only in two places (time zones and Out-GridView).

It is benign in nature, and we could make a fix already such that connections work with .NET 6 without re-enabling BinaryFormatter. The real BinaryFormatter APIs are not required, Jordan was able to write custom code for the time zone stuff in his own Python implementation, there aren't that many possible combinations to handle.\n\nAs for Out-GridView, it is only really used interactively, so I suggest we should update the PowerShell server not to use it unless it is already the case, and not bother about backward compatibility since *interactive* PowerShell clients can reasonably switch to PowerShell 7. non-interactive use through the PowerShell SDK is what truly matters.\n\nShould we create a separate issue to add a proper fallback for the time zone stuff in the current code base, link it to this issue? It would fix at least the current problem.\n\nAs for other planned deprecated APIs, are there issues opened for all of them, and can someone link them here so we have a good idea of other issues coming up that would break backward compatibility with Windows PowerShell servers?\n",

      "body": "Looking at the code a bit further, it seems like for the `SessionCapability` message both the client and server exchange don't even use the `TimeZone` value, it just defaults to the default time zone of that host https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/7cc9c874730e87b06dbe54d50e77c1c472996c54/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/common/WireDataFormat/EncodeAndDecode.cs#L2376-L2392. This means that as a client there doesn't seem to be any consequence to omitting the value at all and they both already ignore it. Going back versions, v2 will try to deserialize this value but is fine if it is omitted. PowerShell 3 is when they removed this deserialization on the server due to what looks like security concerns so I'm fairly confident it's ok for PowerShell as a client to just stop sending that field altogether. Event when looking at what ultimately uses this data from the server it seems like it's only set for [PSSenderInfo.ClientTimeZone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.remoting.pssenderinfo.clienttimezone?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0#system-management-automation-remoting-pssenderinfo-clienttimezone) and nothing else internally.\r\n\r\nThe other mentioned usage is with `Out-GridView`, this is not something I'm really knowledgeable on. I cannot even get it working on Linux after following https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/out-gridview-returns/.
