  "body": "I was concerned about #2725 changing file encodings and possibly other characters. If the number of changes was small, I would have just reviewed it, but there a ton of changes.\r\n\r\nI took the script written by @powercode and modified it some to verify we only deleted spaces and tabs, the result is [here](https://gist.github.com/lzybkr/f040f18d1fbfff9eaf3f4533e24126fe).\r\n\r\nWith this extra check, I found 25 or so files where #2725 would have changed characters we might not have wanted changed. Those files are not included in the PR, I'll fix those in another PR - and at the same time fix those funny characters or fix the file encoding to be true ascii.",
