It should still be there as the DllImport for libpsrpclient is still there in git master.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, libpsrpclient was replaced by the psrp package, so a failure to find libpsrpclient is probably a bug.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n1. Create PSSession, my tests were done with -Authentication Credssp with a target of a Windows system\r\n2. Reproduce #3476, but if workaround is applied, reproduce this issue\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nGet into a session.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n```\r\netsn : Unable to load DLL 'libpsrpclient': The specified module could not be found.\r\n (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8007007E)\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ etsn windowsbox -cred (Get-Credential) -Authentication credssp\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Enter-PSSession], DllNotFoundException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.DllNotFoundException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.EnterPSSessionCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value                                                                                                                                                          \r\n----                           -----                                                                                                                                                          \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha                                                                                                                                                    \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                                                                                                                                           \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                                                                        \r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0                                                                                                                                                        \r\nGitCommitId                    Could not find file '/usr/lib/powershell/ubuntu.16.04-x64/powershell.version'.                                                                                 \r\nCLRVersion                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                                                                            \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                                                                            \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1        \r\n```\r\n\r\nVersion from pacman because $PSVersionTable isn't actually saying the version:\r\n\r\nVersion         : 6.0.0.alpha.17-2\r\n",
