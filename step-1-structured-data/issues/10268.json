  "body": "Based on the [current description of `Export-ModuleMember`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/export-modulemember?view=powershell-6#description), aliases and functions should be exported by default from any script module that does not explicitly invoke `Export-ModuleMember`. As you can see from the scenario below, that is not the case for script modules that do not have a manifest.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nnmo -name A {\r\nfunction Test-A {\r\n[CmdletBinding()]\r\n[Alias('ta')]\r\nparam()\r\n\"'$($PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name)' was invoked.\"\r\n}\r\n} | ipmo\r\n\r\nnmo -name B {\r\nfunction Test-B {\r\n[CmdletBinding()]\r\nparam()\r\n\"'$($PSCmdlet.MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name)' was invoked.\"\r\n}\r\nNew-Alias tb Test-B\r\n} | ipmo\r\n\r\nta\r\n\r\ntb\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n'Test-A' was invoked.\r\n'Test-B' was invoked.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nta : The term 'ta' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ ta\r\n+ ~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (ta:String) [], CommandNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException\r\n\r\ntb : The term 'tb' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ tb\r\n+ ~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (tb:String) [], CommandNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this issue is not a regression.
