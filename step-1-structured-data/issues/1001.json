  "body": "Resolves #972.\n\n@paulcallen You will want to test that this doesn't break PSRP, and submit a PR with any necessary changes to fix it.\n\n@vors Please review and sign-off when done. There was an unusually sad amount of code duplication in this last round. Note that I'm not compiling `GetComputerInfoCommand.cs`. If you can get that to work, just add to this branch. I will tag once this is done (so we can rebase if need be). I will also make a branch that we reset to the latest original copy of code, so we can diff easily.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/1001)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
