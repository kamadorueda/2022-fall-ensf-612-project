  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nCurrently `PSDesiredStateConfiguration v2.0.5` module ships inbox with PS releases.\r\n[This module is now published on PS Gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSDesiredStateConfiguration/2.0.5) and should be installed from PS Gallery when necessary by something like `Install-Module -Name PSDesiredStateConfiguration -Repository PSGallery -MaximumVersion 2.99`.\r\nThis PR removes v2.0.5 module from being shipped in future PS releases.\r\n\r\nContext: [Announcing PSDesiredStateConfiguration on PowerShell Gallery](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/announcing-psdesiredstateconfiguration-on-powershell-gallery/).\r\n\r\nSpecial case worth mentioning: this PR removes `PSDesiredStateConfiguration.InvokeDscResource` experimental feature from being enabled by default in future PS Previews (because the module will no longer be shipped with them). This means that users who need that functionality will have to enable this experimental feature after downloading the module from PS Gallery.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] Breaking change documented in blog post.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] Breaking change documented in blog post + [created a doc issue to document this](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/7689).\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [X] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.
