  "body": "Since we rename `powershell` to `pwsh`, the variables `oldPowershellExeName` and the use of it should be removed from [`RemoveSxSPsHomeModulePath`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/ModuleIntrinsics.cs#L768) before RC/GA.\r\n\r\nIt's kept for now because for now people will try opening `pwsh` from existing powershell core.",
