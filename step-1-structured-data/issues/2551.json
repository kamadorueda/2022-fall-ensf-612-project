  "body": "<!--\n\nIf it is a bug report:\n- make sure you are able to repro it on the latest released version. \nYou can install the latest version from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases\n- Search the existing issues.\n- Refer to the [FAQ](../docs/FAQ.md).\n- Refer to the [known issues](../docs/KNOWNISSUES.md).\n- Fill out the following repro template\n\nIf it's not a bug, please remove the template and elaborate the issue in your own words.\n-->\n## Steps to reproduce\n\nThis bug occurs on both PS 4 and 5.0 on Windows 2012R2 remote workflow target machine (non-domain). I'm aware these are not the latest release versions of PS, but we can't really afford to run 6.0 alpha in production :-)\n\nPlease use the attached scripts to reproduce the bug. You will need a Win10 client machine to generate appropriate self-signed SSL certificates.\n1. Execute step.01.ps1 on the \"client\" Win10 machine. It will create two self-signed SSL certificates: one server and one client. It will create server.pfx, server.cer and client.cer in your HOME directory.\n2. Copy server.pfx and client.cer to the Win2012R2 server and import them. Import server.pfx to CERT:\\LocalMachine\\My. Import client.cer to CERT:\\LocalMachine\\Root (Trusted Root CA).\n3. Copy step.02.ps1 to the target server machine and execute it. The script will configure an HTTPS WinRM listenner and remove the HTTP listener. It will also register the client certificate against a specified local server account.\n4. Dot-source step.03.ps1 on the client machine in a PS session and prepare these two variables:\n\n$cert = gi CERT:\\CurrentUser\\My<your certificate hash>\n$cred = Get-Credential -Message \"Please enter server credentials\"\n\nstep.03.ps1 defines two workflows that will be run on the remote server: TestDir and TestRestart. TestDir simply performs \"Get-ChildItems C:\\\" on the target machine, while TestRestart attempts a restart and waits for the target machine to reboot.\n\nRun them using the -PSParameterCollection parameter:\n\nTestDir -PSParameterCollection $p\nor\nTestRestart -PSParameterCollection $p\n\nThere are 3 scenarios to test:\n\nTestRestart fails with \"access denied\" error and an audit failure in the Windows Security event log on the target machine:\n**$p = @(@{PSComputerName = <your server hostname>}, @{PSComputerName = \"*\"; Verbose = $true; PSUseSSL = $true; PSCertificateThumbprint = $cert.Thumbprint } )**\n\nTestRestart restarts the machine, but waits indefinitely until you run 'winrm qc' on the target machine after the reboot to re-enable the HTTP listener\n**$p = @(@{PSComputerName = <your server hostname>; PSCredential = $cred}, @{PSComputerName = \"*\"; Verbose = $true; PSUseSSL = $true } )**\n\nTestRestart works if there is an HTTP listener on the target server and associated firewall rules are enabled\n**$p = @(@{PSComputerName = <your server hostname>; PSCredential = $cred}, @{PSComputerName = \"*\"; Verbose = $true } )**\n\nTestDir works fine in all three cases.\n## Expected behavior\n\nTestRestart should restart the target machine, wait for it to reboot and exit.\n## Actual behavior\n\nWhen using a registered client SSL certificate thumbprint for authentication, TestRestart fails with 'access denied' error and there is a security audit failure event logged in the Windows Security event log.\n\nWhen using PSCredential over SSL, TestRestart restarts the target machine, but waits indefinitely for the reboot confimration until 'winrm qc' is run on the target machine after it has rebooted.\n## Environment data\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\n> $PSVersionTable\n\n```\n\nName                           Value\n\n---\n\nPSVersion                      4.0\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\nBuildVersion                   6.3.9600.17400\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0}\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.2\n\nName                           Value\n\n---\n\nPSVersion                      5.0.10586.117\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\nBuildVersion                   10.0.10586.117\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n\n[steps.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/557000/steps.zip)\n",
