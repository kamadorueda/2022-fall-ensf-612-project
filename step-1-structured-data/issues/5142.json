      "body": "PowerShell currently uses stderror messages to determine if ssh client fails during remoting initial connection, such as an authorization failure or some configuration caused failure, and then reports the failure message to the user.  But this is turning out to be unreliable since ssh passes warnings and (now) banner text stderror too.\r\n\r\nThe banner text comes through stderror and PowerShell cannot distinguish it from a real ssh error, so it closes the session.  PowerShell currently looks for \"WARNING:\" prepended to a stderror message and ignores those.  But I don't see a way to ignore a random string appearing in stderror.\r\n\r\nThis is only for the initial connection and the protocol handles connection errors after that.  I think we will need to add some kind of connection integrity check before starting the protocol to ensure the initial connection succeeded.  It will involve ensuring the ssh client process is alive since it will terminate on error.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the workaround is to not turn on the banner message for sshd configuration.",
