  "body": "In bash and zsh there are very useful options to avoid adding commands to the shell history when they are prefixed with a space:\r\n\r\n- https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/115922/2505 (bash)\r\n- https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/48306/2505 (zsh)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if PS had this feature as well, since sometimes you want to run some long command, knowing that you won't need it again, and thus not bother adding it to the history. This is particularly useful when using a very large max history size (in my zsh I have more than 10000, since I like having access to all commands I executed).\r\n\r\nIt would also be useful when some other program runs a shell command, since those are usually even more meaningless when you later use a shell \"manually\".",
