      "body": "> Starting powershell 7.2pre6 in win11 often results in a green screen. \r\n\r\nThanks for the bug report. I think we need more information to be able to investigate this on our end, for example the operating system version/build number.\r\n\r\nAlso, given that the two variables here are the PowerShell version and the Windows version, and that the same PowerShell version does not cause kernel panics on other versions of Windows, this sounds like the bug belongs to Windows rather than PowerShell. Even in the case where PowerShell is the cause of the bug, the operating system should be able to handle an application failure without a kernel panic.\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, I'll close this issue for now. If you're able to add more information (for example a dump), please let us know (particularly for a dump file, you might need to send that through by other means) and we'll be happy to revisit the issue.",
