  "body": "I'm running a PowerShell script remotely on my Windows 10 machine. Connected remotely via WinRM + PowerShell Runspace.\r\nHowever, I'm experiencing issues with the **Runspace Disconnect** feature \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMy source machine: Linux\r\nMy target machine: Windows 10 x64, running PS version `5.1.18362.752`, WinRM enabled, PS Remoting enabled\r\n\r\nI've played around and tested PS Runspace Disconnect feature using this C# snippet:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.Management.Automation;\r\nusing System.Management.Automation.Runspaces;\r\nusing System.Net;\r\nusing System.Threading.Tasks;\r\n\r\nnamespace PSDisconnect\r\n{\r\n    internal static class Program\r\n    {\r\n        public static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            MainAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        private static async Task MainAsync()\r\n        {\r\n            var username = \"username\"; // < --- set username\r\n            var password = \"password\"; // < --- set password\r\n            var ipAddress = \"10.10.220.104\"; // < --- set ip address\r\n            \r\n            WSManConnectionInfo connectionInfo = new WSManConnectionInfo(false, ipAddress, 5985, \"/wsman\", \"http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/Microsoft.PowerShell\", new PSCredential(username, new NetworkCredential(\"\", password).SecurePassword));\r\n            connectionInfo.AuthenticationMechanism = AuthenticationMechanism.Negotiate;\r\n\r\n            using var runspacePool = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspacePool(1, 5, connectionInfo);\r\n            runspacePool.Open();\r\n            var powerShell = PowerShell.Create();\r\n            powerShell.RunspacePool = runspacePool;\r\n\r\n            string scriptContent = \"\\nfunction Test-GetPSInfo {\\nreturn $PSVersionTable.PSVersion\\n}\\n\";\r\n            await powerShell.AddScript(scriptContent).InvokeAsync();\r\n\r\n            var results = await powerShell.AddCommand(\"Test-GetPSInfo\").InvokeAsync();\r\n            foreach (var result in results)\r\n            {\r\n                Console.Out.WriteLine(result.ToString());\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            runspacePool.Disconnect();\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis fail to work as expected. I'm getting the following error below stating wrongly that my target machine's PowerShell version is below version 3.0 which is incorrect since my target machine is running PowerShell version `5.1.18362.752`\r\n\r\noutput: \r\n\r\n> 5.1.18362.752\r\n> Unhandled exception. System.Management.Automation.PSInvalidOperationException: The Disconnect operation is not supported on the server.  The server must be running Windows PowerShell 3.0 or greater for remote runspace pool disconnection support.\r\n>    at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.Internal.RemoteRunspacePoolInternal.BeginDisconnect(AsyncCallback callback, Object state)\r\n>    at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.Internal.RemoteRunspacePoolInternal.Disconnect()\r\n>    at System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.RunspacePool.Disconnect()\r\n\r\nIf anyone knows if this is supported or what am I doing wrong - I would appreciate sharing \ud83d\ude4f",
