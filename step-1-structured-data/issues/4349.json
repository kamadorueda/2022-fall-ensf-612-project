  "body": "Judging by the _documented_ CLI - as reported by `powerhshell -?` - `-s` _should_ imply `-STA`, because it is the only option whose name starts with `s`.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is an _undocumented_ `-servermode` switch that is _actually_ used when you pass just `-s`.\r\n\r\nIt looks like both options mistakenly define `-s` as an alias (see [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/CommandLineParameterParser.cs#L561) and [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/CommandLineParameterParser.cs#L716)), which results in the first one being checked to be chosen (`-servermode`) rather than an error about an ambiguous parameter name having been used.\r\n\r\n_Update_: I now see  that `-s` for `-servermode` is apparently used by PowerShell itself when spawning background processes for background jobs.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the CLI help should be updated to at least mention that `-s` is short for `-servermode` and cannot be used as a shorthand for `-STA`.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on macOS 10.12.5\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.15063.413 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\n```\r\n",
