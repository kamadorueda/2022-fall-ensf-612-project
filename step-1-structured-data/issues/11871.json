But it doesn't. Or I am doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nI used Visual Studio's NuGet package Manager Console to get CSOM:\r\n`Install-Package Microsoft.SharePointOnline.CSOM -Version 16.1.20211.12000`\r\n\r\nIn the end in my Visual Studio project I got this subfolder:\r\n`\\packages\\Microsoft.SharePointOnline.CSOM.16.1.20211.12000\\lib`\r\n\r\nwhich has these subfolders:\r\njavascript\r\nnet40-full\r\nnet45\r\nnetcore45\r\nnetstandard2.0\r\nportable-net45+netcore45+wpa81\r\nwpa\r\n\r\nI tried to use these files:\r\nMicrosoft.SharePoint.Client.Portable.dll\r\nMicrosoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.Portable.dll\r\n\r\nfrom \"net45\" folder and \"portable-net45+netcore45+wpa81\", but non of them work - I got the same error as in the first post.\r\nBasically I have tried those two dll files from all folders and my script works from Windows PowerShell 5.1, but doesn't work in PowerShell 7.\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.uservoice.com/logo/design_setting/259177/original/SharePoint_logo_140x40_2x.png?1552927617\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://a.gfx.ms/OLFav.ico\" height=\"14\"> SharePoint Experiences in Office365 and/or SharePoint Server</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329220-sharepoint-dev-platform/suggestions/16585795-support-net-core-with-csom\">Support .NET Core with CSOM</a></strong></div><div>Support .NET Core with CSOM</div></blockquote>",
