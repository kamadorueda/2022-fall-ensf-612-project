With the picker, just type `pow` and the process list will filter down to the PowerShell processes.  Just pick the desired process to attach to based on the PID (or command line).",

This is a feature of the C#/.NET Core debugger and if you specify `processId`, then you are not supposed to specify `processName`. \r\n\r\nAlso, eventually you might want to attach to a host named something other than PowerShell.  :-)  Besides, when you press <kbd>F5</kbd> to attach, the process list will appear, type `pow` and the list will immediately filter down to just the powershell processes.",
