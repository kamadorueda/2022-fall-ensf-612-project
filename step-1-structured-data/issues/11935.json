I obtained this by running:\r\n\r\n`[System.Enum]::GetValues('ConsoleColor') | ForEach-Object { Write-Host $_ -ForegroundColor $_ }`\r\n\r\nIn particular, \"Yellow\" in 6.2.4 is very light and subdued.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that you can change the colors around, say I want error messages to be \"Cyan\" instead of Red.\r\n\r\nHowever, how can I go about changing the value of the color itself? In this case, yellow.\r\n\r\n**I want the yellow in 6.2.4 to reflect the yellow in 5.1. How do I do this?** Thank you!",

Just make sure you set the `Screen Text` color back to the index just to the right of the dark yellow index (square).  \r\n\r\nWindows Terminal handles this in a completely different way, allowing you to specify a named color scheme (including any custom color schemes you define) in the profiles.json file for Windows Terminal:\r\n```\r\n      {\r\n        // Make changes here to the cmd.exe profile\r\n        \"colorScheme\": \"Campbell\",\r\n        \"guid\": \"{0caa0dad-35be-5f56-a8ff-afceeeaa6101}\",\r\n        \"name\": \"cmd\",\r\n        \"commandline\": \"cmd.exe\",\r\n        \"hidden\": false\r\n      },\r\n```",
