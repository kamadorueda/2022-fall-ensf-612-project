All output from the block is written into the output pipeline, even if the output of the block should be redirected into a variable, or a pipeline inside the function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction x([switch]$p) {\r\n    $null = foreach ($a in @(1)) {\r\n        echo \"this should not be visible\"\r\n        if ($p) {return}\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nfunction y([switch]$p) {\r\n    $null = try {echo \"this should not be visible\"; if ($p) {return}} catch {}\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> x\r\nPS> y\r\nPS> x -p\r\nPS> y -p\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> x\r\nPS> y\r\nPS> x -p\r\nthis should not be visible\r\nPS> y -p\r\nthis should not be visible\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.3.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.3.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

And I don't think it is as consistent as it might be.  But \"**accumulator**\" piqued my curiosity. Here are multiple evolutions of the same bit of code\r\n \r\n```powershell\r\nfunction test {\r\n   while ($null -eq $x) {\r\n         $global:foo = foreach ($x in 1..5) {\r\n            if ($x -eq 5) { return } \r\n            else {$x} \r\n        }\r\n        \"after the loop, x =$x \"\r\n    }\r\n    \"After the while\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does what the OP saw. It **looks like** it should put the values into `foo` but it doesn't and they become \"output\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n#531 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo = $null \r\n\r\n#532 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo \r\n\r\n#533 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> test\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n\r\n#534 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo \r\n```\r\n\r\nWe [should] know that (without the return) the code would NOT put 1 into foo, then  make foo an array and add 2 as member , then add 3 etc. - most of have us have learnt at a loop with `$results = $results + $LatestItem`  gets slow for many items and `$result = <loop>` is to be preferred because PowerShell **accumulates** the results for us and assigns them in a single operation after the `for` loop has run. \r\n\r\nWe do not really think about the \"Call something, and when execution returns the output you want will be a standard buffer\" which underpins all of this, any more than we think about \r\n```powershell\r\n  $val = foreach ($x in 1..5) {\r\n            if ($x -eq 5) { throw } \r\n            else {$x} \r\n        } \r\n```\r\nputting 1..4 in the output buffer and then having `throw` remove them (they must have gone _somewhere_ but they don't reach `$val`).  \r\nIn this case `return` has inserted a GOTO between putting the results  into the buffer and reading them back;  `Return`, `Break`, `Continue `are all forms of GOTO by other means (see below before arguing! :-) )  -  `return` means execution goes to whatever **called** this function  instead of the next step **of** this function..  \r\n\r\nWe can see the same thing with `break`, where (again) the behaviour is not intuitive.  Someone who has learnt what `return` does in this case, but not _why_, might expect this to do the same \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction test {\r\n    while ($null -eq $x) {\r\n         $global:foo = foreach ($x in 1..5) {\r\n            if ($x -eq 5) { break  } \r\n            else {$x} \r\n        }\r\n        \"after the loop x =$x \"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\"After the while\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nAll that has changed is the `return` has been replaced with a `break`  - which  exits the `for` but not the `while`  so execution continues where it would have done _without_ `break`  \r\n```\r\n#540 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo = $null \r\n\r\n#541 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo\r\n\r\n#542 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> test\r\nafter the loop x =5 \r\nAfter the while\r\n\r\n#543 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo \r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI said \"wait before arguing about goto\"  - in this case `break` is just making the \"if_not_condition run_the_remainder_of_the_code\" construction less unwieldy - the point it is  going to isn't _arbitrary_  it is what would be the next step anyway. But it **can** go to other places using _labels._ \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\nfunction test {\r\n :myLabel    while ($null -eq $x) {\r\n         $global:foo = foreach ($x in 1..5) {\r\n            if ($x -eq 5) { break myLabel } \r\n            else {$x} \r\n        }\r\n        \"after the loop x =$x \"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n\"After the while\"\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\nThis is just the last version with  a label but now the output looks like the first version. \r\n\r\n```\r\n#545 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo = $null \r\n\r\n#546 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo\r\n\r\n#547 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> test\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\nAfter the while\r\n\r\n#548 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> $foo \r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess the TL;DR version for the above is **\"Don't put a GOTO in the right hand side of an assignment\"** \r\n\r\nBut just when think we know how these things behave   What about  \r\n```PowerShell\r\nfunction test2 {\r\n\r\ntry     {\"Hello\" ; return}\r\ncatch   {\"Never runs\"}\r\nfinally {\"Good bye\"} \r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf return is _immediate successful exit_  (like throw is an immediate failure) as we have seen `finally` would never run but this code produces the following output \r\n\r\n```\r\n#532 PS5 ~\\Documents\\windowsPowershell> test2\r\nHello\r\nGood bye\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing the runs after after the `try/catch/finally` but the goto effect isn't immediate\r\n",
