I think it would be more consistent to unwrap any single parameter passed as `ValueFromRemainingArguments`, while #5109 propose to unwrap only collections.",

And I do not see other way to fix #5122, thus I see no value in keeping this PR open. I do not closing #5122 though. If someone know how to fix it, then them can submit their own PR instead of this one.",
