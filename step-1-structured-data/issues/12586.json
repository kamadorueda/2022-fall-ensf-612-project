  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nOn long copy (especially over the network) it is unclear if copying is done at all. Progress bar that shows that operation is really working and progressing (and where it is currently stuck and for how long) would definitely help.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThere should be switch for Copy-Item that would write progress via Write-Progress. Progress should include:\r\n- time spent already\r\n- bytes copied already\r\n- currently copied file\r\n- (optional, this can be tricky to calculate) estimate percent done of the copy operation. This is optional. If it is network copy it can take lots of time to enumerate files and calculate their total size. If that takes more than a second, I'd rather this estimate would be dropped altogether.",
