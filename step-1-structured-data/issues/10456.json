  "body": "I'm running a net core console application with PowerShell SDK version 7.0.0-preview.2. The application is self-contained.\r\nFor testing, this application shall start another .exe with the start-process command. \r\nRunning this application on windows 10 works great. The exe opens as expected. \r\n\r\nRunning this application on windows 7 does not work. The error (in the streams.error) containes the message \"Cannot find drive. A drive with the name 'C' does not exist. \r\n\r\nTo reproduce. \r\nCreate a net core 3 console application and add the Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK 7.0.0-preview.3 nuget packages. \r\nThe code running in main: \r\n\r\n                using (var runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace())\r\n                {\r\n                    runspace.Open();\r\n\r\n                    var proxy = runspace.SessionStateProxy;\r\n\r\n                    using (var ps = PowerShell.Create())\r\n                    {\r\n                        ps.Runspace = runspace;\r\n\r\n                        ps.AddScript(\"start-process notepad.exe -wait\");\r\n                        \r\n                        ps.Invoke().ToList();\r\n\r\n                        foreach(var error in ps.Streams.Error)\r\n                        {\r\n                            Console.WriteLine(error);\r\n                        }\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT: \r\n\r\nI can also see that when using Get-PSDrive from my console application the C drive is not found. Running the same command from both powershell installed with windows 7 and PowerShell 7 the c drive is listed. \r\nTopwindow is the console application, rest is powershell window in the image below.\r\n\r\n\r\n![drivenotfound](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/618919/63930016-c9022200-ca52-11e9-8a0d-9a29be375caf.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
