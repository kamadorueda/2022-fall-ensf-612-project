But after typing `brew cask install powershell`, I was greeted with a `Password:` prompt:\r\n<img width=\"830\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/984080/64465063-79110400-d0bf-11e9-8643-eb7662b06c66.png\">\r\n\r\nI have _never_ had a homebrew package ask me for my password. (I currently have about 60 packages installed.) This makes me feel really uncomfortable... I've decided not to install it after all.",
