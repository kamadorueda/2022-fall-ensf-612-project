My Terminal window was 150 characters wide so that it could fit in the output for the OS line without truncating it.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n```\r\nPS /Users/kai> $PSVersionTable                                                                                                                        \r\n\r\nName                           Value                                                                                                                 \r\n----                           -----                                                                                                                 \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-rc                                                                                                              \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                                                                                                  \r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-rc                                                                                                             \r\nOS                             Darwin 16.7.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.7.0: Thu Jun 15 17:36:27 PDT 2017; root:xnu-3789.70.16~2/RELEASE_X86_64        \r\nPlatform                       Unix                                                                                                                  \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                               \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                                   \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                                                                                               \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                                   \r\n```",
