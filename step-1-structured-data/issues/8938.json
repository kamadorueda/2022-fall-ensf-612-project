  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nExpands line continuance for pipelines to allow lines to continue automatically without backticks with the pipe symbol at the start of a line. This adds to the existing functionality where pipes can be used to continue lines by placing them at the end of a line.\r\n\r\nSupported methods to wrap pipelines that existed before this PR:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Wrapping with a pipe at the end of a line\r\nGet-Process | Where CPU | Where Path |\r\n    Get-Item | Where FullName -match \"AppData\" | \r\n    Sort FullName -Unique\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Wrapping with a backtick at the end of a line and a pipe at the beginning of a line\r\nGet-Process | Where CPU | Where Path `\r\n    | Get-Item | Where FullName -match \"AppData\" `\r\n    | Sort FullName -Unique\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional supported methods to wrap pipelines with this PR in place:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Wrapping with a pipe at the beginning of a line (no backtick required)\r\nGet-Process | Where CPU | Where Path\r\n    | Get-Item | Where FullName -match \"AppData\"\r\n    | Sort FullName -Unique\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Wrapping with a pipe on a line by itself (this comes automatically with\r\n# the addition of parser support for wrapping with a pipe at the beginning\r\n# of a line since PowerShell already supported wrapping with a pipe at the\r\n# end of a line)\r\nGet-Process | Where CPU | Where Path\r\n    |\r\n    Get-Item | Where FullName -match \"AppData\"\r\n    |\r\n    Sort FullName -Unique\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nSee #3020.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed: [3746](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/3746)\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` to your commit messages if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
