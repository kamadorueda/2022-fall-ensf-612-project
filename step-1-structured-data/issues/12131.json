      "body": "@DanielSSilva, that's indeed the difference: \r\n\r\nWithout `-Raw`, the bytes are _streamed_, i.e. emitted _one by one_, as individual `[byte]` instances _as they're being read_.\r\n\r\nWith `-Raw`, by design, a `[byte[]]` array comprising all bytes in the input file is created in memory first, which is then emitted _as a whole_, as a single object.\r\n\r\nIn the streaming case, letting PowerShell collect the output in an array (`$bytes = Get-Content -AsByteStream ...`) will (a) result in an `[object[]]` array (that happens to contain `[byte]` values) and (b) will be much slower than using `-Raw`, due to the overhead of streaming one by one.\r\n\r\n",
