Having a PowerShell MSIX package which installs correctly without the Store is not supported right now. Are you asking for a sandboxed MSIX package?",

Actually, installation of them via Microsoft Store is \u2013 or was until recently, if what you have stated is correct \u2013 not possible.\r\n\r\nResearch the \u2018runFullTrust\u2019 capability. Additionally, because PowerShell has already been distributed via the Microsoft Store at \u2018http://microsoft.com/p/powershell/9mz1snwt0n5d\u2019, I am confident that PowerShell has been packaged as MSIX. My sole proposition is addition of this to \u2018http://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases\u2019.",
