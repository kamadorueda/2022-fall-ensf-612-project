I happen to have newer version of the SDK (2.0.2) on my machine and without this file, the build attempts to use the newer version of the SDK which doesn't work.\r\n\r\nBTW if you have 2.0.2 installed, without this file when you run `Start-PSBuild` you get this warning and the build stops - even if you have 2.0.0 installed:\r\n```\r\n5> Start-PSBuild\r\nWARNING: The currently installed .NET Command Line Tools is not the required version.\r\n\r\nInstalled version: 2.0.2\r\nRequired version: 2.0.0\r\n\r\nFix steps:\r\n\r\n1. Remove the installed version from:\r\n    - on windows '$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Microsoft\\dotnet'\r\n    - on macOS and linux '$env:HOME/.dotnet'\r\n2. Run Start-PSBootstrap or Install-Dotnet\r\n3. Start-PSBuild -Clean\r\n```",

      "body": "Any update on this?  I'm constantly having to create this file on every new branch I create. Otherwise, I can't build.  Plus this allows the PowerShell team to specify *which* version of the SDK is requires.  This will reduce contributor issues when their build fails with the message above.  And when the team is ready to move to a later version of the SKD like 2.0.2, the global.json can be updated to reflect that change.",
