  "body": "I opened doc issue https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/5549 about 7.0 LTS.\r\nWe could discuss this here.\r\n\r\nFor .Net Core it is simple:\r\n- 3.1 is LTS with EOL in 09/2022\r\n- 3.1.x is servicing patches (no minor updates!)\r\n- next LTS every 2 year\r\n\r\nSince PowerShell 7.0 is based on .Net Core 3.1 and this cause questions:\r\n- Will we have only patch servicing like 7.0.x next 3 years?\r\n- If so, what will be the next dev version? 7.1? And it will be released as not LTS? and based on .Net Core 5.0?\r\n- .Net Core team will release LTS versions every 2 year. Do we follow this too? Do we really need so many LTS versions? What will be version numbering? .Net Core 6.0 LTS - PowerShell 7.2.0 or 8.0?\r\n- So we release LTS and non-LTS every 2 year? Or non-LTS every half a year as we did for 6.x? But in the case 7.1 should be on 3.1.\r\n- If servicing release support is 3 months after previous release it conflicts with .Net Core servicing release because support for last one will end before PowerShell support.\r\n\r\n/cc @joeyaiello @SteveL-MSFT ",
