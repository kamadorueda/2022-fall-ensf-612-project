  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nSometimes I need to make installations that based on EXE files.  usually , I just need to issue \r\n`Start-Process -FilePath C:\\path\\to\\file.exe -ArgumentList  \"/S\" `\r\nThen everything is on its way. Occasionally, some package does not support silent installation.\r\nIt just pop up a dialog box and let me choose yes or no.\r\nSo annoying and that's why I hope developer to add a -yes-like parameter to start-process , that then help me answer all \"yes/no\" to yes.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nNo idea, I am just a user.\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
