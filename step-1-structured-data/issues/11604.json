  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nInitially for 7.0, we accepted a change to have [DBNull]::Value treated as $null.  The expectation is that this would make it easier for DB users where their content may contain a DBNull and not require them to explicit check that as well as $null.  However, this introduced other issues:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11084\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10980\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10404\r\n\r\n(note that we should probably treat NullString and AutomationNull equivalently)\r\n\r\nSo we had to revert that change before 7.0 GA (**note:** that change was reverted in rc.2 release branch which will be used for GA release, but kept in the master branch for now).  We would still like to investigate whether such a change (or perhaps a different change) makes sense and consider all peripheral impact (so not just `-eq`, but `-lt`, etc... as well as how it works with null coalescing, etc...)\r\n",

In the rare case that you do want to check if the database even had anything to give you'd check the other field.\r\n\r\nI think this solution is likely the closest we're likely to get to that more friendly user experience for handling database values at present, at least until the database APIs get replaced with a newer library entirely (which likely won't happen for quite a few years yet).\r\n\r\nThe hard part is, as @SteveL-MSFT mentioned in the original post, there are some edge cases we'd need to account for when doing this special handling, and we want to be sure we're handling it appropriately in those cases as well. \ud83d\ude42 ",

The absence of a value instead of the absence of an object or object property.

In SQL we use IS (NOT) NULL, which matches obviously to DbNull here.\r\n\r\nSo as the two have a different meaning if I do something like this\r\n\r\n````\r\nCREATE TABLE HasNUlls (id INT,somenullshere varchar(3))\r\n\r\nINSERT INTO HasNUlls VALUES \r\n(1,NULL),\r\n(2,'1'),\r\n(3,'5'),\r\n(4,'115'),\r\n(5,NULL)\r\n````\r\nand ask the database to return the somenullshere column where ID = 5 (Where it is a database NULL) and where ID = 6 (where it doesnt exist) I get a different response.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/72623296-c5f1ca80-393c-11ea-8cb8-d1bcc3ba87fc.png)\r\n\r\nand the same in pwsh\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/72623613-647e2b80-393d-11ea-8dbf-61492f16d390.png)\r\n\r\nand they are not the same :-)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/72623718-89729e80-393d-11ea-8ff4-2cfc56aff9b9.png)\r\n\r\nwhich is what is required otherwise you are hiding the difference between the two and perpetuating the impression that DbNull -eq $null\r\n\r\nI might do something like this\r\n\r\n````\r\n$Query = \"SELECT * FROM HasNulls\"\r\n$AllOfThem = Invoke-DbaQuery -SqlInstance $sqlinstance -Database tempdb -Query $query\r\n$dbnull = [System.DBNull]::Value\r\n$AllOfThem | Where somenullshere -eq $null\r\n$AllOfThem | Where somenullshere -eq $dbnull\r\n````\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6729780/72624617-326dc900-393f-11ea-8109-c995457c0730.png)\r\n\r\nThe last command might be returning the SQL Instances that my information gathering scripts have not gathered any information for. (To be honest this is a made up example with flaws as I would probably use SQL to do the data munching here as that is what it is good for) \r\n\r\nThe first command might help me to find any SQL Instances that I have not got in my reference table.These are two different things.\r\n\r\nThe complication comes when you dont know what you are returning and need another comparison (as @vexx32  says) but personally, I think people need to code for the two options.\r\n\r\nThis I think is how it should be for -lt -gt etc comparisons as well. \r\n\r\nI would like \r\n\r\n`$AllOfThem | Where somenullshere -eq [System.DBNull]::Value`\r\n\r\nto work without first setting it to a variable and if there was a $DatabaseNull variable that would be even better (but naming it would be hard to avoid breaking things (like my scripts!))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/SimpleTalk.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/gatebase-favicon.png\" height=\"14\"> Simple Talk</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/sql/t-sql-programming/how-to-get-nulls-horribly-wrong-in-sql-server/\">How to Get NULLs Horribly Wrong in SQL Server - Simple Talk</a></strong></div><div>NULLs in SQL are a mixed blessing.

I've worked with SQL Server, MySQL, and other databases for years.  I understand the difference, but personally I wouldn't mind if DBNull.Value was replaced by $null entirely.  It's greatly simplifies usage in PowerShell and if you know the datasource, you can understand the origin of the null.  And if you don't know the origin of the data, you won't understand the DBNull anyway.  Heck, I had to write a function Remove-DBNull to replace DBNull with null in result sets.  It sucks since it slows down usage of the results, but it makes it much easier to use.
