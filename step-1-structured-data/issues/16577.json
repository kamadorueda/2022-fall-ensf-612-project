The fix for the completion code is here: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/CommandCompletion/CompletionCompleters.cs#L1332 just update the if statement so it doesn't look for commands if the wordToComplete is just a single dash.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/49609581/aad0ad80-cdec-11ea-8248-a37bc0571bfd\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell\">PowerShell/CompletionCompleters.cs at master \u00b7 PowerShell/PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>PowerShell for every system!
