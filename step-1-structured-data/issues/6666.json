  "body": "- I have been trying to write a set of C# cmdlets and package them up in a module for PowershellGallery.\r\n- I followed the documentation for writing Cmdlets and am compiling it with `dotnet build`.\r\n- I generated a module manifest .psd1 and referenced the output DLL in `RequiredAssemblies`.\r\n- When I run `Import-Module my.psd1`, I get no error, but invoking any of the cmdlets fails with an error that the cmdlet is not recognized. `Get-Module` shows that the module was loaded but `ExportedCommands` is empty.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is a bug in PowerShell or I am doing something wrong, but this is a very frustrating dev experience. If I am doing something wrong, I would expect some kind of error message or better documentation on what needs to be done to hook up C# cmdlets to Powershell.\r\n\r\nHere's the repository to reproduce: https://github.com/felixfbecker/ps-kubectl\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value                                                                                   \r\n----                           -----                                                                                   \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.1                                                                                   \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                                                                    \r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.1                                                                                  \r\nOS                             Darwin 17.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 17.5.0: Mon Mar  5 22:24:32 PST 2018; root:xnu-45...\r\nPlatform                       Unix                                                                                    \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                 \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                     \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                                                                 \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                     \r\n```\r\n",

It is obvious for normal modules, but for C# I assumed I had to add it to `RequiredAssemblies`. ",
