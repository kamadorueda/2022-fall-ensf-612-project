  "body": "I swear I saw this reported already but couldn't find it.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAttempt to use a variable namespace notation to access a filesystem object via the appropriate filesystem drive, then use tab completion/intellisense to complete a portion of the path.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n${C:\\Users\\<CTRL SPACE>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nExpected to offer and correctly complete from a list of user folders.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe user folders are shown, but immediately the completion has corrupted the command line with only `$C:<USER FOLDER>`\r\n\r\nIts keeping only the drive and the currently selected text, and possibly braces if the selected text contains spaces or other specific characters as required for the notation.\r\n\r\nAll versions seem affected by this.\r\n\r\nI will try to evaluate this while looking at other completion issues, to get an idea if its a simple fix or not.\r\n",
