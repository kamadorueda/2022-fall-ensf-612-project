  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\nWhen installing powershell from `msi`, there is an option to add context menu additions for opening Powershell in a folder (when right clicking). The same is not true for the Windows Store version (Powershell Preview).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8770194/91845836-2af2fa00-ec5a-11ea-84cf-f65c3479ad1f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8770194/91845897-46f69b80-ec5a-11ea-88cc-20e2930f7306.png)\r\n\r\nMaybe it would be possible to allow this option via \"App Settings > Add-ons & downloadable content\"? It would be great if we can get the auto-updating features of the store version, but still having feature parity with the `msi` installation.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n1. Install Powershell Preview from the store\r\n2. (optional) Enable context menu items\r\n3. Right click inside a folder in File Explorer\r\n4. \"Open with Powershell\" item should be available\r\n",
