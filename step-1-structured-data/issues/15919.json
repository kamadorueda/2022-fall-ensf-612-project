  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR adds 39 tests to validate and track the existing command error handling behaviors.\r\nThis PR is a preparation for #15177. The new tests added here will protect regressions that could be introduced to the command error handling by #15177.\r\n\r\nPlease be noted that those tests are by no means covering every aspect of the error handling behaviors.\r\nI tried to cover most of the subtle behaviors -- some are not well known and may even be a little confusing to some extent. This is because these subtle behaviors may not be well tested, and adding those new tests will help guard me from introducing regression without knowing when working on #15177.\r\nFor the more obvious/common behaviors, I hope they are already covered by existing tests.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n",

I believe being more aggressive grouping the remaining `It` tests will make the tests even harder to read.",
