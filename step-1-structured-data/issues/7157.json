      "body": "This behavior is so subtle that people might have been implicitly taking advantage of the fact that delay-bind scripts doesn't **pollute** the caller's scope.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that pipeline-extraction scripts (`ValueFromPipeline(ByPropertyName)`) are mapping that are supposed to be pure (free of side-effect), while clearly `ForEach-Object` is more on the side of imperative paradigm, resembling the `foreach` statement. The choice for `Where-Object` is somehow arbitrary, but is useful for the case\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$i = 0;\r\nGet-Items | Where-Object { (++$i) % 2 }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne might ask why such usage wouldn't benefit the pipeline-extraction scenario, i.e., **what's wrong if we execute the extraction scripts in the caller's scope**. The answer is that there might be multiple parameters delay-bound. If the extraction script blocks have side effects, the order of extraction would affect the result. E.g., consider\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Imaginary\r\n$i = 0;\r\nGet-SomeItem | Use-SomePipeline -IndexMod2 { <# ??? #> } -IndexMod3 { <# ??? #> }\r\n\r\n# Currently possible version\r\n$i = [pscustomobject]@{ 'Value' = 0 };\r\nGet-SomeItem | Use-SomePipeline -IndexMod2 { <# ??? #> } -IndexMod3 { <# ??? #> }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to write the script correctly without knowing the order of delay-binding -- should I increase `$i` in the script for `IndexMod2` or `IndexMod3`? I'm not sure whether PowerShell has the order of which parameter is bound before which documented. If that's undocumented, that's undefined to me, and if the extraction scripts had side effects, the whole script wouldn't be useful because of undefined behavior.\r\n\r\nThe invocation order for `ForEach-Object` and `Where-Object` is clear, so it makes sense to allow execution in the caller's scope.",

      "body": "> clearly ForEach-Object is more on the side of imperative paradigm\r\n\r\nAgreed. For `Foreach-Object` and `Where-Object`, running in the caller's scope allows us to do more than just writing results to the pipeline.\r\nAlso, `Foreach-Object` has `-Begin`, `-Process` and `-End` three script blocks, and they need to run in the same scope.\r\n\r\nAs for delay-bind script blocks in parameter binding, the purpose is simply to do some quick transformation/calculation on the value from pipeline, and it makes sense to isolate the execution to not pollute the caller's scope.",
