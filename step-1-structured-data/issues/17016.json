  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nSelecting just the first occurrence in a [`switch` statement](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_switch) is a quiet common usage (which also appears from the given examples).\r\nIt would be nice to have a `-First` (or something similar, as e.g. `-FirstMatchOnly`, `-AutoBreak`) switch to automatically break after the first match. \r\nThis will prevent repeating myself with `; break` statements or possibly forget it.\r\n\r\nIn other words, current statement:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nswitch (2, 4)\r\n{\r\n    1 {\"It is one.\"; Break}\r\n    2 {\"It is two.\" ; Break }\r\n    3 {\"It is three.\" ; Break }\r\n    4 {\"It is four.\" ; Break }\r\n    Default {\"No match found.\"}\r\n}\r\nIt is two.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWishful thinking:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nswitch (2, 4) -First\r\n{\r\n    1 {\"It is one.\" }\r\n    2 {\"It is two.\" }\r\n    3 {\"It is three.\" }\r\n    4 {\"It is four.\" }\r\n    Default {\"No match found.\"}\r\n}\r\nIt is two.\r\n```\r\n",
