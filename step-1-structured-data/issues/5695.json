  "body": "PowerShell checks whether to log script block activities in [`ShouldLogScriptBlockActivity`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/CompiledScriptBlock.cs#L1478), which query Registry on windows to get the configuration via [`GetGroupPolicySetting`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Utils.cs#L527). However, `GetGroupPolicySetting` does nothing on Unix, and thus script block activity logging cannot be enabled on Unix.\r\n\r\nA potential fix is to make PowerShell checks against an entry in `pwsh.runtimeconfig.json`.",
