  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nSome ISPs are rejecting email sent using Send-MailMessage with the following error:\r\n\r\nSend-MailMessage : Command parameter not implemented. The server response was: 5.5.2 <COMPUTERNAME>: Helo command\r\nrejected: need fully-qualified hostname.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nSend a correctly formed FQDN in the EHLO command as laid out in the RFC.\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n1. Concatenate the NetBIOS name and the primary DNS suffix into a valid FQDN and use _it_ in the EHLO command.\r\n2. Provide a switch to override the hostname used in EHLO with an arbitrary value.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nUsing WireShark can see that:\r\n- On a computer with no primary DNS suffix configured, Send-MailMessage sends the computer's NetBIOS name.\r\n- On a computer with a valid primary DNS suffix, Send-MailMessage still sends the computer's NetBIOS name only.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nSend-MailMessage : Command parameter not implemented. The server response was: 5.5.2 <COMPUTERNAME>: Helo command rejected: need fully-qualified hostname.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.20348.859\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.20348.859\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "Hi Steve, thank you for your reply. I believe you are confusing the receiving MTA's FQDN/IP address specified by the -SmtpServer parameter with the client's name by which it introduces itself to the target MTA in the EHLO command.\r\n\r\nThe Send-MailMessage cmdlet does not seem to implement a parameter to specify the hostname used in EHLO - see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/send-mailmessage?view=powershell-7.2.\r\n\r\nNeither (Get-Command Send-MailMessage).Parameters, nor the above article list any option to override what's passed by EHLO to the receiving MTA.\r\n\r\nI need an FQDN passed by EHLO instead of a NetBIOS name. Send-MailMessage either needs to synthetize it by combining the NetBIOS name with the primary DNS suffix, or to let me override the default via a dedicated optional parameter such as -EhloHostName \"sendinghost.domain.tld\".\r\n\r\nSupporting screenshots:\r\n1. Hostname and primary DNS suffix - how the EHLO hostname should be composed in order to be accepted even by the more restrictively configured MTAs\r\n2. Packet capture of an actual Send-MailMessage session showing that the hostname passed by EHLO to the receiving MTA is the NetBIOS name, even if there is a primary DNS suffix configured on the machine (see first screenshot also).\r\n3. Packet capture of an actual failed SMTP conversation invoking a malformed hostname passed by EHLO, using Send-MailMessage, to the receiving MTA.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZoltan\r\n\r\n![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47029823/200192334-9ea74d96-9cba-4671-a412-2e47ce5a9add.png)\r\n![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47029823/200192335-be493ecd-90dd-4131-a7af-0dc38cec40a6.png)\r\n![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47029823/200192336-897436fc-1d42-4635-9300-dfb7f88c1207.png)\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo-powershell-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/send-mailmessage\">Send-MailMessage (Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility) - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>The Send-MailMessage cmdlet sends an email message from within PowerShell.

We also continue to ship `Send-MailMessage` for compatibility reasons for existing scripts.  It looks like there are at least 3 modules on PowerShellGallery already using MailKit https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages?q=mailkit.
