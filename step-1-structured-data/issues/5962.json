  "body": "If I want to delete multiple files with one invocation, I have to write:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\ndel file1,file2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's so easy to forget the comma because you don't need it with any other shell.\r\n\r\nI think adding this will require adding a new parameter that to accept `ValueFromRemainingArguments`, so the parameters will look a little weird, changing the `Path` parameter would break cases where an array was passed because the array gets converted to string.",
