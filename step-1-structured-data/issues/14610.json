  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently, users of `Invoke-WebRequest` do not know how much they have downloaded because a big Byte number gets displayed and due to the digits not being mono-spaced, I cannot even attempt to count digits whilst the number changes every second. Also, I have no progress bar to tell me how much it needs to download.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n[ByteSize](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Bytesize) is a small (14KB) library to better display human readable file sizes but as the problem is quite simple, it was decided to not introduce a dependency but rather just hand-code it instead. Because PowerShell treats `1 KB` as 1024, it should probably use 1024 as the base for KB, MB, etc.\r\n\r\nI suggest to have one significant digit after after the comma starting with KB and increase the number of significant digits by 1 for MB, GB, etc.\r\n\r\nPR here: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14611",

A progress bar would be nice, but I would be content with some human-readable \"bytes downloaded\" display.  \"bytes\" is just not a human-readable unit of measure when you are talking about MB-GB file sizes.  At least not for this human.\r\n\r\nSo this is me piling on.  Yes, please implement this request.",
