  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nIn PR [#10587](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/10587/files) the `Add-Type` cmdlet was changed to search for the `ref` directory under the directory of the executing assembly. This was done to support hosted PowerShell environments that were using the `Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK` NuGet.\r\n\r\nIn the AWS's Lambda (serverless) service this change doesn't work because the executing assembly is in a different directory then the provided PowerShell Lambda function. When users attempt to use the `Add-Type` cmdlet the ref assemblies are not found because the executing assembly is in `/var/runtime` but the PowerShell Lambda function along with the `ref` directory or extracting in the `/var/task` directory.   \n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nIf there was an environment variable like `PS_REF_DIRECTORY` that pointed to the ref directory our AWS tooling could ensure this environment variable would be set during deployment.",
