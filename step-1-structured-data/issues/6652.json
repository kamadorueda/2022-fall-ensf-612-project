  "body": "#### Meta-issue to track work on improving the experience of PowerShell class usage as much as possible.\r\n\r\n## Note on By-Design Behaviours\r\n\r\nPowerShell classes currently are a bit finnicky. Some of this is a necessary pain because of the design constraints behind classes.\r\n\r\nClasses are currently implemented as compiling to .NET IL so that we can take advantage of the .NET object model. Not doing this would mean us reinventing (and having to maintain) the wheel on essentially all object-oriented features available in .NET (or anywhere else) and paying a high runtime overhead on shimming compatibility with the .NET object model (e.g. faking inheritance from .NET classes).\r\n\r\nInstead, we compile PowerShell classes to dynamic assemblies and bake in calls to PowerShell in the generated IL. To do this at runtime would mean either breaking dynamic- and module-scoped behaviours in classes, or emitting a new dynamic assembly every time we hit a class definition (and since PowerShell's highest compilation unit is the scriptblock, and scriptblocks are permitted in for-loops, the performance penalty here could be extreme). (I'm still a bit hazy on the details about the mechanisms here, especially in terms of why caching is made impossible by module scope or in comparison to `Add-Type`, but @daxian-dbw or @lzybkr will be able to add to/correct me).\r\n\r\nThe need to compile classes at parse-time means the types required to define a class (in IL) must also be known at parse-time. The module-scoping issue means that a `using module` statement is required to import classes from modules (@daxian-dbw might like to add information here about the specifics governing this need), or by exporting class usage in PowerShell functions (classes having a sort of module-private behaviour).\r\n\r\n## Issues to Improve\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a few improvements possible to PowerShell classes that might not run up against the design constraints given above. Below is a list of open issues for classes in PowerShell.\r\n\r\n### Classes in modules\r\n- [ ] #2449 Exporting classes in PS modules consistently.\r\n- [ ] #2505 Classes in nested modules are not updated by `Import-Module -Force`.\r\n- [ ] #2962 Using `ScriptsToProcess` with `using module` stops classes from being imported\r\n- [ ] #2964 `using module` imports nested module classes in a script but not interactively.\r\n- [ ] #4112 `using module` doesn't load classes when `FunctionToExport` or `CmdletToExport` are specified in the `.psd1`\r\n- [ ] #4114 `using module` does not find classes in nested modules.\r\n- [ ] #4713 PS classes cannot invoke non-exported functions from their module (possibly a `New-Module` problem).\r\n- [ ] #6293 Making PS classes exportable module members.\r\n\r\n### Type errors\r\n- [ ] #1762 Custom attributes can't be defined and used in the same PS module\r\n- [x] ~~#2074 Types not available at parse-time used in PS class bodies cause parse errors. @daxian-dbw noted that we need some types at parse-time (such as method return type) to generate the IL, but type resolution inside method/constructor scriptblocks may not be needed and be more appropriate at runtime.~~ Noted as by design.\r\n- [ ] #3641 Type availability at parse-time. Need to implement the metadata reader (#6653).\r\n- [ ] See also: [PSScriptAnalyzer #850](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/issues/850)\r\n\r\n### Other bugs\r\n- [ ] #2224 Some class errors occur at runtime when they can be detected at parse-time. (We may want to loosen the error-checking behaviour here if it makes sense to do so).\r\n- [ ] #2963 `New-Object` does not work for PS classes as it does for .NET classes.\r\n- [ ] #5337 PS Classes in collectible assemblies cause XML serialisation problems.\r\n- [x] #7622 `protected internal` override doesn't work (program diverges on method call).\r\n- [ ] #8235 Properties and methods with the same name are permitted in a declaration, but attempting to call the method results in an error that no such method exists.\r\n\r\n### New feature requests\r\n- [ ] #2223 Interface declarations\r\n- [ ] #2485 Validation attributes for PS classes\r\n- [ ] #2876 `static extern` methods and struct definition in PowerShell\r\n- [ ] #5099 Static class member imports\r\n- [ ] #6418 Other proposed class extensions.\r\n- [x] #8028 Support `enum` types other than `Int32`\r\n\r\nA couple of other resources on these issues:\r\n- @devblackops' talk on issues with PS classes: [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1DpPU_xxBc&list=PLfeA8kIs7CocGXuezOoYtLRdnK9S_Mq3e), [code](https://github.com/devblackops/pssummit2018-classes).\r\n- The SAPIEN page on the `using` statement: [here](https://info.sapien.com/index.php/scripting/scripting-classes/import-powershell-classes-from-modules).",

      "body": "Forgive some ignorance on my part, but looking at the number of issues and the complications that exist in classes in PowerShell today, I can't help but feel this is a design problem rather than a collection of issues/bugs to be addressed.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it make more sense and be much easier if:\r\n\r\n* PowerShell had a new module type specifically for class definitions, called something like class module that could only include class definitions, with a psx1 file extension; nothing else would be allowed in these files (no functions, variables, command invocations, etc.)\r\n* `Import-Module` automatically recognized psx1 files defined in `RootModule`, or class modules included in `NestedModules`, or `RequiredModules` fields in a module manifest, as well as psx1 modules that don't have a manifest at all, and loaded the types defined in those psx1 files accordingly (`RequiredModules` first, then `NestedModules`, then `RootModule`, so that you can derive from other types in other modules)\r\n* PowerShell automatically identified classes derived from `PSCmdlet` and added them to the current session without the extra work that is being done [here](https://www.indented.co.uk/cmdlets-without-a-dll/).\r\n* PowerShell automatically exported classes that are associated with cmdlets that are exported from a module.\r\n* PowerShell supported `ClassesToExport` in module manifests to identify types in modules so that implicit loading could still work, even with classes.\r\n* `Export-ModuleMember` had a `-Class` parameter to explicitly identify which classes you want to export\r\n\r\nOne of the drivers behind this approach is that it would do away with the need for `using` for modules containing classes, and supports `#requires`, `NestedModules`, `RequiredModules`, which makes installing modules from the PowerShell Gallery work as expected, and everything else that people already do with `Import-Module` today. Having both `using` and `Import-Module` is confusing and already requires a lot of re-thinking when it comes to how you set up modules to properly load classes. It also facilitates defining an equivalent of binary modules from within PowerShell itself.\r\n\r\nThere are more thoughts behind this, but I've shared enough to see what others think for now.",

With that approach, the last three bullets wouldn't be necessary -- classes would just be loaded and available once a module was imported.",

In a new module type we could have strict functions, and these functions could even be compiled like cmdlets, convert parameters to properties, etc. This isn't exactly easy, but I think it's fairly mechanical.",
