It would be nice if the VerbosePreference of the Invoke-Command Cmdlet would be set automatically in the executed scriptblock.\r\n\r\n```Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {Write-Verbose \"Hello World\"} -Verbose```\r\n\r\n```Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {[CmdletBinding()]Param() Write-Verbose \"Hello World\"} -Verbose```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nI would expect in both cases that the VerbosePreference gets applied automatically \r\n```VERBOSE: Hello World```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nNo verbose output.\r\nOne has to pass and set it manually to get it working:\r\n``` Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {[CmdletBinding()]Param($VerbosePreference) Write-Verbose \"Hello World\"} -Verbose -ArgumentList ('Continue')```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-beta\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\r\nCLRVersion\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-beta.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.15063\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@pcgeek86 My impression was that with the general usage of ```-Verbose``` is that one either gets no verbose output or everything. For example consider when calling function A that calls function B internally, the ```VerbosePreference``` propagates from A to B by default without doing anything. That's why I thought that this would be the more common and intuitive default and in the special case if one really wanted the Verbose output from ```Invoke-Command``` only but not the ```ScriptBlock``` one could still pass the desired ```VerbosePreference``` to the ```ScriptBlock``` as ```Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock {[CmdletBinding()]Param($VerbosePreference) Write-Verbose \"Hello World\"} -Verbose -ArgumentList ('SilentlyContinue')```\r\nThis is certainly a more philosophical discussion but to me it would make the behaviour more consistent and intuitive. Should the outcome of this discussion be a change, then one would most certainly also need to include other preferences such as ```InformationPreference``` (and maybe even the ```WhatIfPreference```).",

      "body": "I too ran into the same problem with not understanding why my verbose statements within an `Invoke-Command` were not outputting. It is confusing and adds extra work.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, the expectation with `Invoke-Command` is to execute all statements within the script block remotely. Output is already routing back to the local terminal session to be displayed. So when you see `Write-Verbose` statements, and `-Verbose` set on the Cmdlet, you expect it to show up. \r\n\r\nAs for the conflict with `Invoke-Command` having it's own Verbose statements, as far as I can tell, there are none. If there were, it wouldn't be an issue with `-Debug` or `-Verbose` showing the connection activities mixed in with my Verbose. It could actually help if something were broken in remoting.",

      "body": "I think having verbose output for both the `Invoke-Command` cmdlet and the command itself is sane default behaviour. If someone wants verbosity only from `Invoke-Command` itself and not the command, they can set `$VerbosePreference` or pass the `-Verbose:$false` switch to the commands explicitly in the command scope or by using a similar workaround [explained above](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4040#issuecomment-309285151).",
