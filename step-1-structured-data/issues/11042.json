  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR provides new behavior, as experimental feature `PSUnixFileStat`, to include data from the Unix stat API in the output of the file system provider to facilitate a more Unix-like file listing. It adds a new note property in the filesystem provider named `UnixStat` which includes a common expression of the `stat(2)` API from the underlying Unix type system. The native calls in the `powershell-native` assembly have created \r\n\r\nThe output from `Get-ChildItem` should look something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> dir | select -first 4 -skip 5\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: /Users/jimtru/src/github/forks/JamesWTruher/PowerShell-1\r\n\r\nUnixMode   User             Group                 LastWriteTime           Size Name\r\n--------   ----             -----                 -------------           ---- ----\r\ndrwxr-xr-x jimtru           staff              10/23/2019 13:16            416 test\r\ndrwxr-xr-x jimtru           staff               11/8/2019 10:37            896 tools\r\n-rw-r--r-- jimtru           staff               11/8/2019 10:37         112858 build.psm1\r\n-rw-r--r-- jimtru           staff               11/8/2019 10:37         201297 CHANGELOG.md\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe username and groupname are retrieved at the time of formatting to reduce the number of PInvokes required.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nI've been somewhat frustrated with viewing the output of `Get-ChildItem` since it's different from `/bin/ls -l` output. This is an attempt to improve the experience with regard to the file system provider when running on a non-Windows platforms.\r\n\r\nThe old format is still available by selecting the `children` view with format-table:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> dir | select -skip 5 -first 4 | ft -view children\r\n\r\n    Directory: /Users/jimtru/src/github/forks/JamesWTruher/PowerShell-1\r\n\r\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                 -------------         ------ ----\r\nd----          10/23/2019  1:16 PM                test\r\nd----           11/8/2019 10:37 AM                tools\r\n-----           11/8/2019 10:37 AM         112858 build.psm1\r\n-----           11/8/2019 10:37 AM         201297 CHANGELOG.md\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
