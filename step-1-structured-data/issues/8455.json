  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently, when using `Format-Table` and the number of rows is more than the screen buffer,\r\nthe table header is scrolled off the screen and the rows don't have context on the meaning\r\nof each cell.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly troublesome for users using a screen reader as it is likely they will lose context of the meaning of the different columns after a moderate number of rows is read.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nAdd a new switch called `-RepeatHeader` (suggestions welcome on naming) where after every screen buffer full of rows, the table header is repeated.  Note that because we cannot detect definitively that the output isn't being paged (where this is most useful), it is up to the user to pipe the output to a pager.\r\n",
