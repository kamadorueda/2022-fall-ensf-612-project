There is a decent work around involving adding a font to the console as well as confirmation that work to fix this in the console is underway here https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL/issues/75#issuecomment-391155429",

      "body": "@cawoodm Sorry to reply to such a old thread but this might be something others find useful too. For Powershell 5.1 to print emoji's that are hard coded into the text file e.g\r\n```powershell\r\necho \"Done \u2705\"\r\n```\r\nyou have to save the file with `UTF8-BOM` encoding. For some reason it doesn't pick up on the UTF8 unless it has the BOM whereas newer versions of PowerShell automatically detect any UTF8.\r\n\r\nHope this helps someone with the same problem I had.",
