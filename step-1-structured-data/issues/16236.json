Why is powershell still preventing this feature, contrasting with now all other microsoft programs ?\r\n\r\nAs per my research, there has been no public explanation for it and not a single visible issue deals with the topic here.\r\n\r\nPlease explain this decision and consider reverting the normal behavior.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\n- Open a powershell window.\r\n- Hit Alt+F4\r\n- Powershell window should close.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\n- Open a powershell window.\r\n- Hit Alt+F4\r\n- Powershell window doesn't close.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

Here's the relevant info from the docs:\r\n\r\n> CTRL+C is processed by the system and is not placed in the input buffer. If the input buffer is being read by\u00a0ReadFile\u00a0or\u00a0ReadConsole, ***other control keys are processed by the system and are not returned in the\u00a0ReadFile\u00a0or\u00a0ReadConsole\u00a0buffer***.\r\n\r\nMaybe the docs for `Console.TreatControlCAsInput` should reflect that though as it currently does not.",
