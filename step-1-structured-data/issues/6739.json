Seems like maybe we should use the testdrive for the filesystem path as something predictable and can be used on all systems. The Windows folder isn't anything special here with regards to tab completion.\r\n\r\nFrom @iSazonov:\r\n> Formatting doesn't work in the test at all and we should remove it.",
