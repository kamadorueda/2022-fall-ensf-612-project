When built on Mac, it errors out https://github.com/christophwille/ilspy-pscore/issues/1\r\n```\r\nImport-Module .\\ICSharpCode.Decompiler.PSCore.dll\r\n$asm = Get-Assembly .\\ICSharpCode.Decompiler.Extensions.dll\r\n$asm\r\n```\r\nThose lines work. When I call eg \r\n```\r\n$classes = Get-DecompiledTypes $asm -Types class\r\n```\r\nit errors out \r\n\r\n```\r\nPS /Users/christophw/GitWorkspace/ilspy-pscore/src/ICSharpCode.Decompiler.PSCore/bin/Debug/netstandard2.0> $classes = Get-DecompiledTypes $asm -Types class\r\nGet-DecompiledTypes : Specified argument was out of the range of valid values.\r\nAt line:1 char:12\r\n+ $classes = Get-DecompiledTypes $asm -Types class\r\n+            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Get-DecompiledTypes], ArgumentOutOfRangeException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException,ICSharpCode.Decompiler.PSCore.GetDecompiledTypesCmdlet\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe first cmdlet loads only a 461 compiled assembly (Mono Cecil). All other cmdlets load icsharpcode.decompiler.dll which is a netstandard2 assembly. Given the notes in the aforementioned guideline on writing a binary module (netstandard.dll issues on Windows) - is there a similar issue on Mac?",

      "body": "That netstandard.dll problem is a problem for anything using full .net prior to the new 4.7.1 which just shipped in the Windows 10 October 2017 update (aka \"Fall Creators Update\").\r\n\r\nThat is, if you're using Mono (or .Net Framework prior to 4.7.1) it's not fully .Net Standard 2 compliant, and you're going to have to ship that assembly.  I'm not sure about Mono's adoption of .Net Standard -- so I'm not sure if that works at all anyway.",
