  "body": "A couple of days ago, the newest version of the PowerShell Core (Alpha 11) was released on GitHub. Unfortunately, the Docker container image, hosted on the Docker Hub, under the `microsoft/powershell` repository, has not been updated. In the screenshot below, you'll notice that the newest PowerShell Docker container image is Alpha 10, not Alpha 11.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/466713/19537733/4a96b640-960e-11e6-80c4-08bc407af703.png)\n\nFurthermore, the Docker Hub shows that the latest `microsoft/powershell` container image was built 8 days ago, which is six days prior to the GitHub release of PowerShell Core Alpha 11.\n\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/466713/19537758/62b19f42-960e-11e6-9492-08e0d476b23c.png)\n\nPlease make sure that the newest Docker container image is available for each public release of PowerShell Core going forward. @andschwa \n\nCheers,\n**Trevor Sullivan**\nDocker Captain\nMicrosoft MVP: Cloud & Data Center Management\nhttps://trevorsullivan.net\nhttps://twitter.com/pcgeek86\n",
