Recent version of Windows 10 (1803/1809) come with OpenSSH Client but you have to enable it as an \"optional feature\".  If you have an older version of Windows 10, grab Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org) and install with `choco install openssh`.",

Of course, if you don't have PowerShell Core installed you will need to install it from this repo.",

      "body": "thanks a 0xF4240, @rkeithhill, for the quick response. and yes, that (obscure <g/>) switch worked. at least I now have more cool PS capabilities like SSH.\r\n\r\nhowever, i get a **Permission denied** error when i enter azureuser@[my vm dns] and enter the azureuser password I just set up in Azure Portal. Does it matter that azureuser has both a password and a public key?\r\nprobably not because i can successfully use those credentials in VS Code using the **SSH** terminal.\r\n\r\nI should note that earlier today I upgraded PS itself from v5.1 to v6.1, and i received the same permission denied error using the same credentials I just entered in VS Code running PS 6.1. that consistency between PS and VS Code is the only thing that's not surprising about all this.\r\n\r\nso, what's the difference between SSH and PSIntegrated?\r\n\r\nbtw, here's the complete error:\r\n```\r\nEnter-PSSession : The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has ended with error message: Permission denied, please try again.\r\nPermission denied, please try again..\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Enter-PSSession -HostName [my dns].eastus.cloudapp.azure.com\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ResourceUnavailable: (:) [Enter-PSSession], PSRemotingTransportException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSRemotingDataStructureException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.EnterPSSessionCommand\r\n```",
