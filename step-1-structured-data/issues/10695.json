  "body": "Similar to https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7781 but this time around inside a .NET Core 3.0 Preview 7 Docker Image.\r\n\r\nI first failed with the default-generated dockerfile (Debian), so I switched to Ubuntu Bionic. However, the error message was the same (WSMan missing). Initially I tried (again) to add all various NuGets (please see https://github.com/christophwille/pscore-playground/blob/master/NetCorePSCore-Simple/NetCore.RemotePS/NetCore.RemotePS.csproj#L10)\r\n\r\nMy current nasty workaround is to install full PowerShell Core into the image via RUN https://github.com/christophwille/pscore-playground/blob/master/NetCorePSCore-Simple/NetCore.SimpleWebApi/Dockerfile#L19 - then WSMan \"behaves\" properly.\r\n\r\nQuestion: what would be the minimum to install via RUN to get rid of the error? (I think some of the dependencies of powershell might do?) Or is there some other way to get PS to \"find\" WSMan in the image?",
