      "body": "You're welcome. I already have a branch [here](https://github.com/bergmeister/PowerShell/tree/installerBuildCleanup) to simplify some of the msi build code after the release. If I understand correctly then the current behaviour in terms of product code and upgrade code is OK, i.e. it is correct to always auto-generate a new GUID because otherwise you get an error of the kind 'another version of this product is already installed' but the upgrade code must remain constant (per architecture) if you want to allow direct upgrades, which you definitely want for patch version updates and proabably also for minor version updates.\r\nThe official WiX documentation about it is [here](http://wixtoolset.org/documentation/manual/v3/howtos/updates/major_upgrade.html) and seems to confirm this but it also says\r\n> Test upgrade scenarios before you ship version 1\r\n  ",
