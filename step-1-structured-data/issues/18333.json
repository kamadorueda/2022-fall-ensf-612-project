  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis may be a windows problem. But I need your help to figure it out and can't reproduce on Windows Powershell\r\n\r\nJust run: \r\n```\r\n$c = Get-credential\r\nStart-Process cmd -Credential $c\r\n```\r\nor one liner `Start-Process cmd -Credential $get-credential``\r\n(I am using credentials of a local user from my machine. Not domain-joined.)\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nA new window opens, I can write several lines in the new window, running as another user.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nA new window opens, I can write one line and press enter. Then the input on that window HANGS. Keypresses are not handled anymore.\r\n\r\nIf I switch focus back to the parent window, the input missing input is processed. If you keep playing, the input on the parent caller window may hang its processing too.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n-> Windows 11 Pro 21H2 22000.1098\r\n-> Fails using Pwsh 7.2.6, unable to reproduce on Windows Powershell\r\n-> Can reproduce with both legacy ConHost.exe or Windows Terminal Preview (1.16.2642.0)\r\n-> Also happens on a second computer.\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3901474/196816752-1bd7a2ba-ee48-49d4-9740-5f7df94bd327.png)\r\n\r\nThe second line, marked by the arrow, does not appear until you switch focus back and forth between both windows.",
