  "body": "I followed the direction located [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-6#installation-via-package-repository-preferred---fedora-27-fedora-28).\r\n\r\nAnd I receive the following error:\r\n\r\nsudo dnf install powershell\r\nRepository packages-microsoft-com-prod is listed more than once in the configuration\r\nLast metadata expiration check: 0:05:34 ago on Tue 12 Feb 2019 08:19:37 PM EST.\r\nNo match for argument: powershell\r\nError: Unable to find a match\r\n\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start with a fresh install of Fedora 29\r\n2. Install Microsoft .NET Core following directions [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/linux-package-manager/fedora28/sdk-current).\r\n3. Follow directions to install PowerShell Core from [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-6#installation-via-package-repository-preferred---fedora-27-fedora-28)\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThat there wouldn't be a naming conflict that prevents searching the repository to find the PowerShell package.\r\n\r\n# Actual Issue\r\n\r\nBoth the .NET Core package repository and the PowerShell package repository for Fedora both use the same package name which cause the conflict.\r\n\r\n## .NET Core\r\n[packages-microsoft-com-prod]\r\nname=packages-microsoft-com-prod\r\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/fedora/27/prod/\r\nenabled=1\r\ngpgcheck=1\r\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc\r\n\r\n## PowerShell\r\n[packages-microsoft-com-prod]\r\nname=packages-microsoft-com-prod\r\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/7/prod/\r\nenabled=1\r\ngpgcheck=1\r\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc\r\n\r\n# Workaround\r\n\r\nI just opened the *microsoft.prod* repo file that was created and edited it to change the repository name.\r\n\r\n[packages-microsoft-com-pwsh]\r\nname=packages-microsoft-com-pwsh\r\nbaseurl=https://packages.microsoft.com/rhel/7/prod/\r\nenabled=1\r\ngpgcheck=1\r\ngpgkey=https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc\r\n\r\n# Actual Resolution\r\n\r\nEither change the name of one of the package files or create a single repo that all Microsoft packages can be obtained.",
