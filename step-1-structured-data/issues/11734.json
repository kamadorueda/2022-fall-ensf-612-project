  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThe way that ANSI formatting strings are configured is different between the PSReadlineOptions and MarkdownOptions cmdlets.\r\n\r\nPSReadline requires that you include the escape character (`` `e ``) in the string. The MarkdownOptions cmdlet omit the escape character and throw an error if you try to include it (exception - see #11733). \r\n\r\nThe PSReadline pattern this the way most people think about defining these escape sequences and predate the Markdown cmdlets.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThis would be a breaking change but would be more consistent with existing patterns in PowerShell and decades of historical usage by ANSI artists.",
