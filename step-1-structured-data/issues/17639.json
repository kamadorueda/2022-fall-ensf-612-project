The on screen results look correct, but only when written out to the file are extra characters added to the header row.\r\n\r\nIn these examples below, I used `Set-Content` but the same error happens if you use `Out-File`, `Add-Content` or `Set-Content`.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nsee screenshot\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nsee screenshot\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nThere is no error\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.25151\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741612/177586337-f15e90f8-2bf2-430b-98d8-1c00fd5aec97.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7741612/177587135-af8bdbd4-b326-4ac6-ba5a-df89da4cf89a.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
