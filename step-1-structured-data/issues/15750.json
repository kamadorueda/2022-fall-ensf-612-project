      "body": "Finally found the problem. PowerShell 7 can't work with relative paths when creating junctions on directories. However PS5 can. So to fix it, you must provide always a full path. So with a full path works with PS 5 and PS 7, and you can use `Target` or `Value` both work.\r\n\r\nEither way it works now. Remember to run powershell as admin which can be required:\r\n````\r\nNew-Item -ItemType Junction -Path 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam' -Value  (Get-Item 'Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\').FullName\r\nNew-Item -ItemType Junction -Path 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam' -Target (Get-Item 'Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\').FullName\r\n````",
