That is, on Windows path `/` (`\\`)  is _drive_-relative, and converting it to an absolute path based on the state of the session (current location) is not `Split-Path`'s mandate. In other words: it would make more sense to me if `\\` were returned on Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This is presumably why both Unix and Windows accept such duplicated path separators.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Conversely, if we assume that the first `\\` / `/` in a path is a path separator _only_, you can make the argument that the root directory name is the _empty string_ that _precedes that first separator_, in which case `Split-Path -Leaf C:\\` and `Split-Path -Leaf /` should return `''`.\r\n\r\nWhile this works well when _building_ paths (e.g., `'' + '/' + 'foo'` to construct `/foo`), it is inherently _ambiguous_ in other contexts, as `Split-Path -Parent /foo` and `Split-Path -Parent foo` would then yield the same result, for instance - the empty string.\r\n\r\nOn balance, conceiving of the root directory name as `\\` / `/` is the better choice.",

Which is why I use join-path and split-path extensively with the hopes, that it will just handle this for me on all platforms.\r\n\r\nfrom my personal standpoint, paths that start with a separator are just an indication for them to be absolute and thus relative to the root directory, which has no name. so I would agree to your first point.\r\neven the second part actually sounds fine to me.\r\npassing only a single path segment to split-path and retrieving no parent and the segment as leaf seems just logical.\r\nit basically means that an empty path '' just points to root. just as '/', '\\\\', 'C:' or 'X:\\\\'\r\n\r\nresolving such a path would then result in a 'C:\\\\' (based on the working directories drive) or '/'\r\n\r\nhowever, im not sure how I would handle a split-path on an 'C:\\\\'.

      "body": "Just a terminology quibble:\r\n\r\n> paths that start with a separator are just an indication for them to be _absolute_\r\n\r\n* On Window, they are _rooted_ (`[IO.Path]::IsPathRooted()` returns `$true`), but _not absolute_ (`[IO.Path]::IsPathFullyQualified()` returns `$false`)\r\n\r\n* On Unix, they are both rooted and absolute.\r\n\r\nUsing `Join-Path` and `Split-Path` is good practice: `Join-Path` avoids the `C:\\\\foo` problem (though `Split-Path` doesn't correct it).\r\n\r\nHowever, another reason not to treat `''` as the root directory is that `Join-Path '' foo` simply fails.\r\n\r\nAlso, as stated, if you made `Split-Path /foo -Parent` return `''` (even though on Unix it currently does, but that's a variation of the bug at hand), you couldn't distinguish it from `Split-Path foo -Parent` - at least not without introducing a serious breaking change (such as to return `.` in the latter case).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, for consistency, you'd have to then allow `Get-ChildItem ''` to list the _root_ directory, whereas it currently lists the _current_ one.\r\n\r\nIn short: It is generally problematic to refer to a _specific_ something (the root dir.) with nothing (the empty string), and using `\\`/ `/` as the name of the root dir. is the best compromise.\r\n\r\nAs for how `Split-Path C:\\ -<switch>` _should_ be handled:\r\n\r\n* `Split-Path C:\\ -Leaf`  on Windows and `Split-Path / -Leaf` on Unix should return the _name of the root dir_, and therefore `\\` an `/`, respectively\r\n\r\n    * On Windows, it currently returns `C:\\`, which strikes me as incorrect - but fixing it would be a breaking change.\r\n\r\n    * On Unix - which is the bug at hand - it returns `''` (which by the (to me ill-advised) logic of considering `''` the root dir.'s name would actually be correct). \r\n\r\n* `Split-Path C:\\ -Parent`  on Windows and `Split-Path / -Parent` on Unix  are tricky:\r\n\r\n   * The root directory by definition has no parent, and `[IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName()` indicates this by returning `$null` - as opposed to the `''` returned for something like `[IO.Path]::GetDirectoryName('foo')`\r\n\r\n   * This is too subtle a distinction for PowerShell, where `[string]` values usually do not contain`$null`:\r\n       * On Windows , `Split-Path C:\\ -Parent` currently returns `''` - changing that would be a breaking change.\r\n       * On Unix, `Split-Path / -Parent` is currently _broken_, as you reported in #14392, which is a duplicate of #10092; for consistency, absent a breaking change, it should also return `''`.\r\n\r\n      * The upshot is that if you call `Split-Path -Parent $path`  on an unknown path `$path` and get `''` back, you'll need further investigation (`[IO.Path]::IsPathRooted()`) to infer whether `$path` refers to a root dir. (with or without a drive spec.) or is a mere file or directory name such as `foo`.\r\n        * Note that `Split-Path -IsAbsolute` isn't suitable for this distinction, because `Split-Path \\ -IsAbsolute` is `$false` on Windows.\r\n        * As an aside: It is `Test-Path` that should have this switch - it never made sense on `Split-Path`. Better yet, `Test-Path` should support an enumeration-based `-PathForm` / `-Form` parameter that allows testing for specific path forms (absolute, relative, rooted, UNC) - see #14402\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
