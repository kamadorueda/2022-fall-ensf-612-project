  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTry entering a non-BMP character such as \ud800\udc00 into PowerShell. Then, press backspace.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt should delete the entire character.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIt deletes the low UTF-16 surrogate, leaving the high surrogate.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0\r\nOS                             Linux 5.6.8-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Wed Apr 29 19:05:17 UTC 2020\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Additional notes\r\n\r\nThis affects not just backspace, but cursor movement as well. When the character is pasted in, I see the character itself, but also additional replacement characters surrounding it. These don't seem to be noticed by PowerShell, as the command history just shows the character pasted in when I press the up arrow, although just as usual, it takes up two columns in the terminal instead of one. I have run into this issue both on Windows and on Linux, and the results were similar if not the same on both. My test environment here was Linux, with both my terminal and PowerShell using UTF-8 output (which I understand PowerShell transcodes from UTF-16).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/614548/81242825-22582300-8fdc-11ea-9b9f-7396b81c8e00.png)",
