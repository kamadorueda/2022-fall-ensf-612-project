  "body": "This is a follow-up issue of #3649 \r\nAfter refactoring PowerShell assembly load context, we actually don't need `Microsoft.PowerShell.CoreCLR.AssemblyLoadContext.dll` anymore -- the remaining logic/functionality of this dll should be moved to `System.Management.Automation.dll` (`S.M.A.dll` depends on `AssemblyLoadContext.dll` today).\r\nThis might affect DSC because the DSC host is still depending on `AssemblyLoadContext.dll`, so we should communicate with DSC team on this to make sure nothing breaks.\r\n\r\nTasks\r\n------\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove `Microsoft.PowerShell.CoreCLR.AssemblyExtensions.LoadFrom(string assemblyPath)` once the PackageManagement module is migrated to .NET Core 2.0.\r\n- [x] Removing `Microsoft.PowerShell.CoreCLR.AssemblyLoadContext.dll` completely.",
