  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Write a command supporting an `ArgumentCompleter` on one of the parameters\r\n2. Test the completer by tabbing a parameter value on the command line and note that it works.\r\n3. Invoke the cmdlet without parameters on the command line such that you are prompted for input.\r\n4. Attempt to tab-complete the parameter that supports the completer.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPowerShell tab-completes the parameter.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPowerShell does nothing.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n\u001b[32;1mName                           Value\u001b[0m\r\n\u001b[32;1m----                           -----\u001b[0m\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Darwin 21.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 21.2.0: Sun \u2026\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "This is expected. \r\n\r\nWhen a mandatory parameter is omitted the fall back is to use `$host.UI.ReadLine`  or `$host.UI.ReadLineAsSecureString`  (as in `Read-Host`) to prompt for user input. So it:\r\n* Doesn't treat \",\" as a separator between items and requires multiple items as separate inputs\r\n* Doesn't process Variables  - `$PsversionTable` will be the literal text starting with a `$` sign not the value of the variable\r\n* Doesn't need quotes where there are spaces and treats quotes and escape characters as literal text. \r\n* Doesn't have any of the functionality provided by the prompt (and in modern versions by PS Readline).  So  `[ctrl]`+`r`  is not search-history but inserts `^R\" \r\n* Doesn't add to the search history\r\n\r\n ",
