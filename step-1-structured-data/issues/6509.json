  "body": "_Update_: @kvprasoon  suggests more generally to **support property _paths_ in cmdlets that accept property _names_**, typically via parameter `-Property`, such as `Select-Object` and  `Compare-Object`.\r\n\r\nPSv3 introduced two simplified syntax forms that, in simple scenarios, allow use of _parameters_ (i.e., argument mode) rather than _script blocks_ for a cleaner, less \"noisy\" experience:\r\n\r\n_Operation statements_ for `ForEach-Object`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Equivalent to: ... | ForEach-Object { $_.one }\r\n[pscustomobject] @{ one = 1 } | ForEach-Object one  # -> 1\r\n\r\n# Equivalent to: 1 | ForEach-Object { $_.Equals(1) }\r\n1 | ForEach-Object Equals 1    # -> $True\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Comparison statements_ for `Where-Object`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Equivalent to: ... | Where-Object { $_.one -eq 1 }\r\n[pscustomobject] @{ one = 1 } | Where-Object one -eq 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, the simplified syntax does'nt work for _nested_ member access, e.g., for accessing `one.two` in `[pscustomobject] @{ one = [pscustomobject] @{ two = 2 } }` - see below.\r\n\r\nNote that, by contrast, analogous nested access _does_ work in general in \"naked\" expression-based arguments:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$obj = [pscustomobject] @{ one = [pscustomobject] @{ two = 2 } }\r\nWrite-Output $obj.one.two  # correctly yields 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nTherefore, nested instance-member access - both properties and methods - should be supported.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$obj = [pscustomobject] @{ one = [pscustomobject] @{ two = 2 } }\r\n\r\n$obj | ForEach-Object one.two\r\n'---'\r\n$obj | Where-Object one.two -eq 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n1\r\n---\r\n\r\none     \r\n---     \r\n@{two=2}\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n---\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, the nested member access results in `$null` output.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on macOS 10.13.3\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.15063.674 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@mklement0 Just out of curiosity, how do you see multiple levels of method calls working? Methods can take arguments which works for one level as in your example:\r\n```\r\n1 | ForEach-Object Equals 1 \r\n```\r\nby taking a single argument list. How would things work when you have more than one method taking arguments (multiple argument lists)?\r\n\r\n> analogous nested access does work in general in \"naked\" expression-based arguments:\r\n\r\nPlease be careful about mixing up language elements and command parameter behaviours. In the following:\r\n```\r\nPS[1] (220) > $m = \"y\"\r\nPS[1] (221) > @{m=1; y=2} | foreach m\r\n1\r\nPS[1] (222) > @{m=1; y=2} | foreach $m\r\n2\r\n```\r\nare the arguments `m` and `$m` mean very different things. (I worry about confusing the user when we have multiple features that appear similar but are very different e.g. the foreach statement and the foreach cmdlet.)\r\n\r\n",

BREAKS: trailing `()` not recognized.\r\n'bar' | ForEach-Object Trim()\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that you can currently already _get away_ with method syntax if there's _at least one argument_, because the parser ultimately sees `Trim 'r', 'a'` and `Trim('r', 'a')` as the same.\r\n(For the same reason, people get away with fake method syntax in widely used calls such as `New-Object foo('a', 2)`).\r\n\r\nI suppose another way of resolving this would be to disallow nested method calls altogether, but, given that they already work in the general, expression-based-argument scenario, my vote is to allow them.\r\n\r\nMy sense is that not too many people will run into them, however, given that _property_ access rather than method calling strikes me as the far more common use case.\r\n\r\n",
