  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUsing smart card credentials when PowerShell is running as a different user from the user currently logged in to Windows fails to fetch the certificate of Smart Card from the current user  certificate store[certmgr.msc]\r\n\r\nThe logged-in user account is different than the smart card account. \r\n\r\nSteps to repro:\r\n-Launch PS 5.1 or 7 as a different user[type 2 authentication] and use the Smart card to authenticate when prompted for Windows credential, enter the pin for PSC\r\n-connect to Azure AD or any module : for example Connect-AzureAD\r\n-Use the UPN of the AD account that is mapped to Smart card and proceed further. Prompted to select password or pin/smart card. When selecting the latter, the certificate fails to fetch from the current user store\r\n\r\nHowever, I can connect to Azure AD with the same PSC when PS is launched in elevated mode[run as Administrator] or local user account. The certificate object gets successfully detected and I get a prompt to enter Pin. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nSteps to repro:\r\n-Launch PS 5.1 or 7 as a different user[type 2 authentication] and use the Smart card to authenticate when prompted for Windows credential, enter the pin for PSC\r\n-connect to Azure AD or any module: for example Connect-AzureAD\r\n-Use the UPN of the AD account that is mapped to Smart card and proceed further. Prompted to select password or pin/smart card. When selecting the latter, the certificate fails to fetch from the current user store\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nOn selecting Certificate-based authentication, the auth prompt should fetch the certificate appropriate for the scenario and allow us to enter a pin to authenticate. In the reported scenario, the certificate request times out and throws an error No valid client certificate found\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNo valid client certificate found in the request. No valid certificates found in the user's certificate store. Please try again after closing and reopening the browser and choose a different authentication method.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nPS C:\\Users\\v-kajaye> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n[PS-Certificate Prompt failure.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/6940083/PS-Certificate.Prompt.failure.zip)\r\n",
