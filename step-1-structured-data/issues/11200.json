If you use backslashes (<kbd>\\\\</kbd>) it resolves relative to the script location instead.  I believe there's an issue for fixing it with forward slashes.\r\n\r\nQuick test:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> md ./folder/folder2\r\n'class MyClass { static [string] $MyProp = \"testing\" }' |\r\n    Out-File -Encoding default ./folder/folder2/ExternalClasses.psm1\r\n\r\n'using module .\\folder2\\ExternalClasses.psm1; [MyClass]::MyProp' |\r\n    Out-File -Encoding default ./folder/MainScript.ps1\r\n\r\n& .\\folder\\MainScript.ps1\r\n# testing\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwitch it to forward slashes in the using statement and it throws.  Just a bug though.\r\n",
