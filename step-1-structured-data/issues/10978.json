  "body": "When a function ends with error (both Non-terminating and Terminating), I expect that the `$?` set to `False` in the caller scope. But actually does not.\r\n\r\nI think this issue is related #3629 , but it is not only `Write-Error` but also other commands.\r\n\r\n**This is just my personal opinion:**\r\nRegardless of this issue, the behavior of `$?` variable is so indefinite that it cannot be trusted at all. It is ideal to re-implement the `$?` correctly, but if the PowerShell team thinks that it is difficult to make a breaking change, New features such as pipeline chain operators should be implemented in a way that does not depend on `$?`.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction function1 { \r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    Param()\r\n    #Non-Terminating Error\r\n    Get-Item -Path 'NoSuchItem'\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction1\r\n$?    # expected False, but True is actual\r\n\r\nfunction function2 { \r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    Param()\r\n    #Terminating Error (.NET exception)\r\n    [int]::Parse('foo')\r\n}\r\n\r\nfunction2\r\n$?    # expected False, but True is actual\r\n\r\n\r\n# This may be out of focus on this issue, but for reference...\r\nfunction2 -ErrorAction Stop\r\n$?    # False. It is expected, but why?\r\n```\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
