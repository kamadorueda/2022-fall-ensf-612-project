I am seeing the same behavior.\r\n\r\nHi, I am also facing the same problem where GA builds (from RC) is taking much time compare to beta build.\r\n\r\nTill beta 6.0.0_beta.9-1 build the responses were very fast from from windows to linux and vice versa but after RC and till latest build of power shell, It taking much time to connect to the system.\r\nin terms of data, where Beta was taking 6-10 sec to connect to system, the latest build is taking 1-2 minutes to connect the system.\r\n\r\nfrom beta to RC. i am not seeing much about remoting commit apart from inclusion of psrp packages. \r\nP.S: Separate Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 from psrp.windows nuget package.\r\n\r\nCan anybody help me to understand more about the issue like why GA is taking time.\r\n ",
