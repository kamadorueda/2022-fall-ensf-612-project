  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI read and followed https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-6 and installed PS Core 6 with `dotnet tool install --global PowerShell`. I can confirm that `C:\\Users\\MyUser\\.dotnet\\tools` is in my user's PATH. I can also launch it by typing \"pwsh\" in a `cmd.exe` or in the \"old\" powershell prompt. `Get-Command pwsh` (from the old PowerShell) returns `C:\\Users\\MyUser\\.dotnet\\tools\\pwsh.exe`.\r\n\r\nHowever, when typing \"pwsh\" into Start (the start menu - i.e. pressing the Windows key and then starting to type), it doesn't appear in the start menu - even after waiting. The only thing that appears is the web search and when I press Enter, Edge opens with Bing.\r\n\r\nI also rebooted my system, and it didn't help.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPS Core should launch, i.e. Start should recognise pwsh, like the documentation says it would.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSee above.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\necho $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
