  "body": "I have a script that collects a lot of data from remote machines in different time zones.  I serialize all of the data using `Export-CliXml`, and then deserialize the data using `Import-CliXml` to parse it into a SQL database.\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to convert the DateTime objects I collect into DateTimeOffset objects, in order to store the DateTime in the machine's local time.  Unfortunately, it looks like the offset information is lost during the deserialization.  I know I could get the content of the CliXml file and convert the string to a DateTimeOffset, but I'm wondering if there's any way to preserve the information when using `Import-CliXml`.  I know I could also use `Get-TimeZone` to get the offset information, but I'm wondering if there's a way I can do this without collecting it.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nExample: **Converting string from CliXml file to DateTimeOffset**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51245144/60029540-fe5f4d80-9666-11e9-9aae-638108af6bd3.png)\r\n\r\nExample: **Importing CliXml and converting to DateTimeOffset does not preserve TimeZone offset**\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/51245144/60029625-2058d000-9667-11e9-9815-83708fa4f74b.png)\r\n",

When I use `Import-CliXml` though, the offset is lost during the deserialization back to DateTime, and gets automatically converted to my machine's local time.  \r\n\r\nI sort of expected the answer to be \"get the timezone offset and calculate the local time\", but I was hoping there might be some way to preserve the offset during deserialization without needing to collect it.\r\n\r\n",
