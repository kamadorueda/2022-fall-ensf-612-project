  "body": "Partially fix #3923\r\n\r\nThe releasing documentation is updated to reflect the desired release steps and the order to do those steps. The contents are rearranged focusing on the `Release Steps` -- if a release step should be elaborated, a section can be created below to describe the step in details and an in-doc link can be used to connect the step to the section. For example, currently, there are sections about `build packages`, `create NuGet packages`, `create release tag` and `update hombrew formula`.\r\n\r\nThis is the initial draft of the change, waiting on comments to improve.\r\n\r\n@TravisEz13 I didn't change the [`Side-By-Side Design` part](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3938/files#diff-7b3a0a87ddfb890682f6856a8acbaa8fR83) about the packaging on Unix. Can you please do a pass over that paragraph to see if anything needs to be changed there?",
