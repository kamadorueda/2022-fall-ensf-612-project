  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI would like to have the ability to export class definitions in a module as a means to automatically expose access to it.  Something like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass MyClass{\r\n   $MyMember1\r\n   $MyMember2\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport-modulemember -Class MyClass\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe goal is to avoid having to pepper my scripts with explicit \"using <modulename>\" directives in my scripts/code\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
