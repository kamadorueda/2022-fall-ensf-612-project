  "body": "_**Note:** This issue has surfaced on my console, after my computer updated with the **Creator's Update**_\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n- Install https://github.com/nicolalamacchia/powerline-consolas/blob/master/consola.ttf\r\n- Set font to Consolas (not **BOLD**)\r\n- I do it by:\r\n    ```\r\n    item HKCU:\\Console\\%SystemRoot%_System32_WindowsPowerShell_v1.0_powershell.exe | Set-ItemProperty -Name FaceName -Value \"Consolas\"\r\n    ```\r\n- Then run:\r\n    ```\r\n    $c=[Char]57520;Write-Host \"Test${c}Test${c}${c}${c}a\"\r\n    ```\r\n- Now use your cursor to select some of them. I have the character selecting 2 cells at once! (Or at least seeming like 1 character is taking up 2 cells, which I don't think was even possible in the previous versions of PowerShell)\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n- All of these symbols are single-spaced, and when selected and printed should only take one cell, and not look like they have a *ghost space* after them.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n| After print: | On Selection: | On different Selection: |\r\n| --- | --- | --- |\r\n| ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5303018/25206963/4ed688ec-2539-11e7-82c2-f8df84310963.png) | ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5303018/25206970/6880a944-2539-11e7-8dd6-7a2271cbb053.png) | ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5303018/25206978/7a346824-2539-11e7-9e1c-8b512798f8fa.png) |\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n- Background: `Black`\r\n- Foreground: `DarkYellow` (which always looks white)\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.15063.138\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.15063.138\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Based on the repro, I would say this issue has nothing to do with PowerShell.\r\n\r\nI'm not installing the font, but I have another font (Fira Code) that renders those characters correctly, and I can't repro.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing the problem is either the font or conhost. You should try to narrow down where the problem is, e.g. try to repro in cmd (maybe write a C# program to print those characters).\r\n\r\nAlso try changing the font after the characters are on the screen, if selection works as expected with one font, but not your version of Consolas, I might suspect the font.\r\n\r\nIf you narrow it down to conhost, you can report it [here](https://github.com/microsoft/bashonwindows).",
