      "body": "@mklement0 has a very detailed discussion of this behaviour [here in a StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38308796) but the short version would be:\r\n\r\n- \"The implementation of -Include / -Exclude with Get-ChildItem is unintuitive and has pitfalls\"\r\n- The command to do what you want is `Get-Item c:\\* -Exclude windows` (rather than get-childitem).\r\n- The \"get-childitem -exclude option\" does filtering on *the path you give to it*, rather than the childitems it is about to output. You give it a path with a wildcard in it, it resolves the wildcard to a list of possibles, then includes/excludes from that set of wildcarded paths, then looks for childitems in the remaining set and outputs all of them. From this design it can't do what you ask. `Get-ChildItem -Path c:\\* -Exclude Windows` will get you the child items of all the folders in c:\\ excluding the childitems in c:\\windows, or one level too deep. Compare with `get-childitem c:\\ -Exclude \\` which gets you the child items of c:\\ excluding anything in c:\\ - i.e. nothing.\r\n- Even though it still seems like this should work for you, the SO answer says \"*In the special case of path C:\\ (Get-ChildItem -Path C:\\ -Exclude <any-pattern>), where arguably the last path component is the empty string, it seems that any exclusion pattern is considered a match, and no output is ever produced*\" - this may be a bug, but also may be a breaking change to fix it.\r\n\r\n(The `help get-childitem -online` text is not very clear on explaining this behaviour of -Exclude)",

Situationally, it still _happens to_ work as expected, as in @jszabo98's `get-childitem c:\\windows -directory -exclude winsxs` example: the `-Exclude` pattern doesn't exclude `c:\\windows` itself, so the child items _are_ considered, and `WinSxS` is properly excluded.\r\n\r\nThis counter-intuitive, but seemingly by-(unfortunate)-design behavior has previously been reported in #3304 (I previously got the above distinction wrong there as well, but have fixed it now).\r\n\r\nI've made that clearer in the SO answer, and I've added a link to this issue to highlight the outright _bug_ with _root_ paths that  @jszabo98 discovered here (which the SO answer described inadequately - fixed now).\r\n\r\n**To summarize the bug:**\r\n\r\nTargeting a _root_ directory with either `Get-ChildItem` or `Get-Item` in combination with either `-Include` or `-Exclude` - irrespective of the specific patterns passed - is broken, in the following scenarios:\r\n\r\n* On Windows _without_ a provider-qualified path: the command is unexpectedly a _quiet no-op_\r\n\r\n* On Unix-like platforms _without_ a provider-qualified and on Windows _with_  a provider-qualified path: the command breaks with statement-terminating error `cannot process argument because the value of argument \"path\" is not valid.`\r\n\r\nCuriously, the behavior is _not_ broken _with_  a provider-qualified path on _Unix_.\r\n\r\nHere are Pester tests:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nDescribe \"Get-[Child]Item -Include / -Exclude tests\" {\r\n\r\n  BeforeAll {\r\n\r\n    $rootPaths = '/', '\\' + ($IsWindows ? 'c:\\', 'c:/' : @())\r\n    $qualifiers = '', 'Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::'\r\n    $commands = @(\r\n      { Get-ChildItem $rootPath -Exclude NothingToExclude }\r\n      { Get-ChildItem $rootPath -Include * }\r\n      { Get-Item $rootPath -Exclude NothingToExclude }\r\n      { Get-Item $rootPath -Include * }\r\n    )\r\n    $testCases = foreach ($rootPath in $rootPaths) {\r\n      foreach ($qualifier in $qualifiers) {\r\n        foreach ($command in $commands) {\r\n          @{\r\n            Command = $command\r\n            RootPath = $qualifier + $rootPath\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  It \"Command { <Command> } works with root path '<RootPath>'\" -TestCases $testCases {\r\n    param($Command, $RootPath)\r\n\r\n    $(try { & $Command } catch { Write-Warning \"{ $Command } with root path '$RootPath' failed unexpectedly: $_\" }) | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty\r\n\r\n  }\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese tests revealed an unrelated bug on Windows, namely that `Get-Item Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::\\` and `Get-Item Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::/` by themselves don't work  (whereas `Get-ChildItem` does) - see #11660",
