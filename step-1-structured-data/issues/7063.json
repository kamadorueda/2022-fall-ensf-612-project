That kind of information should be present in the release notes for the RC/Preview release. \r\n\r\nThe 6.1.0-preview.3 release page provides links to deb packages and the installation of deb  packages is pretty straight forward. IMO, There should be a realistic expectation from technical users testing Preview and RC releases that live documentation will reflect the latest GA release, and not the RC and preview releases.\r\n\r\nAs the information relevant to this issue is [already present in the correct documentation branch](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/blob/release-ps61/reference/docs-conceptual/setup/Installing-PowerShell-Core-on-Linux.md#ubuntu-1804) in PowerShell-Docs I am closing this issue.",
