Second try and fourth try went smooth.\r\n\r\nThere are no problem with execution of following command:\r\n```powershell\r\n$Host\r\n$Host.UI\r\n$Host.UI.RawUI.Lengthinbuffercells('3')\r\n```\r\nor other public member of \"System.Management.Automation.Internal.Host.InternalHostRawUserInterface\" \r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRequire container (SQLPAL) environment provided by Resilliency team, however PowerShell script executed in it are as simple as I listed above.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.9200\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u00e0}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nFinished\r\n```\r\n",

(it's not straight forward to set up the environment).\r\n\r\nI tried pwsh -NonInteractive and it didn't help.",
