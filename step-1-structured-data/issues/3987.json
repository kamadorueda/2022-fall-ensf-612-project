  "body": "When _invoking_ a `Get-*` cmdlet, the `Get-` prefix is optional, because `Get` is the default verb; E.g., `Get-Content` can be invoked as `content`.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, both `Get-Command` and `Get-Help` (as well as the common `-?` parameter) are unaware of this; `Get-Command` _fails_ (unless there happens to be a different command with that exact name), and `Get-Help` / `-?` list all topics that _contain_ the name.\r\n\r\n_All three scenarios should treat a given command name the same._\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n'hi' > t.txt; content t.txt\r\n'---'\r\nGet-Command content | % Name\r\n'---'\r\nGet-Help content | % Name\r\n'---'\r\ncontent -? | % Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nhi\r\n---\r\nGet-Content\r\n---\r\nGet-Content\r\n---\r\nGet-Content\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nhi\r\n---\r\nGet-Command : The term 'content' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

Maybe instead of completely removing it, apply the lookup only if the command starts with e.g. `--` or some special character.\r\nI would otherwise vote to remove optional expensive actions that get invoked when the user does not intend/want/need to. Everytime I try to tab-complete stuff when the `AzureRM` module is loaded, I can take a sipp of coffee...\r\n  \r\n  ",
