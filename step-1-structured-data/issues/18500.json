Please understand.\r\n\r\n`releases/download/1.8.0(random)/IPBan-Windows-x64_1_8_0(random).zip`\r\n\r\nIn this case, what should I do.. Search through the command\r\nCan I download it?...\r\n\r\nIf I know it, I think it can be applied to various areas.\r\nI don't speak English, so I used Google Translate.\r\n\r\nthank you.\r\n\r\nOrganize my writing.\r\nMy goal is to get the latest version files that are currently released.\r\nthrough the command. That's my goal.\r\n:)\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nidea\r\nrandom address. It is marked with `???`.\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://test.com/dd/???/test*.zip`\r\n\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri -New` = Lets you select the highest number.\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri -New1~6`, from the highest file to 6 output.\r\n\r\n`-Old` the same. Measure from the bottom of the number. Alphabet is the same.\r\n`-Old 1~6` numbers can be set by yourself.\r\n\r\nInclude all url addresses like test*.zip dir command.\r\napplication `*test*.zip`\r\n\r\n`https://test.com/dd/[1-5,A-F]/test*.zip`\r\nOnly numbers from 1 to 5 are accepted. And if there is an alphabet after it, A to F are allowed.\r\n\r\nfor example\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://test.com/dd/1A2B3d3/test*.zip`\r\nThis address is verified as the correct address. let me bring\r\n\r\nApplications\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://test.com/dd/[1~5,A-F.1~5,A-F.1~5,A-F]/test*.zip`\r\nThe address is expressed by putting a dot in the middle.\r\n\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://test.com/dd/1A2B3d3.1A2B3d3.1A2B3d3/test*.zip`",

A lot of the time what has to happen is  GET  /SomePage ; process the result to find the latest version or URL for another version; then Get /FileYouReallyWant. \r\n\r\nIt would be easy enough to write for one target, but it doesn't generalize\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I actually didn't like the `dir` command or the `cmd Tree` command.\r\nThis is because it is a command to output everything in the target. However.\r\nI made it, and many people use it a lot.\r\n\r\nSo my thoughts. Try making it once.\r\nAnd that's what you try.\r\n\r\nAnd I would like to refine it and edit it.\r\n\r\nAnd in the case of a standard url, you can set the pattern by standardizing the settings.\r\nOnly under certain conditions.\r\n\r\nYou don't have to be perfect in the first place.\r\n\r\nBecause it is the first time I try and it is the first time I make it.\r\n\r\nLike math rules. A specific condition is entered by the user. if you find\r\n\r\nIt appears to be possible. If you think it's difficult\r\n\r\n'dir' is what I'm thinking\r\n\r\nIt is simply ignorantly applying the rule pattern of `dir` if there are technical limitations.\r\n\r\nServers and data also have specific patterns.\r\n\r\nAnd the slash is separated by `//`, but in the end, `\\\\` is in the form of a folder like a reverse slash.\r\n\r\nIt simply searches for it and outputs it according to the conditional expression.\r\n\r\nthere simply. The \"*\" wildcard inserts the difficult part of programming like a button easily and conveniently.\r\n\r\nI used google translator.\r\n\r\n",
