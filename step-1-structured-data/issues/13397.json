  "body": "<!--\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(get-culture).displayname\r\nEnglish (United Kingdom)\r\n\r\nget-date          \r\nTuesday, 11 August 2020 08:00:02\r\n\r\nget-date -format g \r\n11/08/2020 07:59\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo far so good\r\n```\r\n$dt = get-date\r\n\"$dt\"\r\n11/08/2020 07:59\r\n\r\n\"$(get-date)\"\r\n08/11/2020 07:59:50\r\n```\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nI would have expected that \r\n\r\n```none\r\n\"$(get-date)\"\r\n```\r\nWould produce a UK formatted date obj.  Especially as \r\n\r\n```\r\n\"$(get-culture)\" \r\nen-GB\r\n\r\n\"$(get-date -format g)\" \r\n11/08/2020 07:59\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe output seems to be producing a US output, despite the culture apparently being en-GB. Clearly given the the difference in output between \r\n```\r\n$dt =get-date\r\n\"$($dt)\"\r\n08/11/2020 08:16:21\r\n\"$($dt.ToString())\"\r\n11/08/2020 08:16:21\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is reason why there is a difference between the formatting? I'd expect the out put of \"$dt\" to be the ToString() output of $dt.  Instead I'm seeing \r\n```\r\n\"$(get-culture; get-date)\"\r\nen-GB 08/11/2020 08:30:49\r\n\"$(get-culture; (get-date).ToString())\"\r\nen-GB 11/08/2020 08:31:08\r\n```\r\nClearly there is some subtlety I'm musing - or a bug.  Probably the former, I know - I'd appreciate some pointers.\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0\r\nOS                             Linux 4.9.34-gentoo #1 SMP Sun Aug 13 00:47:40 BST 2017\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
