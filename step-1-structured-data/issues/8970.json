  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently, most PowerShell module aliases are defined in the PowerShell engine:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/5d54f1aa3871a826409496437e25856dc263ccc4/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InitialSessionState.cs#L4489-L4655\r\n\r\nThese are aliases of cmdlets exported by the bundled PowerShell modules, such as Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility, which only exports a single alias:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/5d54f1aa3871a826409496437e25856dc263ccc4/src/Modules/Windows/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility.psd1#L29\r\n\r\nWhile this is a legitimate concept (an alias of a cmdlet being defined outside the module that defines the cmdlet itself), it seems like an unneeded coupling to have the PowerShell engine define such aliases, especially when the modules themselves are (1) perfectly capable of exporting their own aliases and (2) ideally decoupled from the PowerShell engine entirely.\r\n\r\nI can imagine there might be some aliases that it still makes sense to define inside the engine, but is there any reason so many are?\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to get more than one result for `gmo Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility | % { $_.ExportedAliases.Values }`.",
