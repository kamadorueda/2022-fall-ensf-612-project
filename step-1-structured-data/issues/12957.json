Tool 'powershell' failed to install. \r\n\r\n`pwsh`\r\n\r\n The application to execute does not exist: 'C:\\Users\\XXX\\.dotnet\\tools\\.store\\powershell\\7.0.1\\powershell\\7.0.1\\tools\\netcoreapp3.1\\any\\Microsoft.PowerShell.GlobalTool.Shim.dll'. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPowershell should update or at least fail to update without breaking the existing system. It is now in a un-recoverable state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\ncan't run pwsh any more\r\n\r\nsystem is a Windows 10 x64 Pro v1909\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
