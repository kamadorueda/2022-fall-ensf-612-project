  "body": "When `Remove-Item` is used to remove a symbolic link in Windows, only the link itself is removed. The `-Force` switch is no longer required.\r\n\r\nIf the directory pointed to by the link has child items, the cmdlet no longer prompts the user to remove the child items---those child items are *not* removed. The `-Recurse` switch, if given, is ignored.\r\n\r\nThis brings `Remove-Item more in line with the behavior of the 'rm'` command on Unix.\r\n\r\nPartially fix #621",
