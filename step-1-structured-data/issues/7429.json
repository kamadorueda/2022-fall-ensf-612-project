Because in fact _still_ no one has responded to or triaged the UserVoice version of that bug report from 2016.\r\n\r\nSorry, I know this isn't an interesting engine problem like the Hashtable one, but it _is_ one that was discussed during the **OS Deployments using WinPE + PowerShell and WindowsImageTools** panel by David Jones at last year's PowerShell Summit and there doesn't seem to be any official acknowledgement that this issue exists.",
