  "body": "Wix toolset is part of the AppVeyor base image. The daily build did not generate a MSI since Wix toolset was not found.\r\nAppVeyor updated the Wix version in the base image and our checks failed.\r\nThe fix removes the hardcoded version from path. It also guards against multiple side-by-side versions.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
