      "body": "My concern is that this practically eliminates the ability to merge any more changes from Source Depot, and also makes diffing our changes from master to source-depot impractical. I do _love_ automatic refactoring, but am unsure if we want to pay these costs right now. Of course, this becomes more difficult to do once the repository goes open source (as it disturbs even more developers work-in-progress).\n",
