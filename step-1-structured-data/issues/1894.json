  "body": "The OSX build instructions have the following line:\n\n```\nbrew link --force openssl\n```\n\nThis is not recommended and, as of https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/597 is not possible, since it can create a header/library mismatch.  See that PR and https://langui.sh/2015/07/24/osx-clang-include-lib-search-paths/ for more information on the issue and the security implications.\n\nSo, a recommendation, and a question:\n- For bootstrapping PowerShell, instead of trying to link OpenSSL to `/usr/local`, you should instruct users to pass `$(brew --prefix)/opt/openssl` to the compiler.\n- Is the `.pkg` release of PowerShell build with a force-linked OpenSSL?  If so you should double-check that it's linked correctly.\n",
