  "body": "From what I can tell, this discrepancy has always existed, so there may be a good reason for it, but it deserves an explanation / documentation.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, where do the extra properties come from? They appear not to be part of the ETS type data as returned by `Get-TypeData System.IO.DirectoryInfo` (and there's also none for the parent type, `Get-TypeData System.IO.FileSystemInfo`).\r\n\r\nThe absence of the `.PSPath` property from the directly constructed `[System.IO.DirectoryInfo]` and `[System.IO.FileInfo]` instances  is especially problematic, because pipeline-binding to `-LiteralPath` parameters is based on it.\r\n\r\nThe types used are just an example; the same discrepancy exists for other types, such as `[datetime]::now` vs. `Get-Date`.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Construct  seemingly identical [System.IO.DirectoryInfo] instances\r\n([System.IO.DirectoryInfo] '/').psextended | Format-List\r\n'---'\r\n(Get-Item '/').psextended | Format-List\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::/\r\nPSParentPath  : \r\nPSChildName   : \r\nPSDrive       : /\r\nPSProvider    : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem\r\nPSIsContainer : True\r\nMode          : d-r---\r\nBaseName      : /\r\nTarget        : \r\nLinkType      : \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::/\r\nPSParentPath  : \r\nPSChildName   : \r\nPSDrive       : /\r\nPSProvider    : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem\r\nPSIsContainer : True\r\nMode          : d-r---\r\nBaseName      : /\r\nTarget        : \r\nLinkType      : \r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nMode     : d-r---\r\nBaseName : /\r\nTarget   : \r\nLinkType : \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPSPath        : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::/\r\nPSParentPath  : \r\nPSChildName   : \r\nPSDrive       : /\r\nPSProvider    : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem\r\nPSIsContainer : True\r\nMode          : d-r---\r\nBaseName      : /\r\nTarget        : \r\nLinkType      : \r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the `PS`-prefixed properties only exist on the instance output by `Get-Item`.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on macOS 10.12.5\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.15063.413 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT describes a current pattern, but it doesn't make it a good pattern.\r\n\r\nTo use the `Get-Process` example, I think `Get-Process -IncludeUserName` is a bit gross. `UserName` seems important enough that it should always be available on a `Process` object, and ETS was designed for just that scenario.\r\n\r\nIf I want the user name in the output, then I'd rather see `Get-Process | Format-Table -View ProcessWithUserName` or something like that.\r\n\r\nTo expand a bit on how we abuse ETS unnecessarily in the name of formatting, I'll point out an idea first introduced by @KirkMunro in [FormatPx](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/FormatPx/1.1.3.15).\r\n\r\nThe basic idea is that formatting directives are attached to an object without relying on the typename. This has the benefit of binding your formats in a script, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Get-Process\r\n{\r\n    # Use a very basic default format\r\n    [System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetProcesses() | Format-Table Id,ProcessName\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd use the function like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS> $x = Get-Process\r\nPS> $x[0].ProcessName\r\ncmd\r\nPS> $x\r\n\r\nId  ProcessName\r\n==  ===========\r\n11  cmd\r\n22  powershell\r\n\r\nPS> $x | Format-Table Id,SI,ProcessName\r\n\r\nId  SI  ProcessName\r\n==  ==  ===========\r\n11   1  cmd\r\n22   2  powershell\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo in this example, my function `Get-Process` fully specifies the default formatting while writing instances of `System.Diagnostics.Process` that can be used normally and later have a different format applied.\r\n\r\nFormatPx works like this using the existing format system, and I've implemented this idea in PSMore which is just barely functional as a prototype.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I'd like to see PowerShell move away from adding members to each instance and use type members as much as possible. I think this would be a win from a performance and usability point of view.",
