At least based on the help text for `Get-PSDrive`:\r\n\r\n> Also, beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, when an external drive is connected to the computer, PowerShell automatically adds a PSDrive to the file system that\r\n>     represents the new drive. You do not need to restart PowerShell. Similarly, when an external drive is disconnected from the computer, PowerShell automatically\r\n>     deletes the PSDrive that represents the removed drive.\r\n\r\n`mount` sees it (see last line):\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS /Users/jan> mount\r\n/dev/disk1s5 on / (apfs, local, read-only, journaled)\r\ndevfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)\r\n/dev/disk1s1 on /System/Volumes/Data (apfs, local, journaled, nobrowse)\r\n/dev/disk1s4 on /private/var/vm (apfs, local, journaled, nobrowse)\r\nmap auto_home on /System/Volumes/Data/home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)\r\n/dev/disk2s1 on /Volumes/Pulec (exfat, local, nodev, nosuid, noowners)\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nUSB drive is not displayed:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nPS /Users/jan> Get-PSDrive\r\n\r\nName           Used (GB)     Free (GB) Provider      Root                                                                                                 CurrentLocation\r\n----           ---------     --------- --------      ----                                                                                                 ---------------\r\n/                 155.46         78.01 FileSystem    /                                                                                                          Users/jan\r\nAlias                                  Alias\r\nEnv                                    Environment\r\nFunction                               Function\r\nTemp              155.46         78.01 FileSystem    /tmp/\r\nVariable                               Variable\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS /Users/jan> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-rc.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-rc.1\r\nOS                             Darwin 19.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.2.0: Sat Nov  9 03:47:04 PST 2019; root:xnu-6153.61.1~20/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

PowerShell doesn't _create_ a drive named \"E\", it recognizes \"E\" as a system drive.  If you connect Z: to \\\\localhost\\c$  outside PowerShell, it shows up as a PS drive. PS Drives is Aliases + Environment + Functions + Variables + filesystems known to the OS +  Windows' Registry + Certificates + WSMAN\r\nOn Unix-derived OSes there is one unified fs in which other file systems mount. Because there isn't a new file system root there is no drive to add. You can make a Windows style drive (so in WSL I can create a PS drive 'C' for /mnt/c ) or one can make a short name for a mounted USB.  But there wouldn't be much point in in creating a psdrive Volume_Pulec in order to allow `set-Location volume_pulec: ` instead of `set-Location /volume/pulec ` \r\n\r\n",
