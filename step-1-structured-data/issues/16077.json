      "body": "> I had a libmi.so.bak and libpsrpclient.so.bak file\r\n\r\nJust as an FYI `PSWSMan` creates these `.bak` files in case it needs to revert it back to the original ones. They are not part of the pwsh package itself. The permissions on `libmi.so` and `libpsrpclient.so` would be part of the pwsh package though just thought I would share some info on the .bak files.",
