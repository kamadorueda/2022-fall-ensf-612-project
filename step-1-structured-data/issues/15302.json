It's the closest thing PowerShell has to a lexically scoped variable and is overwritten at the start of every new script based command.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$PSScriptRoot = 'test'\r\n. { $PSScriptRoot }\r\n# empty\r\n```\r\n\r\n`-Parallel` would need to recreate the scriptblock with something like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar ast = Parser.ParseFile(originalSb.ToString(), originalSb.Ast.Extent.File, out _, out _);\r\nast.GetScriptBlock();\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut then the challenge is that the `PowerShell` API does not make it easy to directly invoke a scriptblock (#15004).\r\n\r\n<sub>(I know you already know that last bit, included for context)</sub>",
