  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI want this entire PowerShell Docs site as a downloadable (and printable - aka ring binder, take it to Staples and get it bound, etc) so I can have it as a desk reference.  I find paper books really helpful because they exist on my desk, and do not take up one of my monitors.  Bonus points for actually publishing these as paper books.  I'd give you $50 right now for this entire docs set as an actual book.  Maybe Reilly or someone would publish it?\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nHave a download PDF button for the entire PowerShell docs set.  Second, think about actually publishing this as an actual book through an actual publisher.  Or even have Docs sets available as books-made-to-order (maybe through Shutterfly)?",
