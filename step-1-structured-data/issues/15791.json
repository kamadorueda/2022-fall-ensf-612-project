  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRun this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$Host.EnterNestedPrompt()\r\nEnter-PSSession -VMName Server1 -Credential (Get-Credential)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen you do, you get the default `PS>` prompt and any command you enter will display `You should only run a nested pipeline from within a running pipeline.`   \r\nThe only way out from this state is to either interrupt the connection to the new runspace (unplug network cable/turn off VM) or close the window.\r\nOther hosts like ISE and the VS code host don't have this problem and work exactly like you would expect (Although ISE does lose its tabcompletion/intellisense features).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nAn interactive remote session to server1.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe default prompt: \"PS>\" and attempting to run any commands displays the message: You should only run a nested pipeline from within a running pipeline.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0-preview.7\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0-preview.7\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
