  "body": "At some point early on as I was reading code in Visual Studio I ignorantly thought it a good idea to build inside of Visual Studio. That did not work and there were no surprises. What did trip me up were these errors from `Start-PSBuild` afterwards:\n\n```\nC:\\dev\\powershell\\src\\System.Management.Automation\\project.json(142,77): error NU1001: The dependency Microsoft.PowerShe\nll.CoreCLR.AssemblyLoadContext >= 1.0.0-* could not be resolved.\n```\n\nI eventually found a project clean via `Start-PSBuild -Clean` remedied this but calling this out in the docs may save others the trouble.\n",
