      "body": "CodeFactor issues are violations of [SA1008](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers/blob/master/documentation/SA1008.md) due to added space after the `delegate` keyword. Rule documentation states an opening parenthesis can be preceded by whitespace when it is preceded by \"certain C# keywords\" but is ambiguous as to whether or not this applies to the delegate keyword. There is an open issue https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/issues/3257 concerning this behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe can apply a refactoring to replace the anonymous methods with `delegate` keyword with lamba expressions and avoid the rule violations. This would be a workaround but is also a recommended refactoring.",
