Is there a downside to automatically using some core namespaces that are among the most frequently used in PowerShell?",

One of the things we discussed that could help in the future is allowing using system.management.automation.actionpreference as actionpreference to get custom type accelerators within your script.\r\n",

      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT  and @BrucePay, what are your thoughts on this approach, which would make the need for type accelerators and aliases much less important when it comes to PowerShell itself, without sacrificing runtime performance:\r\n\r\nWithin the PowerShell parser, automatically recognize:\r\n\r\n|This type|as this type|\r\n|--|--|\r\n|`[S.M.A.whatever]`|`[System.Management.Automation.whatever]`|\r\n|`[S.M.A.L.whatever]`|`[System.Management.Automation.Language.whatever]`|\r\n|`[S.M.A.R.whatever]`|`[System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.whatever]`|\r\n\r\nThat wouldn't require a specific feature (type aliases), and it would reduce the need for type accelerator bloat. When we're talking about PS types, we often say/type `S.M.A....` already. This would be just applying how we talk about these things to the actual code we write.\r\n\r\n### Alternative\r\n\r\nDrop the dots, i.e. instead of using `S.M.A.` as the prefix, use `SMA.`, and so on. I think I prefer with the dots though.\r\n\r\n### Alternative 2\r\n\r\nUse a numeronym instead, e.g. `S26n` in place of `System.Management.Automation`. \ud83e\udd23 \r\n\r\n### Potential breaking change\r\n\r\nIf someone out there has `S.M.A.whatever` or similar class names, this would break those.",

      "body": "I think aliasing these namespaces in this particular manner is... not particularly effective, and probably would tend to make scripts less clear in reading, at least to folks unaware of this sort of shortcut (which will, inevitably, be the majority of the PS community in most cases; after all, _where_ would you document such a shortcut while being able to expect people will easily come across it?)\r\n\r\nConsidering we already have some shortcuts where we can, for example, often omit the `System` prefix for many namespaces (if not all?) in some cases that I see here and there, why not simply add `Automation` as a short-cut to `System.Management.Automation`? i.e., where you want to use `System.Management.Automation.ErrorRecord` you can effectively cut it in half and just use `Automation.ErrorRecord`.\r\n\r\nThis has the advantage of being _much_ less likely to collide with type names from other namespaces, and remains quite short and to the point, while being much more clear in intent (in my opinion) than an overly abbreviated `S.M.A.L.` shortcut and so forth. If we wanted to use a more explicit alias like `PSAutomation` or some such for this shortcut, I think that may also be worth considering.\r\n\r\nI think we need to balance clarity of intent with the need to shorten that namespace length, and attempt to avoid causing unnecessarily avoidable collisions where we can here.",

On the contrary. `Automation` is much more likely to be used as a namespace name already than `S.M.A`.\r\n\r\nI had also considered simply using `PS` or the `PS` prefix for the `System.Management.Automation` shortcut, but I don't like the shortcut being that far from the original name. With PowerShell already supporting pithy names in many cases, the `S.M.A.*.` approach fits. It also fits with the recent proposals on how to handle Intellisense with camel case command names.\r\n\r\nThe goal I'm trying to reach here is worthy of a solution: make working with overly verbose, native, common PowerShell types in PowerShell much easier by default, so that you get easy access to those types whether you're using PowerShell ad hoc or in a script.\r\n\r\nMy preference is still for automatic using (as proposed at the top of this issue), but if the PS team doesn't feel that's acceptable, what alternative do they propose?",
