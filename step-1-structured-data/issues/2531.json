  "body": "SSH based remoting no longer works when connecting to a Windows machine with Win32-OpenSSH installed.  The reason is that PowerShell expects a console to be available when hosted in a process and Win32-OpenSSH now creates subsystem processes without a console.\n\nThis should be Ok for remoting because PowerShell in server mode has no need for a console.  So the fix should be in PowerShell where it can fail gracefully when a console is not available.\n",
