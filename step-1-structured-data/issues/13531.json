Also you could read docs in the repo (they could be out of date :-( ). This project definitely lacks experts to review code.\r\nMSFT team has a blog post about Work Groups. PowerShell is large and complex and it is impossible to know well all code base so every WG brings together experts in an area of expertise. You can join a WG that matches your interests.\r\n\r\nAs for the issue, feel free to contribute. We ask to do PRs as small as possible. (You can be asked to add new tests if a code is not covered by tests and to measure performance if PR is related to performance.)",
