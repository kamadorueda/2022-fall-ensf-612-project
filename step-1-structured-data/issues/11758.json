  "body": "Trying the simplest of commands while trying to sign a file.\r\n```\r\n$Cert = Get-PfxCertificate -FilePath \"myCert.pfx\"\r\nSet-AuthenticodeSignature \"MyApp.app\" -Certificate $Cert\r\n```\r\nTo put some background around my issues, I am trying to run this on a newly created Azure Windows 2019 server. (The same certificate and file types work as expected on the \"old\" Azure Windows 2016 server.)\r\n\r\nTo make it more frustrating, I can sign a \".ps1\" file on the new 2019 server. I can either create the \".ps1\" file as new or even renaming the \".app\" file to \".ps1\" allows signing correctly.\r\n\r\nAny help with this would be appreciated. I can't seem to find any logs for the UnknownError so it's very difficult know what the issue is.\r\n\r\n```\r\nSignerCertificate                         Status                                                         Path                                                         \r\n-----------------                         ------                                                         ----                                                         \r\n                                          UnknownError                                                   MyApp.app \r\n```",
