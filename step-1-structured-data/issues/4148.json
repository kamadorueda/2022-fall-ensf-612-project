      "body": "@adityapatwardhan What are you looking for regarding tests for \"Get-ChildItem for file\"? Just that it will return information about the file specified?\r\n\r\nWhat is the expected behavior if, for example, `Get-ChildItem` is given a specific, non-globbed file name and also the `-Directory` parameter? Should it return information about the file anyway or return nothing because the file is not a directory?\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding \"Rename-Item for directory\", do you just mean that the cmdlet can rename a directory, or something more involved than that?",

So some tests might not look very useful, but there is untested code that exists and hence we need to exercise those code paths.\r\n",
