The package manager will update the previous package automatically when you install the new package.\n\nOnce the package is installed, if you want to uninstall it (keeping in mind that you do not have to), you can use the `apt-get` [package manager](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AptGet/Howto) to do so: `sudo apt-get remove powershell`.\n",
