  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nOne might easily index into a `string`:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n'Test'[1]\r\ne\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd a `Text.StringBuilder` type where it is even possible to write:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$Test = [System.Text.StringBuilder]'test'\r\n$Test[1] = 'a'\r\n$Test.ToString()\r\nTast\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom that aspect, one might also assume to be able to easily iterate through either of these types using the PowerShell  `.where` or `.foreach` methods. Yet, currently, it is required to setup a loop for this, similar to e.g.:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nfor ($i = 0, $i -lt $Test.Length; $i++) { $_[$i] }\r\n```\r\nOr transform everything into a character array:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$LongString.ToCharArray()\r\n```\r\nWhich would be quiet expensive, if I would like to do something like this:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$LongString.where({ $_ -ne $Char }, 'First').foreach{ ... }\r\n```\r\n\r\nA lot of use cases for this request might of cause also achieved with regular expressions, but regular expressions are not PowerShell and therefore more cryptic and limited to a certain complexity.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "(a) It's a breaking change    `$x = $longstring.where({$_ -match ' ' }) `  is a short cut for\r\n ```\r\nif ($longstring -match ` `) {$x = $longString} else {$x = $null}  \r\n```\r\n(b) What is so bad about   `[char[]]\"LongString\" | where {$_ -ne \"o\"} | foreach {\"$_\".toUpper()}`   ?\r\n(c) Regular expressions are a core part of PowerShell - used by `-match` , `-split` etc.   `$longstring -split ''` gives an array of strings rather than chars so is better than (b) IMHO. \r\n\r\n",
