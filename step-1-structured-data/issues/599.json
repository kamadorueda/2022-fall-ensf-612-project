  "body": "This updates .NET CLI to build 1540 (highest common denominator of 1.0.0 available across all platforms) and the .NET packages to the latest rc3-23826 build.\n\nWe needed to add the `System.Threading.Thread` package to `System.Management.Automation`, and remove the `DataTable` stub from Core PowerShell, hence this requires PowerShell/psl-monad#25.\n\nThis also tested the cache invalidation of the CI machines.\n",
