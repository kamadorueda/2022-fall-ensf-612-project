  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Open PowerShell in the standard conhost\r\n2. Paste the following code into the console\r\n3. Close the spawned window and the PowerShell console window and note the time it takes to close\r\n\r\n```\r\nAdd-Type -AssemblyName System.Windows.Forms\r\n$Form=[System.Windows.Forms.Form]::new()\r\n$Form.ShowDialog()\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn my system it takes about 5 seconds to close. This slowdown also happens if you have used `Get-Help -ShowWindow` or `Out-Gridview` in that session.  \r\nThis slowdown does not happen in Windows PowerShell or if you use the Windows terminal for PowerShell.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nThe PowerShell window instantly closes when clicking on the X.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe PowerShell window takes 5 seconds to close when clicking on the X after having used a GUI.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.3.0-preview.8\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.3.0-preview.8\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

Can you try it on the latest rc release? and have you installed .NET separately somehow that might be causing this? I am suspect that this might be a .NET bug rather than PowerShell.",

So my .NET installations shouldn't matter.
