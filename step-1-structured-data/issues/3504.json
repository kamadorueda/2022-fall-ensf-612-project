  "body": "Related #3347 \r\n\r\nIt is expected that the AppVeyor CI failed.\r\n\r\nThe meta tests run only on AppVeyor CI and locally.\r\nThe meta tests by default check only new and changed files from \"current\" PR (compared with origin/master).\r\nTherefore, the PR for demo includes test files for each type of validation - this is what causes CI tests to fail. These test files should be deleted before merge.\r\n\r\nNow check of all files in Repo is blocked. We can allow it if necessary for example for night builds.\r\n\r\nAfter merging the PR we will have to produce every modified file in line with the meta tests.\r\n",
