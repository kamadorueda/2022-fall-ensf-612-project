      "body": "@ChrisMagnuson: Indeed, `Set-StrictMode -Version 1` and higher cause a _statement-terminating error_ when you reference an uninitialized variable, but don't allow you to change the _enumeration behavior_.\r\n\r\nThe only way to avoid enumeration of `$null` is to use the `foreach` _loop_ instead of the pipeline (e.g. `foreach($v in $null) { <# never entered #> }`) - a discrepancy that is in itself problematic, let alone that substituting one for the other is not always an option.\r\n\r\nOne way out of this would be to let uninitialized variables default to the \"null collection\", `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` rather than to `$null`, given that this null collection is enumerated in neither scenario.  \r\n\r\nThat would still enumerate _explicit_ `$null` values (in the pipeline), but that is less problematic, given that commands must go out of their way to output `$null` (not producing any output implicitly results in `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value`).\r\n\r\nHowever, that would clearly be a breaking change.",

$noSuchVar | ForEach-Object { 'inside ForEach-Object' }\r\ninside ForEach-Object\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `foreach` loop didn't enumerate anything, but the pipeline did:\r\n\r\n* It is the _pipeline_ that acts as expected here: given that uninitialized variables default to `$null`, it enumerates that `$null`.\r\n\r\n* Unexpectedly, the `foreach` loop does _not_ enumerate the `$null`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe same discrepancy happens with an _initialized_ variable that _happens to contain `$null`_:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> $varThatIsNull = $null; foreach ($var in $varThatIsNull) { 'inside the foreach loop' }; $varThatIsNull | ForEach-Object { 'inside ForEach-Object' }\r\ninside ForEach-Object\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe only time the discrepancy does _not_ surface is by _direct use of a command_ that outputs `$null`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> foreach ($var in & { $null }) { 'inside the foreach loop' }; & { $null } | ForEach-Object { 'inside inside the foreach loop' }\r\ninside the foreach loop\r\ninside inside the foreach loop\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how the `foreach` loop now too enumerated the `$null` output by the script block.\r\n\r\nThis is the subject of #5674, though the OP there is looking for the opposite behavior: they want `foreach` not to enumerate in this case either.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAgain: These inconsistencies could be resolved if:\r\n\r\n*  both the `foreach` loop _and_ the pipeline consistently enumerate `$null`\r\n\r\n* if uninitialized variables default to `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` rather than `$null`.\r\n\r\nRemember that `$null -eq $noSuchVar` would continue to work, because, as stated, `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` acts like `$null` when forced into a scalar context (try `$null -eq (& {})` - `& {}` being the simplest statement that produces a `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` value).\r\n\r\nNote that reversing the operands should arguably work differently, given that `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` should be considered an _enumerable_ (array-valued) LHS, but `(& {}) -eq $null` does currently return `$True`, i.e., treats `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` as a _scalar_\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3866#issuecomment-304764165 discusses this and shows that the current behavior is inconsistent in that the behavior varies depending on the operator used.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be warranted from a consistency perspective, making `$noSuchVar -eq $null` return `@()` - i.e., treating the `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` LHS as array-valued - would be a massively breaking change, because existing code that relies on such conditionals to return `$True` (whether explicitly or not) would break.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs another (farther) aside: #6823 is another example of inconsistent use of `$null` vs. `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value`.\r\n\r\n",
