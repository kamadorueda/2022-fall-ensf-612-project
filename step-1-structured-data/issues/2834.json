  "body": "When defining a function, I would like to use an environment variable as the default value. If the environment variable exists and has a value that value will be used. For example,\r\n\r\nfunction Get-Info ([Alias(\"name\")] [Parameter(Mandatory=$true, ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName=$true)] [string] $projectName = **$env:Project_Name**) \r\n{ \r\n}\r\n\r\nInstead of having to passing in the Project Name for each call I would like to store it in an environment variable. When I do it would allow me to call Get-Info with no parameters and the value in the environment variable would be used. If the environment variable does not exist or is empty the user would be prompted for a value if it was not provided on the command line. \r\n\r\nI tried writing the code as I have above but it never seemed to work. Even when the environment variable was set I was always prompted for projectName. \r\n\r\nI know I could remove the mandatory attribute and add code in my function to set to the environment variable if it exists. But it would be much easier if what I am proposing was possible. \r\n\r\nI also thought about using $PSDefaultParameterValues. This would almost be a short hand version of that set by the function writer and not the user.",

Some questions that come to mind:\r\n* If a parameter is mandatory in one parameter set but not another, what should happen?\r\n* If the parameter has a validation attribute\r\n  * Should validation be performed on the default? (That doesn't happen today.)\r\n  * Should validation failure result in prompting?\r\n\r\nI'm sure more questions will come to mind if we consider this further.",

My natural instinct was to set the default value to a env var and it simply did not work.  \r\n\r\nI expected this to work similar to the Docker cli.  If you set the Docker Host as in Env Var you don't have to pass it to each and every command because it will read the Env Var instead.  I was looking for a similar feature with PowerShell. I think the closest thing is the $PSDefaultParameterValues.  However, when I tried to set that value via an Advanced Function it did not seem to \"stick\"  after I ran the function my values were not there.  The only way that worked is if I set them on the cmd line then tried to run a function.  I hope I did something wrong and will research further.\r\n\r\nIn a nut shell I did not expect any new rules for how defaults were handled I just wanted to be able to set the default to an Env Var.  If the Env Var is !NullOrEmpty use it.  If it NullOrEmpty behave as if the value was not passed.  For mandatory you would prompt if not you would not.",
