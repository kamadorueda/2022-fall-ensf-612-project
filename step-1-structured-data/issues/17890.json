  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCurrently building a package for `powershell` on Alpine Linux. In packaging, build pipeline detects libraries that point to `glibc.so`, which should not happen on `linux-musl-x64` platform. This suggests that build process pulls prebuilt libraries, which should not occur when building from source.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, `git clone https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/ayakael/aports -b testing/powershell-keep-prebuilt` and `abuild -r` in any Alpine environment eqal or greater to version 3.16 when in `aports/testing/powershell` directory. Towards the end, `abuild` will tell you that a library pointing to `glibc.so` was detected. I suspect that building process is to blame, but perhaps not.\r\n\r\nAport for build process is accessible [here](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/ayakael/aports/-/blob/testing/powershell-keep-prebuilt/testing/powershell/APKBUILD)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPrebuilt libraries should not be pulled.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n`libSystem.IO.Ports.Native.so` points to `glibc.so`, which implies prebuilt libraries are pulled.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\n$ ldd libSystem.IO.Ports.Native.so\r\n/lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1 (0x7293b7c25000)\r\nlibc.so.6 => /lib/ld-musl-x86_64.so.1 (0x7293b7c25000\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.6\r\nOS                             Linux 5.4.157-1-pve #1 SMP PVE 5.4.157-1 (Mon, 29 Nov 2021 12:01:44 +0100)\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
