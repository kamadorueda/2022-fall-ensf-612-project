  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nRelated to https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/141\r\n\r\nGet-Module/Import-Module should search for and recognize prerelease module folder syntax used in PowershellGet v3. This will allow for more than one prerelease to be installed at a time.\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nUpdate Get-Module so that it also recognizes prerelease module paths.\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
