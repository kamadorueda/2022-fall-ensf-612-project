  "body": "### request: don't override `Port` directive in ssh_config\r\n\r\nSimilar to #11344, the StartSSHProcess() function always passes a `-p <port>` command line argument to the underlying operating system's ssh client even when `-Port <port>` is not passed to the *PSSession cmdlets.\r\n\r\nThis overrides the `Port <port>` directive that a system administrator might have set in an ssh_config file.\r\n\r\nThe ssh client already assumes port 22 and it is not necessary to provide a default port from the StartSSHProcess() function.\r\n\r\nThis is not as problematic as #11344 since sshd is typically deployed to listen on port 22. Nevertheless, it's not appropriate to override ssh_config directives unless `-Port <port>` is passed to cmdlets explicitly.\r\n\r\nAs a system administrator, I want to generate ssh configuration files containing directives that aren't overriden by PowerShell's invocation of ssh.\r\n\r\n### proposal: do not pass `-p <port>` to ssh client unless `-Port <port>` is passed to cmdlets\r\n\r\nWhen invoking *PSSession cmdlets, if `-Port <port>` isn't used , then don't pass `-p <port>` as a command line argument to the ssh client.\r\n",
