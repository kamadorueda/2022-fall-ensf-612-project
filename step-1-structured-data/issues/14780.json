  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSince PowerShell is distributed through different channels now (eg. installer, package manager or Store); it's more convenient that new version release notices appear per channel; or it's rather inconvenient that an update notice appears when there's no new release for a specific channel.\r\n\r\nCurrently, as I have opted in for Microsoft Store distribution channel, I get the notice to update PowerShell to v7.1.2 while the latest release on MS Store is v7.1.1 as stated below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8382714/107799344-8c270980-6d72-11eb-9ec6-bdcc2ac58649.png)\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nCheck the version availability with the channel provider with for target build, or create different channels on where the queries are made and send installed version properties (like current version and package manager) with the query.\r\n",
