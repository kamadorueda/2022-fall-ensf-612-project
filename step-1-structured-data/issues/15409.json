  "body": "## Problem description\r\n\r\nIn `Invoke-RestMethod`, the **PassThru** parameter must be used with the **OutFile** parameter. The intent is that you can write the results to the file and get the output to the pipeline. But the cmdlets only write to the pipeline, not the file.\r\n\r\nThe problem code starts here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/38d582f038f31acfc1a748d60a5331eb82a3bd28/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/Common/InvokeRestMethodCommand.Common.cs#L387\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nif (ShouldWriteToPipeline)\r\n{\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\nelse if (ShouldSaveToOutFile)\r\n{\r\n   ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotice that the logic outputs pipeline and skips the output to the file. Both `ShouldWriteToPipeline` and `ShouldSaveToOutFile` can be true so need to remove the `else`.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-RestMethod https://taxonomyservice.azurefd.net/taxonomies/product-uri -PassThru -OutFile C:\\temp\\irm.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nOutput to console and to the file.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nOutput to console only. The output file is not created.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\nThis affects all versions 5.1 and higher.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "After further investigation, removing the `else` does not fix the problem. When the `else` is removed, the outfile is created but empty. The problem is that the stream is consumed by writing to the pipeline. There is no way to rewind the stream so that it can be written to the file as well.\r\n\r\nThe only \"fix\" would be to disallow the parameter combination. That would be a breaking change.",

For small files, we _could_ cache the file in memory as a memory stream before saving/outputting, since those allow us to rewind the stream.\r\n\r\nTo account for large files, it might make sense to use a MemoryStream (or similar) as a buffer (make it say 1024 bytes or whatever) and:\r\n\r\n- copy X bytes from the StreamHelper into the MemoryStream\r\n- write all those to the pipeline from the stream\r\n- rewind the MemoryStream\r\n- write the bytes to the file\r\n- repeat the process until there's no more data from the StreamHelper",
