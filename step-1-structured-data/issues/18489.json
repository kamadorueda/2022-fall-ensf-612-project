      "body": "Those commands and output look to be correct per semver as everything after the + sign is considered build metadata and not used for version comparision.\r\n\r\n> Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. **Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining version precedence.** Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85, 1.0.0+21AF26D3\u2014-117B344092BD.\r\n\r\n> Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (**Build metadata does not figure into precedence**).",
