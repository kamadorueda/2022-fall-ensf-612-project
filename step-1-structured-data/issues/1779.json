  "body": "As a devops type nerd, I want to be able to install and update PowerShell/OSX via the CLI, and also with my preferred packaging tool, namely Homebrew (http://brew.sh). \n\nYes, the the OSX native installer packages (.pkg) can be installed via CLI (with the `installer` command), but it requires sudo. AFAICT, PowerShell is installed to /usr/local/bin and does not require sudo at all otherwise. \n\nHomebrew is basically the de-facto CLI package manager on OSX like choco.exe is on Windows. It does not require sudo for packages to be installed.\n\nInstructions to create a formula: https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/Formula-Cookbook.md\n",
