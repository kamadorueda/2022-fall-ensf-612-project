  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThe output formatting system's purpose is to present data to the _human_ reader.\r\n(As such - because the formatted output isn't meant for _programmatic_ processing - it isn't part of PowerShell's breaking-changes contract.)\r\n\r\nCurrently, large numbers are output without thousands separators, i.e. without grouping the digits for easier comprehension.\r\n\r\nI suggest applying this grouping to all numbers (that aren't explicitly formatted via formatting data):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING - but you can get a preview with the prototype below.\r\n\r\n# Number by itself (out-of-band formatting)\r\nPS> 1000\r\n1,000\r\n\r\n# Implicit in-band formatting (table or list)\r\nPS> @{ num = 1000 }\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nnum                            1,000\r\n\r\n# Should also automatically apply to types with explicit formatting data \r\n# (unless number formatting is part of a given list item / table column).\r\n# Note the \"Size\" column.\r\nPS> Get-Item $PROFILE\r\n\r\n    Directory: /Users/jdoe/.config/powershell\r\n\r\nUnixMode   User             Group                 LastWriteTime           Size  Name\r\n--------   ----             -----                 -------------           ----  ----\r\n-rw-r--r-- jdoe             staff              10/23/2019 22:31           1,934  Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs @ThomasNieto [proposes below](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13590#issuecomment-688354542), a new _preference variable_ and _new switch_  for the `Format-*` cmdlets could allow opting into the old behavior. E.g.: `$PSThousandsGrouping` with values `$true` and `$false` (default `$true`), and switch\r\n`-ThousandsGrouping`.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nHere's a quick _prototype_ that uses the ETS. It is _not_ the suggested implementation, for reasons of both performance and also changing the behavior of explicit `.ToString()` calls.\r\n\r\nA proper implementation would require modifying the formatting system itself.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Prototype:\r\n[int16], [int], [long], [double], [decimal], [bigint], [uint16], [uint], [uint64] | % {\r\n\r\n  Update-TypeData -TypeName $_.FullName  -MemberType ScriptMethod -MemberName ToString -Value { \r\n    # Determine how many decimal places there are in the original representation.\r\n    # Note: PowerShell's string interpolation uses the *invariant* culture, so '.'\r\n    #       can reliably be assumed to be the decimal mark.\r\n    $numDecimalPlaces = (\"$this\" -replace '^[^.]+(?:.(.+))?', '$1').Length\r\n\r\n    # Format with thousands grouping and the same number of decimal places.\r\n    # Note: This will create a culture-sensitive representation\r\n    #       just like with the default output formatting.\r\n     # CAVEAT:\r\n     #  To avoid a crash (from infinite recursion?), both .psobject.BaseObject \r\n     #  and the -f operator must be used.\r\n     #  ($this.psobject.BaseObject.ToString(\"...\") also crashes).\r\n    \"{0:N$numDecimalPlaces}\" -f $this.psobject.BaseObject\r\n  } -Force\r\n\r\n}\r\n```",

I just expect a lot of confusion around it if it gets implemented.  Similar to how some format definitions include columns that aren't real properties, I see folks having issues with that at least once a week.
