  "body": "When upgrading from v7 RC to RC, my pinned pwsh.exe shortcut on the taskbar (pinned from the [shortcut you create](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/00b60c44fa91606a7458c3e9a428f8d05c0639d7/assets/Product.wxs#L247)) disappears. This is because Windows Installer icons via WiX's `<Icon>` element get random GUIDs that change from release to release. As a former WiX dev and looong-time setup dev, we recommended people away from those icons and other advertised features because of various problems like this.\r\n\r\nYou can still use it if you want to customize your Add/Remove Programs (ARP) entry like you do via `ARPPRODUCTICON`, but don't set the `Shortcut@Icon` property to it. Instead, omit the `@Icon` attribute and it will default to the first icon index in the target EXE instead of a cached path to the Windows Installer cache that will change from release to release as you rebuild your MSI.",

It's stored within the MSI for advertisement purposes originally (i.e. not in the `File` table, which are tied to components) so files weren't installed but the product was registered. As such, it gets a randomly-generated file name in the Windows Installer cache and will change each time.",

If you want that to be the colorful preview one, you'll need to embed that in your EXE. If you want to keep the regular one as the first index, add the colorful one as a separate index, use WiX 3.x, and use the `@IconIndex` attribute as documented here: https://documentation.help/WiX-v3.0/wix_xsd_shortcut.htm\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://documentation.help/favicon.ico\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://documentation.help/WiX-v3.0/wix_xsd_shortcut.htm\">Shortcut Element - Windows Installer XML (WiX) v3.0 Documentation</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
