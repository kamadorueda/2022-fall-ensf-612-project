It will fail at around line 847 of `src\\Microsoft.PowerShell.PackageManagement\\Cmdlets\\AsyncCmdlet.cs` which it contains some non-ASCII characters when logging. Changing system locale to English will work.\n## Expected behavior\n\nIt should build on systems with non-English system locale.\n## Actual behavior\n\nFailed to build.\n## Environment data\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\n> $PSVersionTable\n\n```\n",

      "body": "I believe it is because the file is not saved as UTF-8 so right now the left & right pointing double angle quotation mark are in their ASCII value which is `0xAB` and `0xBB`; when read on a system with Chinese as default system locale, the `0xBB` and ending `\"` will be treated as a DBCS character thus causing compiler to fail. If we save the file as UTF-8 they will become `0xC2AB` and `0xC2BB`, which works correctly on any system locales.\n",
