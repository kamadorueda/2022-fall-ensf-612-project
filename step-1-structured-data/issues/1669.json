  "body": "Resolves #1663.\n\nThere's yet more clean up to do of the platform class (and I have some ongoing), but wanted to get this out first. This was primarily concerned with not throwing when unable to get the Unix domain or user name. After some discussion with @daxian-dbw, we're foregoing removing the current code to use `IPGlobalProperties` in order to reduce churn, as .NET Core 1.1 will bring back all the necessary APIs for us to delete much of this code.\n\nThis also has the refactor of `InternalGetFolderPath` as I happened to do it while I was in the file, and unfortunately then moved the `Unix` class under `Platform`, so moving 3f9889d6d after ec3414c11 would be a pain.\n",
