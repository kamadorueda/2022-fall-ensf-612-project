  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\n- Run core powershell\n- Wait until you got prompt\n- Try to do one of these things very fast (immediately after your got cursor)\n  - Hit `Esc`\n  - Hit `Ctrl+R`\n  - Type something and execute (i.e. `$pid`)\n## Expected behavior\n\nAs soon as you got cursor after prompt, you should be able to work\n## Actual behavior\n\nPowerShell doesn't work, even after it show the prompt. It works only after few seconds.\n\nOn this screenshot, a actually **hit** enter, after first `$pid`\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/816680/16548054/ba63b626-4136-11e6-9432-3929655700bb.png)\n\nOn this screenshot I hit `Ctrl+R`\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/816680/16548075/7f606988-4137-11e6-85c2-fa4873c9cfa3.png)\n## Environment data\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\n> $PSVersionTable\nName                           Value                                                                                                        \n----                           -----                                                                                                        \nPSVersion                      5.1.10032.0                                                                                                  \nPSEdition                      Linux                                                                                                        \nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                      \nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0                                                                                                      \nGitCommitId                    v0.5.0-259-gc91fc2324aa5ec543173ed205b9200624a5fa637-dirty                                                   \nCLRVersion                                                                                                                                  \nWSManStackVersion              1.0                                                                                                          \nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                          \nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1    \n```\n",
