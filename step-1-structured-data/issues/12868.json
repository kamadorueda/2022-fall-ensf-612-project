  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSuppose you want to write a handy \"goto\" helper function, which acts as a helper to set your current working directory. Ideally your helper would use `pushd` (`Push-Location`), but it cannot, because `pushd` in a module will use a separate, module-scoped location stack. There is currently no way (that I know of) to access the user's global location stack from a module. (The only way to have such a helper currently is to have code in your $profile.)\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nI haven't put a ton of thought into this, but an easy way to do this would be to introduce a new parameter to `Push-Location`: `-GlobalStack`.\r\n",

Also an empty string is the name of the default location stack.",
