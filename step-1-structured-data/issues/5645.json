  "body": "We need to support running tests in root privilege on Linux Travis CI in a similar way as our windows tests running in AppVeyor. For windows tests, we have a tag `RequireAdminOnWindows` to indicate the tests that need admin privilege. We run those tests in an admin `pwsh` session, and then we use `runas` to remove admin privilege and run the rest tests.\r\n\r\nWith `sudo: required` in `.travis.yml`, Travis CI Linux builds run in regular user privilege by default, but you can get the root privilege using `sudo` with no need to provide a password (see the [documentation](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/installing-dependencies/#Installing-Snap-Packages)). So we should be able to support a similar tag like `RequireAdminOnWindows` on Linux.",
