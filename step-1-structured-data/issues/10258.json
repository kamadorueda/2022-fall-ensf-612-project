  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel that he icon in Powershell 7 is not balanced and with a very neon pink and a very soft blue. I have a proposed icon that had slightly different colors as I saw in the Powershell 7 assets Powershell_avatar and I thought it still needed to look flashy.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nHere is my proposed icon that I feel has more balanced colors over the purple and pink.\r\n[pwsh_32513.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/3445231/pwsh_32513.zip)\r\n\r\nI would love to hear feedback on it and if anyone feels like my proposed colors aren't fitting. \r\nI did take a color theory class in college.\r\n",

I noticed the\r\n[pwsh_32513.zip](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/3449856/pwsh_32513.zip)\r\nI picked the color triad of orange hex(ec7a00), red-orange hex(b01e00), and the current blue hex(00a3c9). the current analogical purple hex(461466), pink hex(ec008c) and the same blue, feel like they are vibrating and uncomfortable to the eyes.\r\n\r\nI didn't do a re-theme of the Powershell avatar but, it looks like its just a de-saturation of the current colors and I understand that the whole theme is suppose to sell this avatar from it being in the assets folder.",

Only the Preview releases get the avatar themed one.\r\n\r\n@whitequill your version actually looks pretty good, but not sure what we'd use it for since we already have branded icons to differentiate stable and preview releases.",
