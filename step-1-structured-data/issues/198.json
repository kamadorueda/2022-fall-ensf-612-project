  "body": "Native code was reviewed and accepted, so this feature is now available in libps. Now we need monad to use the appropriate code.  Update  GetCPInfo is  currently  only used by the function, IsSingleByteCharacterSystem  . However, this question is always answerable on Linux, as false, because only UTF 8 is supported on Linux  which is not an SBCS . So rather than deal with implementing the cross platform abstractions necessary to call our native function over Windows, we just answer the question directly.  Since that was the only place GetCPInfo was used, unless there's a compelling reason to leave it as a native call, we should remove it from libps.
