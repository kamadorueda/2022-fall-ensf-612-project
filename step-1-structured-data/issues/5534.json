  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n1. Open Powershell as admin\r\n2. Run `Update-Help -Force`\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nHelp files are installed and accessible when running Get-Help.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nHelp files are not installed locally, and running Get-Help returns the message `Get-Help cannot find the Help files for this cmdlet on this computer. It is displaying only partial help.`.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-rc\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-rc\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.15063\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nObservations\r\n----------------\r\nI was unable to reproduce this problem in 2 other systems, both running Windows 10 Fall Creators Update and the same version of Powershell, so I'm not sure if this is related to the affected system being on Creators Update. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n",
