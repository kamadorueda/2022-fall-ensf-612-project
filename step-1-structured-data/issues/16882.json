  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nWhen using the `Show-Markdown` cmdlet, a user may want to get the output as plain text and save it somewhere rather than just displaying it in the terminal. Therefore, a new cmdlet like `Render-Markdown` or just a switch parameter can be added to get the output in just plain text.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

Why not just output the string or use `Get-Content` on the file path?",
