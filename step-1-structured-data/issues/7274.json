  "body": "So, we have a PS script that interacts with a few APIs of ours that is currently working on our dev environment (Win10). When we tried to publish it on a jenkins pipeline, we had this error \"Access to the path '/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/ca' is denied.\". So we went back to our scrapbook and tried to reproduce on our WLS and got this error this time: Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates\r\n\r\nWe've tried to manually register our certificate on linux but it had no effect,\r\nWe also tried to invoke a public rest API that uses a Google cert and it worked.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the errors are related at all, but we couldn't find anything regarding this matter on the issues.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nInvoke-RestMethod to any of our servers that uses a GoDaddy SSL cert\r\nThe method is being called from:\r\n1 - Docker official latest image;\r\n2 - Ubuntu 18.04 (inside Windows 10)\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nResponse of the given API call\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nOn docker image: Invoke-RestMethod : Access to the path '/.dotnet/corefx/cryptography/x509stores/ca' is denied.\r\nOn WLS: Invoke-RestMethod : Peer certificate cannot be authenticated with given CA certificates\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.2\r\nOS                             Linux 4.4.0-17134-Microsoft #137-Microsoft Thu Jun 14 18:46:00 PST 2018\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
