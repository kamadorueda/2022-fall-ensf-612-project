      "body": "Hi @GrantMeStrength - I'm not sure which terminal your using, however the color scheme is defined in PSReadLine and works well for black and dark blue backgrounds.  The good news is you can change the colors of each individual element to adjust to your color preferences.  The cmdlet to see the colors is Get-PSReadLineOption - and here is a link to documentation on how to change the colors to your needs -> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/set-psreadlineoption?view=powershell-7.2#example-1-set-foreground-and-background-colors\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo-powershell-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/psreadline/set-psreadlineoption\">Set-PSReadLineOption (PSReadLine) - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>The Set-PSReadLineOption cmdlet customizes the behavior of the PSReadLine module when you're editing the command line. To view the PSReadLine settings, use Get-PSReadLineOption. </div></blockquote>",

      "body": "It is worth noting that the \"default\" color scheme on the macOS Terminal has a white background. I switched to the \"Pro\" profile which has a black background since PS looks way better on a dark background. It is too bad PS can't detect the bg (dark/light) and adjust the default colors for the background.",
