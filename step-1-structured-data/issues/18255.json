  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nRelated:\r\n * #3172\r\n * #13312\r\n * #13598\r\n\r\n`[datetimeoffset]` offers many advantages of `[datetime]`, and is therefore generally preferable.\r\n\r\nOne obstacle to its wider adoption is its unwieldy _display formatting_, which currently  - due to the absence of formatting data - simply provides `Format-List` formatting for all properties of a `[datetimeoffset` instance, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# UNDESIRED\r\nPS> [datetimeoffset]::Now\r\n\r\nDateTime      : 10/11/2022 12:08:42 AM\r\nUtcDateTime   : 10/11/2022 4:08:42 AM\r\nLocalDateTime : 10/11/2022 12:08:42 AM\r\nDate          : 10/11/2022 12:00:00 AM\r\nDay           : 11\r\nDayOfWeek     : Tuesday\r\nDayOfYear     : 284\r\nHour          : 0\r\nMillisecond   : 886\r\nMicrosecond   : 4\r\nNanosecond    : 0\r\nMinute        : 8\r\nMonth         : 10\r\nOffset        : -04:00:00\r\nSecond        : 42\r\nTicks         : 638010437228860040\r\nUtcTicks      : 638010581228860040\r\nTimeOfDay     : 00:08:42.8860040\r\nYear          : 2022\r\n```\r\n\r\nA much more reasonable default representation would  be to simply use the `.ToString()` representation, which is a single-line representation that helpfully includes the UTC offset; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> [datetimeoffset]::Now.ToString()  # This should be the default representation; note the UTC-offset suffix.\r\n10/11/2022 12:10:39 AM -04:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlternatively, make the representation more verbose to include the weekday and month _name_, as with `[datetime]`'s default output formatting, but the important part is that the UTC offset be included.\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
