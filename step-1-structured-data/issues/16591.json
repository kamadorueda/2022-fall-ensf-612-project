  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nFor my example i used a simple script to output \"Test\":\r\n`Write-Output \"Test\"`\r\n\r\nRunning the script from Command line result in unstable results.\r\nSeveral times, the script will run correctly.\r\nHowever after a running the scripts a few times, the script will not execute.\r\n\r\nFor running scripts in MSBuild, i get the same result. The script gets called by MSBuild, however the build will stop there as the script is not executed.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nTest\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nScript not executing consistently\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNo Error returned\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\nAs seen in the image below, the scripts runs correct several times and outputs \"Test\".\r\nAt the last time we see the command is send, but the script is not executed.\r\nWithin the process explorer we see that pwsh.exe is running. When i close this one, the command line also works again as intended.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25219371/145573240-0fa08d5e-6983-4328-bd17-951e1e1aa24b.png)\r\n",
