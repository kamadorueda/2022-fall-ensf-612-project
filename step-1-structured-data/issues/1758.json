  "body": "Paul Higinbotham:\nI found this while debugging a running workflow.  This method (GetLanguageModeCheckIfHasEverUsedConstrainedLanguage()) uses the ExecutionContext object obtained from LocalPipe.GetExecutionContextFromTLS(), but this can return a null value which is not checked.  The result is a null reference exception.  I only saw this on a workflow during a trace call that caught all exceptions so it is not noticed.  But this method should check for a null context and return the correct BindingRestrictions.\n",
