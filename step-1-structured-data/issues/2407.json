  "body": "Hi guys, I've got a list of email addresses in an excel spreadsheet.\n\nI run this script on the DC in AD Powershell, \n\nGet-Recipient -resultSize unlimited | select name -expand emailAddresses | where {$_.smtpAddress -match \"USERS EMAIL ADRESS\"} | Format-Table name, smtpaddress\n\nThis then returns a Distribution Group. I need that DG to be put into the spreadsheet alongside the email.\n\nI then run this script with the DG in it Set-DistributionGroup Distribution Group -EmailAddresses @{Remove=\u2019USERS EMAIL ADRESS\u2019}\n\nSo my question is, is there a way of automating this? I have over 100 email addresses and would quite like it to be done immediately.\n\nRegards,\n\nAdam.\n",
