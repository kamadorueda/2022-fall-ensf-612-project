  "body": "i know that debian10 is not yet ready, i'm opening this issue to have a referral for people using powershell on buster or maybe kali linux.\r\n\r\nissue #10080 also affects debian10: on debian buster/kali we have libcrypto.so.1.1 and libssl.so.1.1\r\n\r\nthe error i had using Invoke-Command against a remote windows host was:\r\nInvoke-Command : This parameter set requires WSMan, and no supported WSMan client library was found. WSMan is either not installed or unavailable for this system.\r\n\r\nand to me, having libssl1.1 installed, the proposed fix works:\r\n```ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0\r\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.0\r\n```\r\nof course if you have libssl1.0.2 you can:\r\n```ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcrypto.so.1.0.0\r\nln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libssl.so.1.0.0\r\n```",
