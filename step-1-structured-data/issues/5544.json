  "body": "Currently, there is no way to learn of the path-separator character(s) that must be used to separate the components of a path for a given provider, because `[System.Management.Automation.ProviderInfo]`, as returned by `Get-PSProvider`, has no such property.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of such information, users may be tempted to assume that `\\` and `/` can be universally - and interchangeably - used, which is _not necessarily_ true; for instance, the registry provider only properly supports `\\`, given that `/` is a valid char. in registry key names - see #5536\r\n\r\nFuture providers - or even existing third-party providers - could conceivably use completely different characters (of necessity).\r\n\r\nAdding a `[string[]]`-typed `.PathSeparator` property to `[System.Management.Automation.ProviderInfo]` would help.\r\n\r\nAdditional considerations:\r\n\r\n* Non-hierarchical providers such as the `Variable` and `Function` providers have no real need for a path separator: e.g., `Get-Item variable:PSHome` works just fine. In practice, these providers follow the `FileSystem` provider's example and allow interchangeable use of `/` and `\\`, and  tab completion even explicitly inserts these optional chars.: `/` on Unix, and `\\` on Windows.\r\n\r\n* Third-party implementers of providers will need to provide appropriate values for `.PathSeparator` too.\r\n\r\n* The name to give this new property is debatable, given that the .NET framework has already sown confusion around `[System.IO.Path]::DirectorySeparator` (the path-_component_ separator) vs. `[System.IO.Path]::PathSeparator` (the path-_environment-variable-entry_ separator). However, given that the term _directory_ is filesystem-specific and we're talking about abstractions here, my vote is still for `.PathSeparator`.\r\n\r\nDesired behavior\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> Get-PSProvider FileSystem | % PathSeparator\r\n\\\r\n/\r\n\r\n> Get-PSProvider Registry | % PathSeparator\r\n\\\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-rc\r\n```\r\n",

For what I have read in the code the best location to update the property would be in the `Start` method of each the provider. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

So I think we need another abstraction name.\r\n\r\nWhy? To me, the confusion stems only from `[System.IO.Path]::PathSeparator`, but I don't think we should worry about that - it's .NET's confusion, not PowerShell's.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, we're looking for the character that is used to separate item names that are sequenced to form a path - `PathSeparator` seems like the most intuitive choice to me.\r\n\r\nI guess `ItemSeparator` would work too, but to me it's preferable to mention the relevant concept in the name: a _path_ [of item names].\r\n\r\n> I'd expect that .Net Core `[System.IO.Path]::PathSeparator` transforms to `ItemSeparator`.\r\n\r\n`[System.IO.Path]::PathSeparator` has no relationship to providers per se, and shouldn't be reflected there - it's a character used by convention to separate _paths as a whole_ in a _reserved environment variable_ (and, as an aside, is itself a legal filename character on its respective platforms). Whether and where to represent this other separator in PowerShell too is a separate question; my name suggestion would be `PathVariableSeparator`.\r\n\r\n> On the other hand, we have `Join-Path`. If we had a `PathSeparator` parameter there, what would it mean? Again confuse.\r\n\r\nIn line with the new property, it would refer to the separator used to separate item names in a path - where is the confusion?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Agreed with using `PathVariableSeparator` or even something a degree more removed perhaps, like `PathVariableDelimiter` because its function is so completely different to PathSeparator; it's not separating portions of a path, it's usually a character that can't be used in a path at all, so it serves to clearly delimit individual values in the environment variable.",

      "body": "Thanks, @vexx32, but I suggest sticking with \"separator\" as the most familiar term (for which \"delimiter\" is a near-synonym with no clear distinction), because in the abstract the functionality is the same: \r\n\r\nA list or sequence (path)  is formed from entries, and a character is placed between those entries to mark their boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe entries just happen to be different entities:\r\n* In the case of `$env:PATH`, the entities happen to be filesystem paths themselves (and, as stated, strictly speaking you _can_ use `:` in filesystem paths on Unix, and `;` on Windows, but it's probably a bad idea).\r\n* In the case of a provider path, the entities happen to be item names (file/directory names, in the case of the filesystem provider)\r\n\r\n",
