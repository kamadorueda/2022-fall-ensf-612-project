This kind of surprised me.\r\n\r\nSo the question may actually be three-fold: 1) Why the switch to HttpClient? This is not an obvious problem at first glance... just a curiosity.  2) Why is performance so much different between HttpClient and WebRequest under Windows PowerShell, and 3) Why the slowdown in WebRequest from Windows PowerShell to PowerShell Core (may be an underlying DotNet Core question).",

I have a script that talks to the web server on a Siemens LOGO!8 PLC, it has a very peculiar authentication protocol and I recently discovered the HTTP requests during the handshake need to be sent over the same TCP connection or it doesn't work (obviously this isn't PowerShell's problem but just adding for context).\r\nOverall execution of the script in PS 7 was so much snappier than PS 5 that it didn't even occur to me there was a new TCP connection opened each time, although no SSL in my use case.\r\n\r\nThat said, _there is_ at least a documentation issue here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-restmethod?view=powershell-7.1\r\n>**-DisableKeepAlive**\r\n>Indicates that the cmdlet sets the KeepAlive value in the HTTP header to False.

KeepAlive establishes a persistent connection to the server to facilitate subsequent requests.\r\n\r\nWireshark shows no `Connection: Keep-Alive` header being sent by default (whereas PowerShell 5.1 does). And `Connection` cannot be specified via the `-Headers` parameter as a workaround either.\r\n\r\nAs previously suggested by @iSazonov I think caching `SocketsHttpHandler` per PS session / runspace would make sense, probably need a separate instance for each set of redirect settings as those get baked as part of the internal message handler chain. However it looks like `SocketsHttpHandler` does the heavy lifting internally as far as adapting to different proxy and retry handling settings. I don't know whether PS presents any special considerations as far as parallelism but believe the best practice with respect to `System.Net.Http.HttpClient` has always been to reuse the instances, or rather reuse the handler, even in highly parallel applications like ASP.NET.\r\n\r\nAlthough I'm not sure about _requiring_ the use of `WebRequestSession` to take advantage of connection pooling is a good idea though, the two concerns seem orthogonal.

We could use the same SocketsHttpHandler in (1) WebSession, (2) pipeline. First one is simple, universal and reliable. Second one is under question for me but we could investigate how this works in different scenarios and implement as an experimental feature.",

Most control to the end user wanting to optimise and covers for-each loops not just pipeline input.\r\n\r\nSo do something like overload GetHttpClient with the option to provide the SocketsHttpHandler. \r\n\r\nYou then might have a somewhat complex .NET object to create in your PowerShell at point of consumption to provide as an argument?\r\n\r\n`Invoke-WebRequest -Session $session`\r\n\r\nMany Cmdlets have a Credential and so there is a related Get-Credential Cmdlet.  \r\n\r\ne.g. `Get-ADUser -Credential (Get-Credential)`\r\n\r\nAlthough the following is fine, the syntax is not familiar: \r\n\r\n`$session = [System.Net.Http.SocketsHttpHandler]::new()` \r\n\r\nSomething like this might be more idiomatic?\r\n\r\n`$session = New-WebSession -SomeArgument someSetting`",
