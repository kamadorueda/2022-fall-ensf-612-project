  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nPowerShell Console has a \"suggestions framework\" that enables making suggestions to the user.  It currently has a [small set of suggestions](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/f17601298b87827a94ba029e2159399e1245c077/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/hostifaces/HostUtilities.cs#L61).  Suggestions are currently written directly to the console as it's meant only for interactive use.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nConsider either changing the output to use InformationStream or using a test hook to enable capturing the suggestion and validating it is working correctly.",
