  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nWhen running a script as a job using `Start-Job`, I'd like to pass all preference variables (like `$ProgressPreference`, `$ErrorActionPreference`,...) to the job scope. To do that, I need a list of all supported preference variables, as hardcoding this list or using `Get-Variable *Preference` is not a robust solution.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nExpose a class, possibly similar to `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.CommonParameters]`, where the preference variables are listed.",
