And I kept getting errors stating that the assembly of the same name was already loaded.\r\n\r\nTurns out, I had both of the assemblies listed in the Module Manifest `FileList` property, after removing them from there, the logic to add the correct assembly works fine.  Per this link, that property should be for inventory only, and should not process the files in the value: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/module/how-to-write-a-powershell-module-manifest?view=powershell-7#module-manifest-elements\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Assembly loading logic from  WinSCP.psm1\r\n$moduleRoot = Split-Path -Path $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path\r\nswitch ($PSVersionTable.PSEdition) {\r\n    \"Core\" {\r\n        #Add-Type -Path \"${moduleRoot}\\lib\\netstandard2.0\\WinSCPnet.dll\"\r\n        add-type -path ./Documents/github/WinSCP/WinSCP/lib/netstandard2.0/WinSCPnet.dll\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    \"Desktop\" {\r\n        Add-Type -Path \"${moduleRoot}\\lib\\net40\\WinSCPnet.dll\"\r\n        break;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    default {\r\n        Write-Error -Message \"Failed to find a compatiable WinSCP Assembly.\"\r\n        exit\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen the `FileList` property in the manifest has those files listed in the value, I get the \"Assembly with the same name is already loaded\" error\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52005101/90784555-67743c80-e2cf-11ea-9fb1-1c7961574e92.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/52005101/90784601-72c76800-e2cf-11ea-99cf-ba105a933393.png)\r\n\r\nif I remove the .dll values from that list, the logic works fine and the proper dll is loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNo processing of the files in the `FileList` module manifest property value.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIm not sure in what way, but he files are being executed or processed.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS /Users/thomas> $psversiontable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Darwin 20.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.0.0: Thu\u2026\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

I know there were some changes made to avoid loading native libraries from the FileList, but I think that may have also impacted cases like this (positively), so would be good to check just in case. \ud83d\ude42 ",
