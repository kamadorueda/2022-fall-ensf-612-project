It doesn't come up super often, and typically only comes up when implementing existing .NET classes without a default constructor (and there's nothing PS can really do about that). Also it's not unique to PS. The same syntax is lifted from C# pretty directly, and the concept of calling base constructors exists in many languages.",

      "body": "To build on @SeeminglyScience's comments with a **succinct summary of when you _must_ call `: base(...)` in a derived class' constructor in PowerShell (as well as in C#)**:\r\n\r\n* You _must_ call a base-class constructor explicitly with `: base(...)` if the base class lacks an accessible _parameterless_ constructor. (Of course, if other accessible base-class constructors exist, you _may_ call them.)\r\n\r\n* Conversely, if you do _not_ use `: base(...)`(and can get away with it), the (then by definition accessible) _parameterless_ base-class constructor is _implicitly_ called.\r\n\r\nAs such, the deciding factor is not whether the base class has a _default_ constructor, but whether there is an _accessible parameterless_ constructor - irrespective of whether this constructor is _implicit_ (the default constructor) or _explicit_, as it must be if the base class also defines _other_ constructors (which derived classes do _not_ inherit), by definition _with_ parameters.\r\n\r\n* In PowerShell, classes (which includes `enum`s) and their members are _invariably_ `public` and therefore accessible to anyone; PowerShell classes lack support for access modifiers altogether.\r\n\r\n   *  However, classes as a whole can _in effect_ be inaccessible due to existing in _different PowerShell scopes_ (which can be overcome with dot-sourcing for classes declared in _scripts_, and with `using module` for classes declared in _modules_).\r\n\r\n   * With respect to class _members_, PowerShell only supports _hiding_ members with the `hidden` keyword, which, however, doesn't prevent _access_ and is only honored by the PowerShell engine and select cmdlets (a notable exception is #9847).\r\n\r\n* In C#, the only way to make a base-class constructor _inaccessible_ to derived classes is by declaring it with one of the following access modifiers:\r\n\r\n  * `private` (the default), which makes it inaccessible to _all_ derived classes.\r\n  * `private protected` (C# 7.2+), which makes it inaccessible to derived classes _located in other assemblies_.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@p0W3RH311, given @SeeminglyScience's conclusion:\r\n\r\n> That's how the .NET runtime works and isn't something PowerShell can change.\r\n\r\nI think it makes sense to close this issue.\r\n\r\n",
