  "body": "Note: This problem may not often arise in practice, but there is no good reason for this inconsistency.\r\n\r\nThe simplified syntax for `Where-Object` and `ForEach-Object` introduced in v3 - called comparison and operation statement respectively - is meant to be just syntactic sugar that makes for less \"noisy\" commands, due to not requiring  a script block and operation on `$_` being implied.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the case of input objects that are _themselves collections_, the behaviors differ: script-block syntax performs _member enumeration_, whereas the simplified syntax does not.\r\n\r\nThat is, a given property `Foo` isn't automatically looked for on the _elements_ of an input object, if it happens to be a collection, unlike when `$_.Foo` is used in a script block.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the following Pester tests:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nDescribe \"Both script-block and operation/comparison-statement syntax perform member enumeration.\" {\r\n  BeforeAll {\r\n    $arr = ([pscustomobject] @{ prop = 1 }), ([pscustomobject] @{ prop = 2 })\r\n  }\r\n  It \"ForEach-Object\" {\r\n    $expected = 1, 2\r\n    # Note how $arr is sent as a *single object* through the pipeline\r\n    # and how the output should be a single array of the property values, \r\n    # courtesy of member enumeration.\r\n    , $arr | ForEach-Object { $_.prop } | Should -Be $expected\r\n    , $arr | ForEach-Object prop | Should -Be $expected    \r\n  }\r\n  It \"Where-Object\" {\r\n    # Note that the entire input array should be output as-is, as a single object.\r\n    , $arr | Where-Object { $_.prop -eq 1 } | Should -HaveCount 1\r\n    , $arr | Where-Object prop -eq 1 | Should -HaveCount 1\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe commands using operation / comparison syntax fail, because they don't apply member enumeration.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 6.2.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "The pipeline doesn't break down the array, the Where-Object command breaks down the array in its process block.   The pipeline passes the first collection item, which only contains one item.  Where-Object's simplified syntax is then only able to see one object, and that object does not contain the member you have requested.  The simplified syntax only works against members of the object, where as the scriptblock version is able to access the original pipeline object (iterated of course), for which now the scriptblock's operator is able to further iterate.\r\n",

In some ways though I think this is flawed and should not work.   At the point here where I am requesting property/member `b`, it doesn't exist, because I am testing an array of an array of hashtable/custom object's.   I should need to deliberately iterate the first level objects to get to properties stored in the second level.  I should have to do this, for consistency.\r\n\r\nSay for instance I had a list of lists.  Which way would be the right behavior there?   Should `[array]` have a special behavior as it mostly does now?",

      "body": "I don't think this issue is necessarily the right place to argue against the well established paradigm of member enumeration; it's been around for a long time now, and this issue is about bringing nonconformant parts of PS into line such that they behave as one might expect compared to alternate but generally equivalent methods.\r\n\r\nIf you had a list of lists, the member enumeration would generally be non functional. Since the top level list has all the properties that the second-level lists do, it would mask all their properties. Items stored in each of the second level lists would be masked from normal member enumeration until you start unwrapping the top level collection, e.g., with a pipeline.\r\n\r\n",
