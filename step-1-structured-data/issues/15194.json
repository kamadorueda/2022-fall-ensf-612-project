Like pwsh > launch script > change current pwsh process ThreadOptions > continue to execute script?\r\n",

Thus for WPF, we changed pwsh build process. Maybe it makes sense to ask in the MAUI repo.\r\n\r\nRegarding the fix in consolehost, I fear it will backfire. I'd rather expect to see an generic graphical host instead.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/11524380?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/PowerShell/GraphicalTools\">PowerShell/GraphicalTools</a></strong></div><div>Modules that mix PowerShell and GUIs/CUIs! - built on Avalonia and gui.cs - PowerShell/GraphicalTools</div></blockquote>",
