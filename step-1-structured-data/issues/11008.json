Under `DirectorySeparator` the path would be tested as a relative path to a file.  With the fix, this now works as it should.\r\n\r\nHad the file been `subFolder\\test1.ps1`, this test would also have failed, because the file would have executed, since it would have flagged as `DirectorySeparator`.\r\n",
