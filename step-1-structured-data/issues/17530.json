  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIf you attempt to copy a directory recursively into a subdirectory of the first directory you eventually encounter a path too long error.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Yes, I know that you shouldn't try doing this. I recently encountered an automated process that performed a similar function by accident, and thus how I discovered that PowerShell also behaves this same way.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> New-Item a/a -Type Directory\r\nPS> Copy-Item a a/a -Recurse\r\n<Probably a terminating error that you can't recursively copy a directory into itself>\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n~> mkdir a/a\r\n\r\n    Directory: /Users/coryknox/a\r\n\r\nUnixMode   User             Group                 LastWriteTime           Size Name\r\n--------   ----
