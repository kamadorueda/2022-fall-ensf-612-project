Since most hosts will already support `ReadLineAsSecureString`, it should use that as a fallback and just convert to a string.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation is going to be really painful to support for hosts that still need to run in 5.1 (like PSES)\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",

That way hosts that already support `ReadLineAsSecureString` will automatically support `ReadLineMaskedAsString` without having to compile for 7.1\r\n\r\n",
