  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nFrom time to time, I get the message when I open terminal. I would need to open github release page, find the matched version and install an MSI. The process is super inconvenient.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10512841/169763022-0f8ee7c9-663b-479d-93a0-d6fda6e783a0.png)\r\n\r\nReally appreciate it if I can install/update the package within terminal directly. Maybe we can add a command in the update message to inform user how to update PSCore within terminal.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
