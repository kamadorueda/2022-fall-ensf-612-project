Even in the above example, you can place important information instead of \"End\" string. (I believe that it is possible to write a script that will do this the same way in both versions.)\r\nCurrent optimization is really skipping all updates for 200 ms. It is simple and gives great performance. You ask to track last update. This will complicate the code and consume more resources. Given other issues with this cmdlet, this is not worth the effort.\r\n",

The only time you *don't* have to add the delay is if you don't care if the message shows the wrong step.  Or if you know **for sure** that there are no machines where one step will take under 200ms, and another will take a couple seconds. I guess what I'm getting at is, was performance really fixed if the only way to use it reliably is to add a delay?",
