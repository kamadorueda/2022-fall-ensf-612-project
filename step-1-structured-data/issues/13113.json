      "body": "@daxian-dbw @mklement0 Thank you for your responses. @vexx32, I ran the code you asked for and it was reallyyyyyyyyy long, so I didn't include it here. Is there a subset of that info you'd find useful?\r\n\r\nI read the SO article, and I agree, there are anti-patterns associated with curly braces. But my question still remains: why did it change from 5.1 to 7.0.2? Do any you have a more recent version of PS that could test this out on a DC? Since I created this issue, I have thus modified my code to use quotes instead of curly braces, and it works fine now.\r\n\r\nI guess I'm trying to understand if this is such a bad idea, why hasn't more recent versions of PS warned about this type of invocation? Why is the **documentation for [Get-ADUser](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-powershell-docs/blob/master/docset/windows/addsadministration/Get-ADUser.md)** still showing this (anti) pattern (see the end of [this section](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-powershell-docs/blob/master/docset/windows/addsadministration/Get-ADUser.md#-filter))?\r\n\r\nMaybe it's a breaking change in PS 7.0, or a breaking change in the ActiveDirectory module, or a completely unintentional side-effect. Let's call it what it is: a change/regression in the way the language is executed. If curly braces shouldn't be used at all for string interpolation (which they are in other constructs in PS, like naming variables), that's fine. Let's enforce it across the board. But if for this one function, it doesn't work how it's supposed to work everywhere else, then Get-ADUser needs to be fixed, or it should be updated to give an error on that type of construct. There shouldn't be one input with multiple types of output.\r\n\r\nSorry for the rant! I know there's a huge list of bugs and issues the coders are proposing every minute of the day, and it's a lot of work to assess which are truly bugs or just not writing proper code.",

      "body": "@tralston I believe it'll work just fine if you're on the latest version of Windows 10 and RSAT.  The AD module had to be updated for Core, but afaik it's not coming to Windows 7 (which looks like where your second screenshot is from).\r\n\r\n> Why is the **documentation for [Get-ADUser](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-powershell-docs/blob/master/docset/windows/addsadministration/Get-ADUser.md)** still showing this (anti) pattern (see the end of [this section](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windows-powershell-docs/blob/master/docset/windows/addsadministration/Get-ADUser.md#-filter))?\r\n\r\nThe original authors of the AD module seemed to think it was a good idea to pretend to support `ScriptBlock`s.  It's largely brought nothing but confusion though.  /cc @SteveL-MSFT I believe you worked on the Core port, any chance to get this pattern removed from the docs?\r\n\r\n> Let's call it what it is: a change/regression in the way the language is executed. If curly braces shouldn't be used at all for string interpolation (which they are in other constructs in PS, like naming variables), that's fine.\r\n\r\nSo basically, the parameter `Filter` is typed as a `string`.  So behind the scenes, the AD module is doing something like this (though oversimplified):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$myFilter = { thing -eq $otherThing }\r\n$asString = $myFilter.ToString()\r\n$asString -replace '\\$otherThing', $otherThing\r\n```\r\n\r\nNothing in the language actually changed, it's just their hack that broke. There's no actual support for scriptblocks, it's processed exactly the same as if you passed `Get-AdUser -Filter ' thing -eq $otherThing '` (which also shouldn't work but does because of their hack).",
