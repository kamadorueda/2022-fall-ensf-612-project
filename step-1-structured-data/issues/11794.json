  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user, I'd like for the CLI tool distribution of powershell to include icons so that I can configure Windows Terminal to display the PowerShell Core icon in tabs.  This would also be applicable to other console tools, like Conemu.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the latest distributions of the powershell CLI tool do not include icons.",
