  "body": "This allows runspace operators (for example) to look for or prevent PowerShell injection by calling a custom piece of code prior to the conversion happening.\n\nIt's unclear whether or not this change requires an update to the documentation. I couldn't, for example, find where PreCommandLookupAction (similar to this) is covered. This change may also warrant a note in the changelog.\n",
