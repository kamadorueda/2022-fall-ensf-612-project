A number of test changes needed to be made because some assertions were dropped in the 4x version of Pester.\r\nI have left the Restore-PSPester function in the case that someone would like to have the older version. This can certainly be removed if desired.",

It's one thing to make the tests work with 4.0, it is an entirely other thing to switch to the new syntax. switching all tests to the new syntax in this PR would make it hard to see what changes were necessary just to get it working with 4.0.",
