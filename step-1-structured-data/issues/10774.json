  "body": "`Write-Error -Exception` should allow you to report a custom error (by writing a custom `ErrorRecord` instance to the error stream) that wraps the given `System.Exception`[-derived] instance.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this appears to be broken, at least inside a `catch` block, where `Write-Error -Exception $_.Exception ...` unexpectedly seems to have the same effect as calling `Write-Error -ErrorRecord $_`, i.e. passing the PowerShell-supplied `ErrorRecord` instance _through_, while ignoring additional parameters such as `-Category` and `-ErrorId`.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, `Write-Error -Message ....` _is_ effective in creating a custom `ErrorRecord` with a custom category, error ID, ..., and, curiously, specifying the original error's _inner_ exception (if present) seems to work too (`Write-Error -Exception $_.Exception.InnerException ...`)\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# With $_.Exception.*InnerException*, it works.\r\n& { try { [int]::Parse('no') } catch { Write-Error -Exception $_.Exception.InnerException -ErrorId CustomErr 2>$null; $Error[0].FullyQualifiedErrorId } } | \r\n  Should -Be CustomErr\r\n\r\n# !! With just $_.Exception, it doesn't.\r\n& { try { [int]::Parse('no') } catch { Write-Error -Exception $_.Exception -ErrorId CustomErr 2>$null; $Error[0].FullyQualifiedErrorId } } | \r\n  Should -Be CustomError\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests should succeed.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe second test fails, because the resulting error record doesn't have the custom error ID:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected strings to be the same, but they were different.\r\nExpected length: 11\r\nActual length:   15\r\nStrings differ at index 0.\r\nExpected: 'CustomError'\r\nBut was:  'FormatException'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.4\r\n```\r\n",
