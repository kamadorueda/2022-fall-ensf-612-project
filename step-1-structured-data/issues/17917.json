  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nThe `$ErrorView` variable was introduced earlier than `$PSStyle`. But with `$PSStyle` containing configuration like `$PSStyle.Formatting` and `$PSStyle.Progress`, it feels to me the error view configuration should be moved to `$PSStyle` as well, for consistency and easier discoverability.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nDiscard the `$ErrorView` variable (breaking change), add the public property `ErrorView` to `System.Management.Automation.PSStyle`.",

Think about the scenario where PowerShell is hosted in a Windows GUI application.",

      "body": "Idea for softer transition without breaking change just yet: make `$ErrorView` getters and setters forward to `$PSStyle.ErrorView` with a deprecation warning, similarly how code libraries deprecate functions. Then we can fully remove it in another major release or next one. That way people who update regularly will get some time to adjust. ",
