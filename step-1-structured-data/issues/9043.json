  "body": "# Documentation Issue\r\n\r\nOne of the classes advantages is a possibility to reuse once developed classes in the future.\r\nI would like to find in the \"Powershell: about classes\" text an example of storing classes as separate files and including them by reference in the main ps-script. \r\nThe background idea: to collect future capable classes as files by script development and save time and notation length using only \"includes\".\r\nSuch an example would have an essential education influence on the readers community.",
