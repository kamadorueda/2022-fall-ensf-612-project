  "body": "Initial PR for #3961, to get the ball rolling.\r\n- [x] Update build so it can build and publish for the runtime linux-x64\r\n\r\nNow that openSUSE.42.1 is decommissioned, comparing to updating our build to support SUSE 42.2, it's better to spend our effort on moving toward the generic Linux package.\r\n\r\nThis PR focuses on enabling build/publish with 'linux-x64'. I also removed `win10-x64` and `win81-x64` RID's given that we produce a single windows package now.\r\nI tried `Start-PSPackage` on Ubuntu after building with the changes of this PR, and the generated package works fine.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to figure out how to generate single DEB/RPM packages that work for all supported Linux distros.",

Remove dependencies we now include during packaging ( according to DotNet Core many native libs will be included when you publish)\r\n2. Test the package on applicable platforms\r\n3. Adjust the package based on the result and repeat 2\r\n",
