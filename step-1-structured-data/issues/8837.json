  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI came across this when looking at the alerts for this project on LGTM.com (full disclosure: I work on the C# analysis there). The existing check `splitName.Length < 0` is redundant, and I believe it should have been `splitName.Length == 0`, since the constructor of `PSSnapinQualifiedName` expects an array of length 1 or 2.\r\n\r\nYou can see the original alert on LGTM.com here: https://lgtm.com/projects/g/PowerShell/PowerShell/alerts/?mode=tree&ruleFocus=1506101336231\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nTom",
