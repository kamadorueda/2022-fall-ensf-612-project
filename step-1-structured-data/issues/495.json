We also use the native host today for hosting different CLRs (i.e. powershell -version 2) and we need to close on whether this is still needed. \n\nThe room generally agrees that we should leave the native host be for FullCLR PowerShell until we have more time to mess around with the managed host. No real reason to get rid of the native host today. \n",
