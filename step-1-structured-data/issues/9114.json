  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThe behavior between New-ModuleManifest, Update-ModuleManifest and Test-ModuleManifest seems inconsistent.\r\n\r\n- New-ModuleManifest does not check whether or not the values entered by a user are correct. This means that a user can create an invalid manifest file using this cmdlet on which Test-ModuleManifest will fail.\r\n\r\n- Update-ModuleManifest uses Test-ModuleManifest to check certain fields in the manifest file that the user is updating. These values are not necessarily values passed to Update-ModuleManifest but rather values which are already present in the manifest file. Update-ModuleManifest also adds some extra checks that Test-ModuleManifest does not do (ex : ExternalModuleDependencies need to be present under RequiredModules or NestedModules)\r\n\r\n- Test-ModuleManifest does not check the Private data section at all.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n- Test-ModuleManifest should include all checks currently in this cmdlet and in Update-ModuleManifest that are not present in Test-ModuleManifest. This would allow us to remove a lot of extra checks present in Update-ModuleManifest (PowerShellGet issue but still important to mention here)\r\n\r\n- Update-ModuleManifest solely relies on Test-ModuleManifest for its checks.\r\n\r\n- New-ModuleManifest uses Test-ModuleManifest to check for invalid values. This would be a breaking change since users would no longer be able to create invalid manifest files via this cmdlet. However I think it would be a minor breaking change since it's hard to see the use case for automating the creation of manifest files.\r\n",

I feel like I'm back in 1999 reading CfEngine documentation written by a physicist from CERN laboratories who just finished his PhD in particle physics.  For example, what is a RootModule?  That took me a week to understand, and there are so few clean open source PowerShell modules to use as reference.  Even you guys at Microsoft write your junk in C# instead of PowerShell, so how is somebody supposed to learn how to do it the right way?  The official documentation for `New-modulemanifest` has RootModule commented out for example.\r\n\r\nGoing back to the \"no examples\" comment, I was completely perplexed that you are concerned about breaking backward compatibility for a command I could find no good examples for how to use in the first place.\r\n\r\nWhich is why I think the focus should be, rather than on maintaining backward compatibility, focusing on user stories and _adding features_ that make module development easier.

Right above the commented out value field though is a comment explaining what it is for, and that is also shown in the `New-ModuleManifest` documentation, which made me surprised that it took you a week to understand. In your mind, now that you know what `RootModule` is for, what would have made that learning hurdle easier to get over? Is having `RootModule` at the top of the manifest with the comment explaining what it is for not clear enough? It mentions \"Script module\" and \"binary module\". If you google \"script module\", the second link takes you to the [How to write a PowerShell script module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/developer/module/how-to-write-a-powershell-script-module) docs. Have you seen those documents? Did you come to the manifest as the starting point for your module, or after you had created a script module? There are a lot of questions here, I know, but I'm hoping to get a better idea of what might be missing.\r\n\r\nI wonder if it might be helpful if in a manifest generated by `New-ModuleManifest` there was a comment that said \"If you haven't created a PowerShell module before, read this first: ...\" with a hyperlink.\r\n\r\n",

Note that I find the Visual Studio PowerShell Tools extension has gotten in the way for me doing this in the past, to the point where I just removed it because I didn't have time to track down the issues, and resolving them wasn't as important to me as being able to debug and step through my C# code, either in `pwsh` if I'm working on open source PowerShell or in binary modules I have authored. I've also done this in the past using Visual Studio 2017 (and probably 2015 as well -- been a while, can't quite remember).\r\n\r\n> * Lack of way to force a global \"on `Import-Module`\" hook within C#, since the C# cmdlets API does not have a hook for things to be loaded on module import.\r\n\r\nIf you have a public class that implements `IModuleAssemblyInitializer`, its `OnImport` method will get called at module load time. PowerShell 3.0 and later.\r\n\r\n> * No guidance on how to integrate traditional logging frameworks like log4net, NLog, Serilog, etc. or cloud-based logging frameworks like Datadog for centralized log collection. - Forget writing enterprise code where people are accountible for fixing errors in scripts, because there is no centralized way to collect such errors.\r\n\r\nSee [this RFC on using ScriptBlock message handlers to facilitate centralized message management](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/issues/196).\r\n",

PowerShell 3.0 and later.\r\n\r\nThanks; we're going to give this a shot.  What we resorted to doing instead was creating an abstract class `CompanyNameCmdletsBase` and having a static constructor that initializes the logging framework; the first time a cmdlet accesses a base class member (e.g., `protected ILog Log {get; set;}`), it initializes it.  This works due to the fact static constructors are guaranteed to be thread-safe, but it's messy in that we have to have our plumbing code all over the place, and no way to know which Cmdlet will be the first to call the initialization logic (multiple entry points creates unnecessary bounded non-determinism).",
