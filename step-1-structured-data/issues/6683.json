  "body": "Follow-up from #6676:\r\n\r\nA single catch-all error is currently reported for problems relating to a module manifest's nonempty `RootModule` entry:\r\n\r\n* ~~The `RootModule` entry has no filename extension~~ _Update_: specifying `.psm1` should _not_ be a requirement - see #8388\r\n* It does have extension `.psm1`, but the referenced file doesn't exist.\r\n* ~~The `*.psd1` file is not located in a folder named for its base name (e.g., `test.psd1` must be inside a folder named `test`)~~ _Update_: Such a test isn't actually being performed - see #8391\r\n\r\nThe unhelpful current error message:\r\n\r\n>    Test-ModuleManifest : The module manifest 'foo.psd1' could not be processed because it is not a valid PowerShell module manifest file. Remove the elements that are not permitted: /path/to/foo.psd1\r\n\r\nIt's probably worth checking if all error scenarios have specific, helpful error messages.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the behavior regarding requiring the extension to be specified may have changed compared to Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on macOS 10.13.4\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1709, OS Build: 16299.371)\r\n```\r\n",

This caching service is vulnerable to attack, as explained by me and summarized in #6818",
