  "body": "This is to resolve #5269\r\n\r\nWhen get-childitem is ended with * and -recurse, we only include the parent path as search path if the given path is a itemcontainer. We will return null if the parent directory only contains 1 sub folder with no sub folder under that folder. As if the parent folder only contains 1 subfolder, \"*\" will be mapped to that subfolder, and since it doesn't contain any subfolder, return is null.\r\n\r\nHowever, the following scenario should also be included:\r\nGiven path is not a itemcontainer but -file parameter is specified \r\n\r\n$Path='C:\\temp'\r\nmd \"$Path\\TestPS\"\r\nmd \"$Path\\TestPS\\D1\"\r\n\r\n\"Test\" > \"$Path\\TestPS\\D1\\File1.txt\"\r\nget-childitem -path \"$Path\\TestPS\" -File -Recurse \r\n\r\nBefore fix:\r\nreturns nothing\r\n\r\nAfter fix:\r\nFile1.txt will be returned.\r\n",
