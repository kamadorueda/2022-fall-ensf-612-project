If we ever have another callback, we are going to bump into the same problem.\r\n\r\nIt's a callback that is intended to be able to be called by anyone who needs to display (or otherwise retrieve) the user's prompt string.  That's why it should be documented as any other command imo, with just a \"also see\" link to `about_Prompts`.  Same for `TabExpansion2` which is a similar callback (with an even stronger case since it has parameters).\r\n\r\n> OTOH, maybe we never get another one, as `PROMPT` itself should an event handler for `Idle` rather than a callback.\r\n\r\nAll the `prompt` function does is return a string, the caller is responsible for how it's displayed.  It can't be an event handler because it doesn't make sense for multiple handlers to be registered, and it wouldn't be able to be raised outside of the event handler class.  \r\n\r\nAlso not important but it doesn't get invoked on `Idle`.  When and how it's invoked is determined by the current `PSHost` typically.  Fun fact, the `OnIdle` event will actually fire even in the middle of `PSConsoleReadLine.ReadLine`.\r\n\r\n",
