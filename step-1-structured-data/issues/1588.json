  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\n\n$s = New-PSSession .\n## Expected behavior\n\nCreates a session\n## Actual behavior\n\nFails to create a session\n## Root Cause:\n\nA new function pointer was added to System.Management.Automation.Remoting.WSManPluginEntryDelegates and WSManPluginEntryDelegatesInternal, but was not added to the corresponding unmanaged structure (PwrshPluginWkr_Ptrs) in pwrshplugindefs.h in the WinRM Plugin code. This led to a buffer overrun when the reverse PInvoke code copied an extra 8 bytes of data (the extra function pointer) beyond the end of the unmanaged structure. The fix is to add an extra pointer to the end of the unmanaged structure so that they become byte-for-byte aligned once more.\n",
