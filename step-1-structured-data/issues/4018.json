  "body": "Currently it is not obvious when PowerShell takes a dependency on a new version of dotnet, which can cause the build to fail.  It would be great if Start-PSBuild would check dotnet existing and required versions and provide a notification when the existing version is out of date.  The notification can tell the user how to update:\r\na) Remove the old dotnet version\r\nb) Run Install-Dotnet or Start-PSBootstrap",
