      "body": "There are actually 2 different issues here: Thomas's issue and mine.\r\n\r\nI think Thomas's issue is the classic known issue for PSReadLine caused by the change in the spelling (capital L). Also you must use `Update-Help -Force` to ensure that it downloads any files. See https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/updating-help-for-the-psreadline-module-in-windows-powershell-5-1/ for instructions to fix.\r\n\r\nMy issue is that I had two about_PSReadLine files installed on my system and `Get-Help` only displays the summary view when there is more than one help topic available. This is expected behavior for `Get-Help`. The question is how did I get two copies of that file? Deleting the old (lowercase) file fixed my problem.",
