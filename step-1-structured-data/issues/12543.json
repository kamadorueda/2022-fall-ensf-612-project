  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure if this is the right location for a function suggestion to be part of powershell but it surprised me that there is no `Set-ConsoleTitle` function. In a DOS console you can set the the title via `` title 'Your cool tab' &amp; cmd `` and was hoping for a similar function in Powershell but then to find that it does not exist but can be set via `$host.ui.rawui.set_WindowTitle(string)`\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of website suggesting to make your own Function and Alias but I think it should be part Powershell itself.\r\n\r\nIt is *VERY* useful to use when you have loads of console instances that you to identify easily. \r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nFunction Set-ConsoleTitle {\r\n  Param ([string]$value)\r\n  $host.ui.rawui.set_WindowTitle($value)\r\n}\r\nSet-Alias title Set-ConsoleTitle # Would make it behave similarly as in a DOS console\r\n```\r\n",

Maybe you want support for ShouldProcess, or a limit on the string length. Maybe you want to save the current title and have a parameter that lets you revert? Microsoft already gives you a way to achieve this goal.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$host.ui.RawUI.WindowTitle = \"PS 5.1\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnything else around that or beyond that, can be up to the user and/or community.",
