New process is still not clear for me - who and how should process `Needs-Triage`? We could automatically set only `Needs-Triage` and after triage (or I could does this independently leaving removing `Needs-Triage` to WGs) manually set `Issue-Question` for minor issues, `Issue-Bug` for bugs and `Issue-Enhancement` for new functionality.",
