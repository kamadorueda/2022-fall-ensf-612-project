  "body": "With this change, `Start-PSBuild` only builds the managed code.  Since the native code rarely changes, the script picks it up from the currently running PowerShell.  Expectation is that the developer is running latest PowerShell.  If there is a need to build the native binaries, user will run `Start-PSBootStrap -BuildNative` at least once to ensure the native build tools (and Win10 SDK on Windows) gets installed.  Then `Start-PSBuild -BuildNative` is run to explicitly build the native sources.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3014",

I think in general, the engineering team will know if the native binaries need to be rebuilt and will explicitly do so for a release, otherwise I expect we won't be making many changes to the native code so it won't need to be built much",
