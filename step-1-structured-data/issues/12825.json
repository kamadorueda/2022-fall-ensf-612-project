Getting the formatter to *maybe* start a new format scheme *maybe* continue the previous one would be a decent chunk of effort in a already complicated system.\r\n1. That would require checking the properties of every single item instead of just the first of each type.  For the folks already making sure the objects they emit have the same properties this would be a huge performance hit.\r\n\r\nWhile I think the best practice of similar shaped objects is a good enough reason, there are also some pretty significant technical challenges.\r\n",
