  "body": "1. `ConvertFrom-Markdown e:\\powershell\\readme.md` throws error: `A positional parameter cannot be found that accepts argument 'E:\\PowerShell\\README.md'`. I think it should work.\r\n\r\n2. `ConvertFrom-Markdown -Path E:\\PowerShell\\README.md | Show-Markdown` fails with this error: `Show-Markdown : The property VT100EncodedString of the given object is null or empty.` So, `ConvertFrom-Markdown` by default only populates HTML, while `Show-Markdown` by default show VT100. That feels very inconsistent to me.",

      "body": "yeah, the architecture of these commands is wrong.\r\n\r\nI would expect that if I say to convert markdown `-AsVT100EncodedString` that I should get *just* the vt encoded string out. I should not need Show-Markdown at that point.  Alternatively, Show-Markdown shouldn't need ConvertFrom-Markdown, and ConvertFrom-Markdown doesn't need that other output.\r\n\r\nI still want the HTML option for ConvertFrom-Markdown -- but this is just confusing.",
