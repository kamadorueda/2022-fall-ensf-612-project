  "body": ".NET Core again supports the APIs that New-EventLog and similar used to use, so we can bring back some of the cmdlets. While the *-WinEvent cmdlets are the replacement for the EventLog cmdlets in general, there is no equivalent functionality to create your own eventlog and write events to it.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[D:\\Lee\\Cookbook4\\windows-powershell-cookbook-4e]\r\nPS:52 > [system.diagnostics.eventlog] | gm -static\r\n\r\n   TypeName: System.Diagnostics.EventLog\r\n\r\nName                  MemberType Definition\r\nCreateEventSource     Method     static void CreateEventSource(string source,\r\nDelete                Method     static void Delete(string logName), static v\r\nDeleteEventSource     Method     static void DeleteEventSource(string source)\r\nEquals                Method     static bool Equals(System.Object objA, Syste\r\nExists                Method     static bool Exists(string logName), static b\r\nGetEventLogs          Method     static System.Diagnostics.EventLog[] GetEven\r\nLogNameFromSourceName Method     static string LogNameFromSourceName(string s\r\nnew                   Method     System.Diagnostics.EventLog new(), System.Di\r\nReferenceEquals       Method     static bool ReferenceEquals(System.Object ob\r\nSourceExists          Method     static bool SourceExists(string source), sta\r\nWriteEntry            Method     static void WriteEntry(string source, string\r\nWriteEvent            Method     static void WriteEvent(string source, System\r\n```",

At the bare minimum, we would need to:\r\n\r\n- update `csproj` to get the thing to compile\r\n- Fix the style issues found during compilation\r\n- Create extensive testing for the cmdlets\r\n\r\nThis does not seem like an overriding priority, so it would be useful if folks could help us understand the importance of this in the real world.",
