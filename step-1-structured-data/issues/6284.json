SSH users are probably more familiar and comfortable with `ssh user@hostname`, so it seems we should support `New-PSSession -Hostname user@hostname` (unfortunately, it would be a breaking change to default to `-Hostname` instead of `-Computername` to support this as a positional parameter)\r\n\r\ncc @PaulHigin @joeyaiello ",
