      "body": "@R030t1 the need to install PSCore6 system wide was probably just a simplification of the bootstrapping process and it could be updated to just rely on the zip for single user install rather than require elevation (on Win10 anyways).  However, on downlevel systems (older than Win10) there are some pre-requisites that need to be installed before PSCore6 works which require Windows Updates which would still require elevation so perhaps it's ok to leave it as-is unless it's a huge burden.",
