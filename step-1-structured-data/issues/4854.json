  "body": "I would like to propose option type support for PowerShell, similar to what [F# has](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/posts/the-option-type/).\r\n\r\nAn example scenario involves Active Directory automation tool. The tool proceeds to create or modify user accounts based on given input. \r\n\r\nFor each AD attribute; if no value has been given, skip the attribute. If a value has been given, check if it is null. If the value is null, clear the attribute. If a proper value has been given, set the attribute to given value.\r\n\r\nThe above check would be trivial if PowerShell had support for F# -like option types. Right now the tool uses PowerShell 5 classes, an example below.\r\n\r\n`class SingleValueStringProperty {\r\n    [bool] $Clear\r\n    [string] $Value\r\n}`\r\n\r\nThese classes exist for single value string, multi value string, single value int, single value bool and single value datetime. \r\n\r\nFrankly, it's not very intuitive.",
