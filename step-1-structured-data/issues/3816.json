In my scenario, I have some PowerShell scripts documented in Confluence as part of developer on-boarding.  Confluence saves all documentation with <kbd>LF</kbd> and so when I paste a script from Confluence into PowerShell, it reverses the whole script.\r\n\r\nIn addition, I tried running `Update-Module PSReadLine` based on @lzybkr  saying this is a PSReadLine issue, and I got the following error:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS D:\\Users\\John.Zabroski> update-module PSReadLine\r\nUpdate-Module: Module 'PSReadLine' was not installed by using Install-Module, so it cannot be updated.\r\n```",
