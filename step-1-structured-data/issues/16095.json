I am trying to use this command to capture the compile and clone process. The attached document called buildOutput.txt has the expected results but when rerunning my script the second time it did not log anywhere near the same data as the first log. buildOutput2.txt does not contain the cloning or compiling process shown in the first screen shot. The results contained in the log file are not consistent each time I run the power shell script.\r\n[buildOutput.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/7164661/buildOutput.txt)\r\n[buildOutput2.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/7164663/buildOutput2.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\nStart-Transcript  -Force -Path  $logfile\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nSee Attached buildOuput.txt\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nSee attached buildOutput2.txt file\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNo error returned\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value                                                                                                                                     \r\n----                           -----                                                                                                                                     \r\nPSVersion                      5.1.19041.1151                                                                                                                            \r\nPSEdition                      Desktop                                                                                                                                   \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                                                   \r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.19041.1151                                                                                                                           \r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000                                                                                                                           \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                                                       \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                                                       \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\nNone\r\n",

Execute my powershell script that will use Start-Transcript and Stop-Transcript to log\r\n  3.  When the script complete close the command prompt window\r\n  4.  Repeat steps 1 thru 3 and everything works fine\r\n\r\nIf I don\u2019t close the Command prompt window and rerun my powershell script the log file does not always contain all the information that was display in the terminal window.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nEd L Wolf\r\nTechnical Advisor - Embedded Software\r\n812-377-0831\r\n***@***.***\r\nCummins Inc.\r\nMail Code: C7004\r\n1460 National Road\r\nColumbus, Indiana 47201\r\nUnited States\r\n\r\nFrom: Ilya ***@***.***>\r\nSent: Wednesday, September 15, 2021 12:09 AM\r\nTo: PowerShell/PowerShell ***@***.***>\r\nCc: Ed L Wolf ***@***.***>; Author ***@***.***>\r\nSubject: Re: [PowerShell/PowerShell] Powershell Start-Transcript does not log the same information each time it is ran (#16095)\r\n\r\nEXTERNAL SENDER: This email originated outside of Cummins.
