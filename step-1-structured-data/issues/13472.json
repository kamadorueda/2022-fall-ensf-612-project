  "body": "So the issue I am having is that in the latest release of Powershell 7 Preview when I attempt to run executables, like ssh, or to navigate to some subdirectories they are not registering as extant. Obviously, if Powershell feels that the directory doesn't exist then it will not execute any of the binaries inside the directory either, which is how I found this in the first place.  At first, I thought this might some artifact of my custom user profile, so I removed it but I was still able to reproduce the behavior, Here is what I am seeing.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```none\r\nenter cd and the path that you wish to navigate to\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\andyf> cd C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\OpenSSH\\\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\System32\\OpenSSH>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS C:\\Users\\andyf> cd C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\OpenSSH\\\r\nSet-Location: Cannot find path 'C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\OpenSSH\\' because it does not exist.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\nThis is the output from Preview 6, where the action does not work.\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS C:\\Users\\andyf> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is the same data from Preview 5 where the action does work:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\System32\\OpenSSH> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0-preview.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0-preview.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",

I think this can occur for example when your PWD has been deleted underneath PowerShell.\r\n\r\n",
