      "body": "Oh, that explains it, I see.\r\n\r\nYou're replacing `'n` -- in a console, that's fine, because it generally won't bother to include the `` `r`` carriage return that most files have. On Windows in most cases (unless you go out of your way to avoid it / use an editor that's configured to avoid it) you will have `` `r`n`` as the line endings in files rather than just `` `n``.\r\n\r\nIf you change your ``.Split(\"`n\")`` to something like `-split '\\r?\\n'` it should be safe on pretty much every modern platform (most use `\\n` or `\\r\\n` as line endings in files, and that pattern matches both).\r\n\r\nWhat's happening is that the newline is being removed in the split, but the carriage returns are not, so when you do that replace, it ends in a `` `r``, which triggers the console to move back to the start of the line and keep writing characters -- effectively overwriting and hiding the beginning characters in the string from your view.",
