  "body": "If one currently uses practically any keyword (even `in`) in classes as method names, a meaningless error is displayed.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS C:\\> class crazy { param($a) {} }\r\nAt line:1 char:14\r\n+ class crazy { param($a) {} }\r\n+              ~\r\nMissing closing '}' in statement block or type definition.\r\nAt line:1 char:28\r\n+ class crazy { param($a) {} }\r\n+                            ~\r\nUnexpected token '}' in expression or statement.\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : MissingEndCurlyBrace\r\n```\r\nSee #2217.  I really think there is no reason these are reserved from method names.\r\n\r\nWhile the error message could be improved, this is inconsistent behavior from other parts of the PowerShell language.  For instance, while `CATCH` is prevented as a method name, I can use `CATCH` as a function name, because `CATCH` is only a keyword in certain context's.   `CATCH` will never likely be a keyword in the context of class definitions, and is not a keyword for the purpose of method invocations.\r\n\r\nYes, I understand that one would need to make that declaration, in documentation, so it would be final.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, some items, namely the `param` keyword, are treated different inside a method than it is inside some other blocks.  In a function's 'BEGIN' / 'END' / 'PROCESS' block, `param` is treated as a function, while in the main body, its a keyword.  In a method, its an error. (at least its got a meaningful error message at this point, thank-you.)",
