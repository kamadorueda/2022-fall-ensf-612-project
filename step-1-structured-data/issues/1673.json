  "body": "I developed module [MarkdownLinkCheck](https://github.com/vors/MarkdownLinkCheck) fully on OS X. To my great surprise, I didn't encounter any cross-platform problems when I tested the result on inbox Windows PS version. \nIt's particularly remarkable, because there is a binary part (netstandard assembly) in the package, but it works fine on full framework.\n\nToday I tried to publish the module to PSGallery and it turns out to be **the only place** in the whole development cycle that required me to hop back to a windows machine.\n\nHere is the result that I got on OS X:\n\n```\nPS /Users/vors/dev/MarkdownLinkCheck> Publish-Module -Name MarkdownLinkCheck -Verbose -RequiredVersion 0.1.0                                 \nPublish-Module : Publish-Module is not supported on Nano Server and PowerShellCore.\nAt line:1 char:1\n+ Publish-Module -Name MarkdownLinkCheck -Verbose -RequiredVersion 0.1. ...\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (System.Manageme....PSScriptCmdlet:PSScriptCmdlet) [Publish-Module], InvalidOperationExcept \n   ion\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PublishModuleIsNotSupportedOnNanoServer,Publish-Module\n```\n\ncc @raghushantha @quoctruong @KrishnaV-MSFT \n",
