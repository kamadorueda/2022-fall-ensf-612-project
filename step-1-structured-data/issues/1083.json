      "body": "The big question in UX sync is whether it's an egregious breaking change to make the default behavior of `Set-Location` to be `Set-Location ~` instead of `Set-Location .`\n\nGeneral sentiment was that, while this is definitely a breaking change, there's an expectation that script writers would not have intended to use `Set-Location` as shorthand for `Set-Location .`. We can gather feedback on Aug17 for whether or not people want this change (or if it breaks some pattern we didn't expect). \n\nThere's also a desire to discuss `cd -`, but UX sync agrees that it can be done in the future.\n",
