  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```\r\nNOTE: Only validated this on a Linux host, but suspect it would be the same on Windows.\r\n\r\n- Logon to a Linux endpoint.\r\n- Set the HOME env var to a RO location (Read or Read/Execute).\r\n- Launch pwsh\r\n\r\nInterestingly, this seems to be caused by the fact that the PSREADLINE history file cannot be written.  However, if this is the case, the failure should be graceful and not halt the shell.  Further, the exception thrown is not indicative of the reason why pwsh is not loading.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\npwsh should load as exected.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```\r\nReceive the following error:\r\nThe shell cannot be started. A failure occurred during initialization:\r\nThe static PrimaryRunspace property can only be set once, and has already been set.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0\r\nOS                             Linux 3.10.0-693.11.6.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Thu Dec 28 14:23:39 EST 2017\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
