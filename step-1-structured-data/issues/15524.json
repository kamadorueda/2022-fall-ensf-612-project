  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n```powershell\r\nfor ($remaining = 3; $remaining -gt 0; $remaining -= 3)\r\n{\r\n    Write-Progress -Activity \"Demonstrating 0% complete = 100% complete...\" -PercentComplete 0 -SecondsRemaining $remaining\r\n    Start-Sleep -Seconds $remaining\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nAn empty progress bar (black) is displayed as is done by PowerShell 7.1 and earlier. (I'm also a bit surprised this wasn't caught by automated UX tests.)\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nThe progress bar is yellow all the way across. The black portion of the bar is correctly sized for 1% or more complete in the cases I've spot checked.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n```none\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
