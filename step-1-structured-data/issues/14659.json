  "body": "For example, I prefer using [`exa`](https://the.exa.website/) instead of `ls` or `Get-ChildItem`. I therefore wrote the following line in my PowerShell profile:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nNew-Alias -Name ls -Value exa\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, when I run `ls` after that, the output doesn't contain colors. The output does contain colors when running `exa` directly.\r\n\r\nDoes alias affect isatty detection (which I suspect might be the culprit)?",
