      "body": "Thanks, @kasini3000  and @StevenBucher98:\r\n\r\nI realized that I was inadvertently running the x64 version of PowerShell on my M1 (ARM64) Mac (using the Rosetta 2 emulation environment), and it seems that the problem only occurs there.\r\n\r\n * As an aside: This happened because the installation script currently isn't ARM-aware on non-Windows platforms:\r\n   * #17663\r\n\r\nSince this is an exotic and ill-advised setup, I presume it isn't worth pursuing, so I'm closing this.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for `1..1e2 | % { pwsh -nop -c '\"hi\"' }` not working for you, @StevenBucher98:\r\nThis implies that you've either turned off the `PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` experimental feature or you've set `$PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing` to `Legacy`.\r\n\r\n * I was going to suggest `1..1e2 | % { pwsh -nop -c  { \"hi\" } }` as the simplest (albeit slower) workaround, which caused me to stumble upon this:\r\n    * #17665\r\n",
