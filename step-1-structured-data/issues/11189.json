  "body": "The PSv3+ unified handling of scalars and collections brought the ability to both call `.Count` on a scalar and index into a scalar (with only `[0]` and `[-1]` being meaningful indices); e.g.:\r\n`(42).Count` and `(42)[0]`)\r\n\r\nWith `XmlNode` instances this works with `.Count`, but not with indexing, which is an inconsistency that should be resolved.\r\n\r\n_Update_: `XmlElement` instances have a type-native indexer that accepts a _string_, i.e. the _name of a child element_. While that indexer should remain available (even though PowerShell's convenient dot notation makes it virtually unnecessary), a _numeric_ index should be interpreted as with other scalars. Given that XML element names by definition must not start with _digits_, there is no risk of conflict, and no backward-compatibility concern.\r\nIt is worth generalizing this change for all types as follows: if a type has a native  indexer with an argument type _other than_ `object` or `index`, conceive of PowerShell's positional indexer as an `int`-specific overload that is selected whenever the indexer is called with an `int` argument.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# OK: Indexing works with 2+ sibling elements, because PowerShell returns\r\n#     the 'bar' child elements as an *array*, where indexing works.\r\n([xml] '<foo><bar id=\"1\"/><bar/></foo>').foo.bar[0].id | Should -Be '1'\r\n\r\n# Broken: A single element cannot be indexed into, because the single 'bar' child\r\n#         is returned as itself, a System.Xm.XmlElement instance whose *type-native\r\n#         indexer* preempts PowerShell's automatic indexer - even though the\r\n#          type-native indexer only supports *strings* (child element names).\r\n([xml] '<foo><bar id=\"1\"/></foo>').foo.bar[0].id | Should -Be '1'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe 2nd test fails, because indexing into the single `XmlElement` instance failed quietly:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected 1, but got $null.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs an aside: The  type-native indexer works, but offers no benefit over PowerShell's dot notation, and is also limited to returning the _first_ child by the given name.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Access child element <bar> via the type-native indexer, ['bar']\r\n# Using `foo.bar.id` would be simpler.\r\n# Also, the type-native indexer doesn't allow returning *multiple* children by that name.\r\n([xml] '<foo><bar id=\"1\"/></foo>').foo['bar'].id | Should -Be 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.6\r\n```\r\n",

The more special rules there are around very specific niche cases the harder it is to figure out what something does.  It becomes another situation where someone asks \"why does x do blank but y does blank\" and the answer is because \"it's hard coded to do that for that one thing\".\r\n\r\n> * it is the _current_ behavior  that is hard to reason about: the native indexer is little-known (and provides no benefit over the widely known and used dot notation).\r\n\r\nIf it's anything like the dictionary key-value property binder, the index notation is likely a lot faster, and one could argue it describes intent better (the latter being admittedly subjective). Plenty of folks (including myself) insist on using the indexer directly for dictionaries in any projects they maintain.\r\n\r\n> * the current behavior prevents unified handling of XML elements with situationally varying child-element counts.\r\n>\r\n> Note that hashtables (dictionaries), strings, and XML elements already are all special-cased in general, in that PowerShell (sensibly) doesn't enumerate them, despite their implementing `IEnumerable`.\r\n\r\nThose are *mostly* dictating the behavior of an *archetype* of object though.  Dictionaries, strings, etc.  Yeah XML and `DataTable`'s are thrown in too, but if that was proposed today I'd be against that as well.\r\n\r\n> Users likely don't expect a single `XmlElement` to be indexable (it certainly was news to me), except in the treat-a-scalar-as-a-collection-of-one sense.\r\n\r\nYeah most people probably will expect `[0]` to work, that's not really my issue with it. The problem is when they go to try it on a different type, find out that it doesn't work, and then start analyzing the two types to figure out why one works and why the other doesn't.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, there's already plenty of examples of that all throughout the engine, but that's exactly why I don't want to see more. Any time a behavior question is answered with \"because of a line in the source\" it's incredibly alienating to folks trying to actually understand the rules of the language.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I wouldn't be surprised if the PS team disagrees with me for this scenario specifically.  `XmlElement` is already more special cased than *almost* any other type, it even has it's own internal `Adapter`.  So realistically, more fuel on that fire probably isn't the worst thing.",
