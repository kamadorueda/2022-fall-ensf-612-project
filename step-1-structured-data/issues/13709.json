On linux default tab behaviour is different and setting edit mode allows you to get a different one. \r\nTBH, it is so ingrained for every existing PowerShell user , and included in so many documents that changing it to someone else's preference has very little chance of happening.  I'd leave users to set their own preferences, most of us have our own customizations and I would impose mine on my user community. \r\n ",
