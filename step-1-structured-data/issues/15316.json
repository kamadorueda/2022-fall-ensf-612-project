      "body": "This is because the scheduled task module hasn\u2019t been marked as compatible with PSCore so it runs in an implicit remoting session. Any objects exchanged are serialised and thus the type information is mostly lost. You basically have a read only snapshot of those output objects as a PSObject.\r\n\r\nOn newer Windows builds the scheduled task module has been marked as compatible with PSCore and thus it is loaded directly in the session and no serialisation occurs. There\u2019s really not much you can do here as I doubt Microsoft will update the modules on older Windows versions for the sake of a product that didn\u2019t ship with that version.",
