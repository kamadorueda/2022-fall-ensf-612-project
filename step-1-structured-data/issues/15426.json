  "body": "Every time I open powershell I get this error:\r\n`Cannot load PSReadline module.  Console is running without PSReadline.\r\n`\r\nI added an alias to a profile.ps1 file in my user documents folder. (I have since removed it.) I think I started seeing the error after I opened powershell in VSCode the first time after adding the alias. (It asked a question about powershell when I opened it.) But now, all the powershell windows I open give this error. I have tried lots of policy execution changes and trying to install / remove PSReadline but nothing seems to work. I cannot get this error to leave me alone.\r\n```\r\n$PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

This is my first post here so it also serves as a little introduction. I am a c0d3r by heart, php dev since 20 years. I love scripting but i like many languages, scripts, markup, etc... Anyhow - i read about you all's problem. Just today i ran into the same issue after screwing around with powersHell, 4-6 modules paths, NcopyPaste {^_-}\r\n\r\nthan i got the error when i powershelled in... This is my solution, without touching gPolicy.\r\nin this case we temporary set the execPolicy for localMachine to remoteSigned,\r\nwe execute whatever, then we set the policy back to restricted. like so:\r\n\r\n 1 > log into an administrator prompt ( ctrl-shift LeftClick ) ; then\r\n 2 > log into the psPrompt - type: powershell  OR\r\n 2 > login to powershell as admin at step 1 and skip that.\r\n 3 > Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine\r\n x > Import-Module PSReadline\r\n x > Install-Module PSReadline\r\n 4 > Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope LocalMachine\r\n 5 > exit && shutdown /r /f /t 0\r\n\r\nthat was it for me. let me know if it worked for you too, or not.\r\n\r\n#!Cheers,\r\n~Joe.",
