  "body": "While a debugger is meant to allow you to modify variables, and otherwise debug and tinker with a program, the `$?` variable is a special case and its value should be preserved unless it is explicitly modified with an assignment command because PowerShell itself modifies that variable with any successful command that is invoked.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPush-Location -LiteralPath $env:USERPROFILE\r\n[Environment]::CurrentDirectory = $env:USERPROFILE\r\n${FileSystem::.\\test.ps1} = @'\r\nGet-Process -id 12345678\r\nif (-not $?) {\r\n    'The value of $? was preserved during debugging.'\r\n} else {\r\n    'The value of $? was changed to $true during debugging.'\r\n}\r\n'@\r\n$bp = Set-PSBreakPoint -Script .\\test.ps1 -Line 2\r\n& .\\test.ps1\r\nRemove-PSBreakpoint -Breakpoint $bp\r\nRemove-Item .\\test.ps1\r\nPop-Location\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point you will be in the debugger on the breakpoint. Invoke the following command:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$?\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll see that `$?` has a value of `$false`; however, since you invoked a command that was successful (i.e. that returned an exit code of 0), `$?` is now set to true. Invoke `c` to continue the script to allow it to run to completion.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe script outputs the following statement:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThe value of $? was preserved during debugging.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe script outputs the following statement:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThe value of $? was changed to $true during debugging.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
