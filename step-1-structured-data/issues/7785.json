If you look at the color properties:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177512/45563333-444ed180-b80a-11e8-9b8d-a91ad8c85a49.png)\r\n\r\nYou'll probably see that DarkGray (index 8) is set to the same value as Black (index 0).  Try lightening the index 8 color (DarkGray) to 169,169,169 (hex a9a9a9).  That's why you can't see parameters (and operators) because PSRL is configured by default to use index 8 (or `` \"`e[90m\"`` - bright foreground).\r\n\r\nYou could argue that PSRL shouldn't use `DarkGray` given the WSL default colors but that should be submitted to the PSRL repo - which I have already done.  You can pile on here - https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine/issues/744",
