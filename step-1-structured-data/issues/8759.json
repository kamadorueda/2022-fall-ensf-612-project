Open Terminal and `exec pwsh`, then execute the following command in PowerShell for macOS:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$x = Get-Content '~/Desktop/example.png'\r\n# Out-Host is written explicitly for expository purposes.\r\n# For an interactive session, '| Out-Host' is the default and can be omitted.\r\n$x | Out-Host\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAfter executing `$x | Out-Host`, you get a bunch of non-sense in the Terminal window, and **ready to type your next line of command**.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAfter executing `$x | Out-Host`, you get a bunch of non-sense in the Terminal window, and **get strange strings for the next line of command**.\r\n\r\nThe `example.png` itself demonstrates this behavior. N.B. don't look at the content written to the Terminal, as I cannot find a \"fixed point\" -- most picture that are complex enough will produce garbage strings on the input line.\r\n\r\nThe Terminal window should be immune to `Out-Host`. Windows `conhost` is immune to it.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.2\r\nOS                             Darwin 18.2.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.2.0: Th...\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",
