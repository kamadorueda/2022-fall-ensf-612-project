  "body": "Hey, I am from the Hyper-V team and we have some cmdlets that were working on for [Docker](https://github.com/Microsoft/Docker-PowerShell). All of the binaries are built using dotnet cli and are .NET Core compatible except for the PS Module classes because the only released reference to SMA are net46 and lower. I would like to try and port the cmdlets to run in PowerShell so we can give them a shot on Linux but need the set of binaries to be available to link in at build time for the PS module. Do you guys maintain a MyGet or VSO feed that I can pull the binaries from?\n\n@swernli FYI\n",
