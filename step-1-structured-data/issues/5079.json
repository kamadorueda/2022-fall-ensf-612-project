  "body": "That's a bit of a vague question, so let me be specific. I want to add the equivalent of this:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\nUpdate-TypeData -TypeName System.Managment.Automation.ErrorRecord -MemberName ErrorRecord -MemberType ScriptProperty -Value { $this }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo that you can *always* write: `$_.ErrorRecord` on _anything_ you can `catch` (and conversely: `$_.ErrorRecord.Exception`) ... because I find it confusing that sometimes I catch an Exception and sometimes an ErrorRecord.\r\n\r\nI know that the default types files were turned into C# code, but where is it?\r\n\r\nP.S. I'd love to also add `.Exception` to all exceptions, but since ETS doesn't apply to derived types the way extension methods do, I think that's probably not worth it. Which reminds me ... PowerShell *really* needs support for .Net extension methods.",
