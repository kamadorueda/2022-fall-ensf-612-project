  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nJust like this works:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# OK, accepts an *array* of strings to cast.\r\n[int[]] ('1', '2').GetType.FullName\r\n```\r\n\r\nso should this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# !! BROKEN - *array* of hashtables isn't meaningfully supported - and is a virtual no-op.\r\n[pscustomobject[]] (@{ prop = 1 }, @{ prop = 2 })\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, the behavior of an _array_ cast should be analogous to a scalar one, as it _mostly_ already is.\r\n\r\nIn the case of `[pscustomobject[]]`, however, the cast is virtually ignored (in reality, the input array is uselessly wrapped in a largely invisible `[psobject]` instance, as explained in #13836):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# !! BROKEN - no conversion takes place.\r\nPS> [pscustomobject[]] (@{ prop = 1 }, @{ prop = 2 }) | % { $_.GetType().FullName }\r\nSystem.Collections.Hashtable\r\nSystem.Collections.Hashtable\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nInstead, the hashtables should individually be converted to `[pscustomobject]`s and a strongly typed `[pscustomobject[]]` array should be constructed from them.\r\n\r\n",
