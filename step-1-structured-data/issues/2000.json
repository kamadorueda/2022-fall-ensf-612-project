  "body": "Inspired by PR #1901, I suggest Microsoft create a new version of strict mode for better writing style. In this new version, suppress **all** aliases by default. (People really should not use aliases in scripts/modules!) Enforcing good command invoking style makes backward compatibility easier both for Microsoft and script writer.\n\nExample:\n\n``` PowerShell\nSet-StrictMode -Version 123; # 123 is an imaginary version number.\niwr -Uri example.com; # This line fails since aliases are suppressed here.\nSet-Alias iwr Invoke-WebRequest;\niwr -Uri example.com; # This line succeeds since `iwr` is set explicitly in the scope.\n```\n\nIf suppressing all aliases is not approachable, it at least should suppress all aliases that are identical to utilities that is popular in Linux/Unix.\n\nAnd Microsoft should leave Linux/Unix aliases available to scripts that are not setting this version of strict mode and running on Windows PowerShell. Removing those aliases from Windows PowerShell interactive sessions is good. That'll be acceptable for compatibility and better consistency with PowerShell on other systems.\n",

      "body": "Unfortunately, I don't have a ton of historical context on `Set-StrictMode` like @BrucePay or @LeeHolmes, but I get the sense it's more about syntactical language purity than best pratices. \n\nFor that reason, I'd actually lean more towards this being implemented via [Script Analyzer](https://github.com/powershell/psscriptanalyzer), our static analysis tool. We already have an `AvoidAlias` rule over there, though it was aggressively derided for being too noisy on people who didn't feel like aliases in scripts were a problem. Given everything with #1901, maybe it's time to bump it up to an `Error` level severity and tell the pro-alias folks to override `AvoidAlias` in their PSSA settings files. \n",

      "body": "I think turning off aliases needs to be tiered a bit rather than a simple on/off. Not all aliases are equally bad. I see the same discussion in PSScriptAnalyzer because its too noisy for core scenarios.\r\n\r\nAliases like `iwr`, `curl`, `gci`, `ls`, and `cat` are bad for two reasons:\r\n1. Too Short and hard to read\r\n2. Aliases to existing executables like curl, ls, and cat\r\n\r\nThe most useful aliases are: `Select`, `Where`, `Group`, `Sort`, `%`.\r\n\r\nI found when doing a lot with the pipeline, the % alias (ForEach-Object) is invaluable to actually making it readable because you can very quickly finding yourself with lots of nested foreach loops. Cutting that down to just % substantially simplifies the code. I know some people stay away from pipelines but I see % as important as | itself and once you get used to it, reads faster than foreach itself or ForEach-Object.\r\n\r\nSo at a minimum I think we should keep all of the Aliases for -Object since they are core fundamentals of PowerShell and reduce noise a lot. They are likely to be the most used aliases. The full list is below:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS C:\\> Get-Alias | Where ReferencedCommand -Like \"*-Object\" | Select DisplayName\r\n\r\nDisplayName              \r\n-----------              \r\n% -> ForEach-Object      \r\n? -> Where-Object        \r\ncompare -> Compare-Object\r\ndiff -> Compare-Object   \r\nforeach -> ForEach-Object\r\ngroup -> Group-Object    \r\nmeasure -> Measure-Object\r\nselect -> Select-Object  \r\nsort -> Sort-Object      \r\ntee -> Tee-Object        \r\nwhere -> Where-Object    \r\n```\r\n",
