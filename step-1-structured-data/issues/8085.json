  "body": "With a Here-String, one must align the content and the close to the left without whitespace for it to work properly. It would be great if the close didn't require no indentation (but could be required to be on its own line, minus the whitespace). Then, however far it is indented, remove that leading whitespace from the content.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the dashes would be whitespace:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nFunction Name {\r\n  Param()\r\n  $Message = @\"\r\n  String value\r\n  Other value\r\n    More indentation\r\n  \"@\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if the value of $Message would be:\r\n```none\r\nString value\r\nOther value\r\n  More indentation\r\n```",
