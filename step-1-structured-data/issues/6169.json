  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nFollowing updates with this PR:\r\n1) build.psm1 was recently changed to use 'Save-Module' in Restore-PSPester #6112 . This broke Docker package validation tests. This PR fixes this by pre-creating target directory for Pester module.\r\n2) adding default values for dockerfile arguments. This helps with occasional need of manual building of dockerfiles by making command line shorter.\r\n3) making location of PS Git repo a parameter; this implicitly includes support for PATs.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nNote: Please mark anything not applicable to this PR `NA`.\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [ ] Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [NA] User facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- [X] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [NA] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n    - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n",
