  "body": "Per #1085, there was confusing over keybindings on Linux / OS X. Since we use PSReadLine, it is up to the user to choose a preferred editing mode, and PSReadLine reasonably defaulted to Windows. However, this leads to a subpar experience on non-Windows platforms, where almost everything respects Emacs keybindings (especially shells).\n\nThis fixes PSReadLine so that the key bindings are set based on the default edit mode, and sets the default edit mode to Emacs when `LINUX` is defined. Pester tests are included.\n\nI do, however, have an open question for @lzybkr about the need to `_chordDispatchTable.Clear()` when changing key bindings. Each of `SetDefaultWindowsBindings()`, `SetDefaultEmacsBindings()` and `SetDefaultVimBindings()` bind `_chordDispatchTable` to a new dictionary, thus overwriting it. Is it actually necessary then  to clear the previous value? \n",
