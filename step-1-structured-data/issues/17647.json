  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nThe show window/ogv option is great, but it is a little hard on the eyes. This is especially true using PowerShell 7+ console, or the Windows Terminal with a dark color scheme. \r\n\r\nIt would be great for the same granularity of the console to extend to the show window UI (I would love to know the object name for this element, I can not seem to fine any official name for this). However, I would be happy with a simple light mode/dark mode option. \r\n\r\nSince I do not know the UI element name, I can not offer any technical suggestions. \n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
