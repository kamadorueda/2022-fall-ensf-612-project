Are there C# statements that continue to the next statement if there is no surrounding `try{}` block but jump to `catch{}` otherwise?  That's what `$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminating()` seems to do.  I would consider PowerShell `throw`'s behavior consistent with usual try/catch semantics, but not `$PSCmdlet.ThrowTerminating()`.\r\n\r\n>If a terminating error occurs - whether script- or statement-terminating - the entire try block is exited at the point the error occurs and execution resumes in the catch block.\r\n\r\nThis much is evident from the repro in my OP.
