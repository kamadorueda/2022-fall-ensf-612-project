  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up to reverted PR #8346. I removed a workaround that was used to avoid [a Newtonsoft.Json bug](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/issues/1321) that caused some incomplete json array input to successfully be deserialized.\r\n\r\nThis bug being fixed, I thought the workaround was unnecessary, but after the merge some feature tests started to fail (which I did not run prior to merging).\r\n\r\nIt was discovered that the workaround is still needed because while the first Newtonsoft.Json bug was fixed, some cases of incomplete json array input still behave unexpectedly, namely json input `[`. \r\n\r\nThis PR is just to update the comment explaining the workaround so it links to the newly created issue [here](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/issues/1930).\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n",
