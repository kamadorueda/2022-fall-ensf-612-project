      "body": "\r\n`Write-Output` (unlike `Write-Host`) is not concerned with output formatting / presentation, so adding `-NoNewLine` isn't appropriate.\r\n\r\n`Write-Output` writes objects to the success output stream.\r\n\r\nIf such an object is a (multi-line) string that should have no trailing newline, use a string operation to trim that newline; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create a file with a trailing newline.\r\n@'\r\na\r\nb\r\n'@ > t.txt\r\n\r\n# Read the file in full, as-is.\r\n$content = [io.file]::ReadAllText(\"$pwd/t.txt\")\r\n\r\n# Strip the trailing newline, if any.\r\n$content -replace '\\r?\\n\\z'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf, by contrast, you want to create output _for display_ and output a string in a manner that makes _subsequent console output_ start immediately after rather than on a new line, use `Write-Host -NoNewline`.\r\n",
