Perhaps there is a way that we can host our own web service on an Azure VM.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
