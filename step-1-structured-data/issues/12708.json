  "body": "# Add support for ArgumentCompletionAttributes with parameters \r\n\r\nArgumentCompleters are in the current implementation created by type, using a default constructor.\r\n\r\nThis makes it very hard to provide parameters to the completed, limiting their usefulness.\r\n\r\nI propose that we add \"Factory\" support to the completion system, so that an attribute derived from `ArgumentCompleterFactoryAttribute` gets called on a method with a signature like\r\n```csharp\r\nIArgumentCompleter Create();\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would allow the derived attribute to use attribute parameters to create the actual argument completer.\r\n\r\nDeriving from ArgumentCompleterFactoryAttribute makes it possible to create generic completers, like\r\n```csharp\r\n[DirectoryCompleter(ContainingFile=\"pswh.exe\", Depth=2)]\r\n\r\n[DateCompleter(WeekDay='Monday', From=\"LastYear\")]\r\n\r\n[GitCommits(Branch='release')]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn sample usage could look like this:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n   /// <summary>\r\n    /// Creates new number completions\r\n    /// </summary>\r\n    public class NumberCompletionsAttribute : ArgumentCompleterFactoryAttribute\r\n    {\r\n        private readonly int _from;\r\n        private readonly int _to;\r\n        private readonly int _step;\r\n\r\n        public NumberCompletionsAttribute(int from, int to, int step = 1) \r\n        {\r\n            _from = @from;\r\n            _to = to;\r\n            _step = step;\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        public IArgumentCompleter Create() => new NumberCompleter(_from, _to, _step);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n public class NumberCompleter : IArgumentCompleter\r\n    private readonly int _from;\r\n    private readonly int _to;\r\n    private readonly int _step;\r\n\r\n    public NumberCompleter(int from, int to, int step)\r\n    {\r\n        _from = @from;\r\n        _to = to;\r\n        _step = step;\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    public IEnumerable<CompletionResult> CompleteArgument(string commandName, string parameterName, string wordToComplete, CommandAst commandAst, IDictionary fakeBoundParameters)\r\n        {\r\n/// complete using the passed parameters\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThere are a couble of ways to go about this:\r\n\r\n1. New abstract class `ArgumentCompleterFactoryAttribute` with an abstract `Create` method.\r\n2. New interface `IArgumentCompleterFactory` That the attributes implement if they want the factory support.\r\n3. Combine the above: Have `ArgumentCompleterFactoryAttribute` implement `IArgumentCompleterFactory`\r\n\r\n\r\nPull request for implementation can be found here: #12605",

About the implementation, why not have an abstract attribute class that defines an abstract method which returns an `IArgumentCompleter` instance?
