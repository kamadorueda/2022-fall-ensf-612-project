  "body": "ApartmentState STA/MTA is only used to interop with COM and not supported on non-Windows.  It also seems that dotnet can [marshal between STA and MTA](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/interop/interop-marshaling#marshaling_and_com_apartments) just fine so allowing the user to set it is just a perf optimization.\r\n\r\nI propose we simplify our code by removing support.  The code base today already has ApartmentState commented out as we run MTA by default (as that is default for dotnet) so this is simply removing the `#if !CORECLR` conditional code.",

      "body": "@stevel-msft I want to add that removing support for appartmentstate would not have be good. I have seen cases where certain COM APIs can cause threading issues and lead to very bad performance, therefore the ability to optionally execute as STA is critical.\r\nTherefore it is good that it was decided to not remove support for it. I just wanted to bring this up in case this issue gets re-considered.",
