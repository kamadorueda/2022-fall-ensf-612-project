      "body": "Right, but does it work in 5.1 still after the upgrade (enabling TLS 1.2 before trying)? Since you can run 5.1 and 6.1.0 side-by-die, I'm trying to establish where the fault is. So I'm asking you to test it in 5.1 on the same machine where it is failing with 6.1.0. Can you confirm, please?\r\n\r\nI ask because I am unable to reproduce this anywhere. Since the underlying .NET Calls also fail, I suspect this is a system/environment issue. This kind of error can occur if you have networking tools between the client (CoreFX) and the server. These could be anything from firewalls, monitoring software, silent proxies, proxies, intrusion detection, antivirus, etc. ",
