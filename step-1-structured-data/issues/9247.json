  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nAccording to [this comment by daxian-dbw](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/9091#issuecomment-473704625), `\"abc\"\"def\"`should be parsed to `abc\"def`. This was not covered in the old test cases, but should be now with this PR.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tests for the `import-alias` by file, in a seperate PR as discussed in #9091. After this gets accepted, it should be possible to start refactoring `import-alias`. Details about this refactorization can be found in #9091 .\r\n\r\nThis pr adds the following test cases for import alias by file:\r\n\r\n* `\"abc\"\"def\"` should parse to `abc\"def`\r\n* `\"aaa\"` should parse to `aaa`\r\n* `\"a,b\"` should parse to `a,b`\r\n* If an alias file is read with a line containing more than four values, throw an error\r\n* If an alias file is read with a line containing less than four values, throw an error\r\n\r\nIf more exhaustive testing is required, please let me know.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",
