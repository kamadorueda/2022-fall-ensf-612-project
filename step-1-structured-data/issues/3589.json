  "body": "Fix #3587\r\n\r\nWhen not specifying -publish with Start-PSBuild (using 'dotnet build'), the TPA list used by the host powershell.exe (dotnet.exe actually) contains a path to the incorrect Microsoft.CSharp.dll, which is of version 4.0.2.0. The tracking issue in dotnet/cli is https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/6352\r\n\r\nNote that the `-Publish` parameter is kept in `Start-PSBuild` to avoid breaking workflows for people who are used to run `Start-PSBuild -Publish`, but the usage of `-Publish` has been removed in all powershell build scripts.\r\n",
