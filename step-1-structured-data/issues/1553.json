Remove existing PowerShell/PowerShell project\n2. Check that appveypor webhook is removed from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/settings/hooks\n3. Create a AppVeyor new from powershell github repo\n4. Go to https://ci.appveyor.com/project/PowerShell/powershell/settings/badges and copy new badges urls, change them in our top-level README.md\n5. Make sure that new web-hook was created to trigger builds.\n",
