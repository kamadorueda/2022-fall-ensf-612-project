  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nHey, I wasn't sure where to report this, I tried StackOverflow and Technet too but didn't get any response, wanted to know why is [CimCmdlets] module is not supported on platforms other than Windows? I've got a script that I need to run on both Linux and windows but couldn't do that because this module is missing. Also, the Get-WmiObject commandlet doesn't seem to be working on Linux.\r\nFYI- The script I'm running is basically using -computerName flag and the device mentioned for this tag is a windows machine only. with the script, we are trying to fetch the windows device information on the Linux machines.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "Get-WmiObject is not in PowerShell 6 or 7.  It is only in Windows PowerShell 5. There's been a push to get people to use the \"CIM\" named commands instead of \"WMI\" named ones. ( Cim and WMI are the same thing, but the older commands do remoting over DCOM and the new ones do remoting over WSMAN.)\r\n  \r\nGenerally where something has a -ComputerName parameter it is using Windows-centric networking. If it has a -Hostname parameter that is for SSH.  AFAIK PowerShell's route into and out of Linux is SSH only, (no WSMAN) so you need to configure PowerShell access over ssh on Windows and then run the command you need in a remote session.  \r\n",
