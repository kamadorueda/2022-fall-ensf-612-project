      "body": "@jpsnover current workaround is to rename your script to have the .ps1 extension.  the problem seems to be that the OS calls `powershell hello`.  PowerShell doesn't know that `hello` is a script, so it executes `hello` which then spawns another `powershell hello` recursively thus the \"hang\".  We probably need to peek into the command given to us to see if it's a shebang and if it's calling powershell, we just treat it like a script file rather than executing it natively.",
