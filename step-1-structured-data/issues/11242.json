  "body": "@jszabo98 discovered the `Start-ThreadJob` problem in #11092; it affects `ForEach-Object -Parallel` as well\r\n\r\nUnlike #11092, it doesn't seem to be related to output formatting data per se, but to the VT escape sequences created to highlight the matching part of a line, given that the problem goes away when you add `-NoEmphasis` - even though the tests use `-Raw` for direct `[string]` output, in which case `-NoEmphasis` should have no effect, given that `-Raw` doesn't perform highlighting.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Adding -NoEmphasis to Select-String makes the problem go away.\r\nStart-ThreadJob { 'hi' | Select-String hi -Raw } | Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob | Should -be hi\r\n'hi' | ForEach-Object -parallel { $_ | Select-String hi -Raw } | Should -Be hi\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests emit an error message and fail:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nSelect-String: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n...\r\n ^ Expected 'hi', but got $null.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.6\r\n```\r\n",
