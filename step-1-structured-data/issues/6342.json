  "body": "When decorating a function with `[CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess=$true)]`, calling that function with `-WhatIf` will pass on the `-WhatIf` parameter to functions called within that also supports this. In the example below one can see this working for `Move-Item`, but not for `Expand-Archive`.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Demonstrate-Bug {\r\n    [CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess=$true)]\r\n    param ()\r\n\r\n    # Does not rename file, but instead outputs the following:\r\n    # What if: Performing the operation \"Move File\" on target \"Item: C:\\Temp\\Foo.zip Destination: C:\\Temp\\Bar.zip\".\r\n    Move-Item -Path .\\Foo.zip -Destination Bar.zip\r\n\r\n    # Would expect the following to not expand the archive, but instead only print a \"What if\" message similar to above.\r\n    Expand-Archive -Path .\\Foo.zip\r\n\r\n    # If Expand-Arvhice is called explicitely with -WhatIf, I get the following output:\r\n    # What if: Performing the operation \"Expand-Archive\" on target \"C:\\Temp\\Foo.zip\".\r\n}\r\n\r\nDemonstrate-Bug -WhatIf\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n`Expand-Archive` isn't actually called, but instead a message explaining what would happen without `-WhatIf` is outputted.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe `Foo.zip` archive gets expanded, even though `Demonstrate-Bug` is called with the `-WhatIf` parameter.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.16299.248\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.16299.248\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```\r\n",
