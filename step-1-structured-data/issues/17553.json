But not all URIs work like that. One photo site I'm on has URLs in the form\r\n\"https://site.com/userFolder/PictureID/photographer\"\r\nThe extension isn't in the URL at all and the distinctive part is not the final one.  The first is solvable by looking at the mime type but there are always going to be cases where the naming scheme defeats any attempt get a sensible output name.  Its one for discussion - perhaps what you suggest suits a big majority and for the other cases people need to code something which isn't quite so tidy \r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote></blockquote>",

Since this is not a file download program (like wget or aria2), there is no common solution.\r\n\r\nSome people will want to use it as a download program. \r\n\r\nIf there is a solution which works most of the time it's a \"Post a script to the gallery\" answer. If there is a solution which works nearly 100% of the time it's an \"include it in PowerShell\" answer. So I'm trying to understand what the percentage is likely to be -  I make a lot of calls to things where the file name isn't easy to select, but I don't think I'm typical. \r\n",

Usually it's not even a script, but a script block for a specific task right in the console.\r\nNevertheless, it would be possible to make the `-OutFile` parameter without necessarily specifying the saved file. If the file is not specified then the file name is taken from the last segment of the url and the file is saved in the current directory. I think it would be convenient (especially when the name is long and difficult to remember, and copying it is an additional action)",
