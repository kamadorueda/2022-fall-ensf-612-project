I'm stuck at this step (of course with the correct PowerShell path):\r\n\r\n```Subsystem    powershell c:/program files/powershell/VERSION/powershell.exe -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile```\r\n\r\nIf I run this command on the Windows 2012 R2 server, it says:\r\n\r\n```Subsystem : The term 'Subsystem' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.```\r\n\r\nAm I missing something? Is this a PATH issue?",
