But after I look the binding code I think the code is too sensitive (we can break something) and the simple fix is more reliable.\r\n\r\nThe code is in ReflectionParameterBinder() https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/e9152a59a56a4203f756d03fbe719600d25f5c78/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/ReflectionParameterBinder.cs#L192\r\n\r\nCan we safely replace `(ActionPreference)v` with `v as ActionPreference`?",
