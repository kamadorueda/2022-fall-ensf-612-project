Seems like PowerShell should treat modules as case-insensitive.  I don't see any value in allowing posh-git, Posh-Git and Posh-GIT to be different modules.  I think that would just lead to confusion.  IMO all of the module-related commands should be case-insensitive.  And if on Linux someone has both mymodule and MyModule dirs. and is trying to import Mymodule, PowerShell should warn the user about the conflict.",

That said, the PowerShell Gallery should consider warning (or rejecting) when publishing scripts that would stomp a different script with the same name on a case-insensitive file system.  Either that or use some other means of disambiguation (author name, pub-date, version, etc).\r\n",
