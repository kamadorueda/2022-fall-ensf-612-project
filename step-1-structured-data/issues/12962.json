Where as for PowerShell they don't.\r\n\r\nBy not supporting this in some way, it means that alias's to native executables are better in bash because the experience is more fluid.\r\n\r\nAlso, the function approach that we have means we lose out on the work @rjmholt did in UnixCompleters.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nPerhaps a new kind of alias that will funnel tab completion all the way down to the alias'd command string?\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\nSet-Alias gb 'git branch' -AliasType CommandString # vs ... CommandLiteral or something... naming is hard but you get the idea\r\n```",

So the primary use case indeed is for stacking up some commonly used arguments.\r\n\r\nThis one might as well be my [favorite one](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/e32d4b1e195f4c7777844beea97af42bd93434eb/plugins/git/git.plugin.zsh#L204):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nalias glola=\"git log --graph --pretty='%Cred%h%Creset -%C(auto)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --all\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n@doctordns",
