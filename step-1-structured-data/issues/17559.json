  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Obtain a code signing cert and assign it to $Certificate\r\n2. Sign a file using that certificate `Get-ChildItem dbatools.dll -Recurse | Set-AuthenticodeSignature -Certificate $certificate`\r\n\r\nThat file is signed as SHA1\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8278033/175015543-2e54c67c-b27f-49c9-9f8b-c2bf17a5b71f.png)\r\n\r\nThe docs say:\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-authenticodesignature?view=powershell-7.2\r\n\r\n```\r\n-HashAlgorithm\r\nSpecifies the hashing algorithm that Windows uses to compute the digital signature for the file.\r\n\r\nFor PowerShell 3.0, the default is SHA256, which is the Windows default hashing algorithm. For PowerShell 2.0, the default is SHA1. Files that are signed with a different hashing algorithm might not be recognized on other systems. Which algorithms are supported depends on the version of the operating system.\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease please please also update the `Microsoft.PowerShell.Security` module that 5.1 uses, too. The world would appreciate this more secure default.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nConsidering SHA1 is deprecated, insecure and not the expected algorithm per the docs, the `HashAlgorithm` should default to SHA256 instead of SHA1\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe default is SHA1\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
