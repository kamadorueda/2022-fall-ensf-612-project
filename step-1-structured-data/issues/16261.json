  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nExtracting [Windows build ZIP](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v7.1.5/PowerShell-7.1.5-win-x64.zip) produces files names with backslashes on MacOS. This occurs with the built in Archive Utility.app as well as msbuild [Unzip](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/unzip-task?view=vs-2019) task. This does not occur with the the command line utility unzip.\r\n\r\nA little research points to the ZIP file not being [backwards compatible](https://superuser.com/questions/1382839/zip-files-expand-with-backslashes-on-linux-no-subdirectories).\r\n\r\nI understand handling of the backslash character should be handled in the archive utility. However given the of how this affects the MacOS built in utility and how pervasive it is perhaps it can be looked at in the spirit of being a good citizen of the ZIP standard.\r\n\r\nI understand if this may be an issue with the underlying compression utility/framework. I was unable to follow the build process used to create the ZIP. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nExtracting Windows build ZIP file created proper folder structure.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nExtraction creates file names with backslashes instead for sub folders.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nNo error occurs.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nNot applicable.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
