Users are not always looking for an answer and are instead making a module suggestion.\r\n\r\nAdditional time period is needed to allow users to communicate their intentions more clearly and resolve misunderstandings. So either the bot needs to be adjusted or maintainers / PS team need to be much more hesitant to mark issues as resolved or answered without first confirming with the user who opened the issue.\r\n\r\nIf we do not, people will be deterred from reporting issues. The perception currently is frequently that their requests are not being heard out completely, and being dismissed at the earliest opportunity.",

At the end of the day, PowerShell 7 (at least P.3) can not support several modules (Best Practices, WSUS amongst them plus you can not install docker/WIn Containers). The goal of replacing WIndows PowerShell 5.x with PowerShell 7 is a worthy one and one I support - but these are two modules we need at least a workaround for. \r\n\r\nAnd immediately closing an issue, eg #10540 without ensuring the issue is actually resolved (or resolvable), seems premature.\r\n\r\nFinally, shouldn't it be for the OP to agree with closing an issue?",
