  "body": "The current pswin job is super tightly coupled and side effect dependent on several scripts. It's also super slow. I intend to refactor it into 'razzlespy' and 'makegen' jobs. The razzlespy job has one big issue  it must be run from its folder, and will output to there as well. The makegen job needs to be refactored. The current way it takes the list of DLLs we use violates DRY badly. Once this is fixed, it just needs to be setup as a downstream job and should work pretty well.
