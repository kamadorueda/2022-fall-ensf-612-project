  "body": "Separate fixes for the header and the data rows.  If it's the last column, don't add trailing padding.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed some Format-Table tests that were `Pending` but the issue was closed.\r\n\r\nOne side-effect is that using `out-file -width` you don't get the padding on the right most column which seems fine as the parameter is for limiting the width rather than ensuring the width.  But it is a breaking change.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5532\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.

This is consistently with behavior today such as:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\"hello\" | out-file -width 100 -path .\\hello.txt\r\n```\r\nAlso, formatting has not been guaranteed to be a specific format, so this is not a breaking change.",
