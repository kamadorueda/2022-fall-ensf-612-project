  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nRelated #6874. The PR is coming from a code review to cleanup psl. Here we clean up the side branch of the code that will allow later to clean up a branch which uses psl.\r\n\r\n- IO.FileInfo does not make system calls in constructor.  So we can create the object and then use the required attributes without direct call IO.FileInfo.GetAttributes() ( SafeGetFileAttributes() ). This allow us to exclude some p/invoke calls in our code in later cleanups. Also we get unified code for both Windows and Unix.\r\n- Remove SafeGetFileAttributes() and WinSafeGetFileAttributes(). Currently .Net Core support file attributes on all platforms in fastest way and we can remove our workaround. We get a regression in rare case (for files like pagefile.sys). Fix is ready in [CoreFX](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/29782), we get it in 2.1.1. I suggest ignore the regression because this is a very-very rare situation (Get-ChildItem c:\\pagefile.sys -Hidden). The .Net Core team was not even able to create an artificial test for such files and uses a real pagefile.sys file for the test. Also the enumeration is still working (dir c:\\ -hidden).\r\n- Re-add test which we lost in #4050. The test is pending because of the regression.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
