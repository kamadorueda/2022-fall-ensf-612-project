  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen `Get-Error` was implemented, there was a deliberate decision to introduce a new `FormatAccent` color to help differentiate the metadata from the data visually.  We can use this same color to separate table headers and list metadata.  This PR implements this https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14406\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11859881/102249659-718dfc80-3eb7-11eb-972e-e12176c77db0.png)\r\n\r\n@powercode asked a good question whether we want separate user configurations for tables vs lists.  My preference is to keep it simple and just have one setting.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is that if ANSI is available, the table header can be rendered with an underline instead of using up a row of dashes.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Using the accentColor for labels works as well or as badly as the choice of different accents - the change to a green font is fine, everything _flows_ , the change to background means that blue block for the table header makes it too separate. This is a lot less controversial than some of the others, if one dislikes it, change the accent colour, if one wants to go mad with it, change the accent colour :-)  \r\n \r\nUnderline for headers is worth considering (but green does it quite nicely. )   I'd also suggest looking at whether ----- should be as wide as the label, or run the full width of the column. Underline probably only goes as far as the text.. \r\n",

We can see how it is changed in your video so it's reasonably clear that the white on blue was a user choice - and users can pick what works for them (even if others hate it). Personally I'd have bold labels and one colour.  Provided it redirects without escape codes of course :-) ",

Since this is now under `$PSStyle.Formatting`, I think just calling it `TableHeader` would be concise and don't need the word `Format` in it at all.",
