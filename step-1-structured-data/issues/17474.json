  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nIn windows , Resource Monitor --> Network --> Listening Ports, it lists image(process), PID, address , port, protocol, firewall status. it's quite useful for user who use UI , but for user who use powershell to manage windows , the corresponding CMDLET is Get-NetTCPConnection ,  this doesn't display the image(process) name and firewall status , which is not so convenient \uff0csomeone may say the image name can be obtained via querying the displayed PID, but how about the firewall status ?\r\n\r\n In Linux , the similar command is ss -lnp.\r\n\r\nCould someone do a native cmdlet for --\"Resource Monitor -- Network -- Listening Ports\" rather than require user to write his own powershell function to get the same info.\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nattach a screenshot which is took from the resource monitor UI .\r\n![ss-ln-via-powershell](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36788337/171804160-0c9808d0-1c27-4208-9392-c3ca16ed65f7.PNG)\r\n",
