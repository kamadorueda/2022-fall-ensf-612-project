  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a Linux (Ubuntu mainly) user I want to be able to read/write to BitLocker encrypted drives so that I can interact with my BitLocker encrypted drives while running from Linux.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nRight now, Ubuntu (and few other linux distributions) have a program in the normal repositories that allows for finding BitLocker encrypted drives (gives the location to the volume, such that it may look like /dev/sda3 ), and allows mounting those drives as either read-only or read and write.\r\n\r\nThe program I speak of is named [Dislocker](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker), which uses a [GNU GPL v2 license](https://github.com/Aorimn/dislocker/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) (links lead to github pages). \r\n\r\nDislocker may be useful in figuring out how to get started on implementing bde drive mounts for Linux.",
