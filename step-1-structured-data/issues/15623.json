If you supply a scriptblock as you did in the OP, the literal string value of the scriptblock will be used -- it's roughly the same thing as if you'd put the whole argument within single quotes. As a result the $a variable wouldn't have been expanded, so the file wouldn't be found in that instance. \ud83d\ude42 ",
