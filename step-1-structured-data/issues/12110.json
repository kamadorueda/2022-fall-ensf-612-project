The API does not support a progress.

I believe it is more right way.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/9141961?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/runtime\">dotnet/runtime</a></strong></div><div>.NET is a cross-platform runtime for cloud, IoT, and desktop apps. - dotnet/runtime</div></blockquote>",
