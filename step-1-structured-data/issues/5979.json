The MSI installer should have two checkboxes: register eventing manifest (checked by default), register powershell remoting (unchecked by default) along with appropriate MSI options for quiet installs.",

I already have a dummy prototype working that executes a psscript as an admin but I will be busier for the rest of this week, so I guess you can expect a PR in February if that's OK?\r\nHave a think about the UI aspect please in the meantime (I think we need more details in parenthesis to briefly explain what the options mean) and the preferred name for the MSI properties. I suggest putting it together with the existing custom dialog:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9250262/35248128-dff40bc2-ffc4-11e7-904f-c6774486a195.png)\r\n",

If it doesn't make Preview1, no problem!\r\n\r\nI think putting it in the `Optional Features` in your mockup seems fine.  Suggest some wording changes:\r\n\r\n- Register Windows Event Logging Manifest\r\n- Enable PowerShell Core remoting\r\n\r\ncc @joeyaiello for wording suggestions\r\n",
