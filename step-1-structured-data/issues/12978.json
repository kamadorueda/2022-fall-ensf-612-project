  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a PowerShell CmdLet developer, I would like to be able to use the Verb `Undeploy` for my Cmdlets, so i can write Cmdlets that undo a `Deploy` action (and are using a valid Verb to pass quality standards).\r\n\r\nThe verb `Deploy` was added in PowerShell 6, but strangely the verb `Undeploy` was not added at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn many operations the verb `Undeploy` is relevant, meaning to revert or undo a Deployment action. For example, removing software from a device that was added using a `Deploy` command.\r\n\r\nOther Verbs that are paired with a 'Un' version:\r\n- `Block` <==> `Unblock`\r\n- `Install` <==> `Uninstall`\r\n- `Lock` <==> `Unlock`\r\n- `Protect` <==> `Unprotect`\r\n- `Publish` <==> `Unpublish`\r\n- `Register` <==> `Unregister`\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n- Add the Verb `Undeploy` to the list of approved Verbs (as returned by `Get-Verb`).\r\n- Allow Code Analysis (`PsScriptAnalyzer`) to recognize and validate `Undeploy` as a valid Verb.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the correct place to submit this issue is, see also : [my uservoice entry](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell/suggestions/40686598-make-the-verb-deploy-symmetrical-by-adding-a-new)",
