  "body": "For better security and privacy, I think it is better to use HTTPS links wherever possible. So I replace all occurrences of `http://go.microsoft.com` with `https://go.microsoft.com` in all non-binary files in this repository. Note that some go.microsoft.com links redirect to http and then to https, such as https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135255. They should redirect to https directly. Could you fix them on the server side?\n",
