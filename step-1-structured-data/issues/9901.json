  "body": "<!-- Anything that looks like this is a comment and can't be seen after the Pull Request is created. -->\r\n\r\n# PR Summary\r\n\r\nResolves #7713 \r\nThis adds a `-Raw` switch parameter to Select-String, for convenience. \r\n\r\n<!-- Summarize your PR between here and the checklist. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\nThis is my first PR to the PowerShell repo, so I picked this tiny issue. As to why this switch is desirable has already been discussed thoroughly in the issue. \r\n\r\n~~The approach I've taken does not introduce new parameter sets, even though -Raw is not compatible with -Quiet and -Context.~~ In the case -Raw is used together with -Context, the latter is ignored. To me, it would not make sense to have context lines when all we want is matched lines. ~~In the case -Raw is used together with -Quiet, Quiet takes precedence, because the choice for precedence seemed somewhat arbitrary and it was easier to implement this way. One might argue that respecting a users whish for -Quiet behaviour is more important than returning strings in that case.~~\r\n_Edit: after discussion, -Raw and -Quiet were put in separate parametersets._\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n\r\nI'm unsure about this part below \u2b07\ufe0f . I think you could say this is a backwards compatible breaking change. It introduces a new feature, but does not break existing functionality.
