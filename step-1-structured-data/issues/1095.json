  "body": "There are few people, who are working simultaneously on adding new dlls to the build.\n\nCurrent [mapping](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/workflow/mapping.md) process is not suitable for that case: it uses single `mappings.json` file which makes it hard to isolate porting new assemlbies.\n### Proposed changes\n- Split `mappings.json` into `mappings.json` for every project (folder under `src`)\n- Throw away `src\\monad` prefix, now it's not relevant\n- Make `Copy-SubmoduleFiles` flexible about set of `mappings.json` that it uses\n- Add checks to `Copy-SubmoduleFiles` to avoid copying wrong versions of files.\n",
