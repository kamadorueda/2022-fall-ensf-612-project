  "body": "<!--\n\nIf it is a bug report:\n- make sure you are able to repro it on the latest released version. \nYou can install the latest version from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases\n- Search the existing issues.\n- Refer to the [FAQ](../docs/FAQ.md).\n- Refer to the [known issues](../docs/KNOWNISSUES.md).\n- Fill out the following repro template\n\nIf it's not a bug, please remove the template and elaborate the issue in your own words.\n-->\n## Context\n\nOn Linux, it's common to use error stream (2) as an information stream.\nThere is no errors in this case, it's just a way to report info.\nWhen PowerShell redirects error stream, it wraps all output from stream 2 in **NativeCommandError** ErrorRecord.\n\nThat doesn't happen for interactive experience (when there is no redirection), but it shows up in logs, scripting and non-console powershell hosts (i.e. PowerShell ISE).\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n``` powershell\ngrep 2>txt\ncat txt\n```\n\nOn windows, you can use grep that comes with git to do the same.\n## Expected behavior\n\n```\nUsage: /usr/bin/grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...\nTry '/usr/bin/grep --help' for more information.\n```\n## Actual behavior\n\n```\ngrep : Usage: /usr/bin/grep [OPTION]... PATTERN [FILE]...\nAt line:1 char:1\n+ grep 2>txt\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (Usage: /usr/bin...TTERN [FILE]...:String) [], RemoteException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError\n\nTry '/usr/bin/grep --help' for more information.\n```\n## Environment data\n\nAny version of powershell\n",
