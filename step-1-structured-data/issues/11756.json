      "body": "This would be breaking change, from what I can tell, because `$ShellID` is used to derive configuration paths / settings from, notably the (current-host) `$PROFILE` path(s). (The distinction between the editions is in the parent directory name).\r\n\r\nAlso, PS Core is still _Microsoft_ PowerShell, just not _Windows_ PowerShell anymore.\r\n\r\nTo distinguish between the editions you have `$PSVersionTable.Edition` and `$IsCoreCLR`.\r\n\r\n",
