  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs an admin, I want to install PS 7 using the MSI in such a way that it becomes the default WinRM remoting endpoint on that server machine for all incoming WinRM-based PowerShell Remoting clients.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThis does need to be discussed in more detail (possibly as an RFC), based on the relative consensus reached on [my comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11616#issuecomment-594119801) in #11616, we should offer a sub-option of the \"Enable PowerShell remoting\" MSI option that also makes PS7 the default remoting endpoint (i.e. `microsoft.powershell`) and does something to preserve the existing Windows PS endpoints if they exist (e.g. migrating them to `microsoft.powershell.5`). \r\n\r\nAs a pre-req to this, it might be useful to have scripts in PSHome that do some of this work, and that provide reversability of the configuration, akin to what @jaykul proposes [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11616#issuecomment-598432849).\r\n",
