  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nHi all.\r\nWe have been banging out heads against PowerShell 7/Terminal windows on server 2022 and Win11 that simply do not type when keystrokes are entered.  \r\nThis happens exclusively when trying to type in a PowerShell window, running on Server 2022/Win11 Desktop or RemoteApp via AVD or RDS WebClient.  This happens even when running PS with in a cmd.exe session.\r\nNote - this happens in 5.1 as well for reference.\r\n\r\nAll input except PowerShell is working correctly.\r\n\r\nThis is me typing to a PowerShell 7/Terminal window via RDS/AVD using webclient.  There is no input.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72078919/181193356-d358a0b7-aaae-4e97-90b1-772c7cb6e193.png)\r\n\r\nThis is me typing to the same window via RDS/AVD not by webclient.  RDP works fine.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72078919/181191068-ddb0619c-dc0d-4621-991b-2aeac2a806c9.png)\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nTyping in PowerShell 7/Terminal should be reflected in the PS window\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nTyping in PowerShell 7/Terminal is not reflected in the PS window\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nNo errors or feedback of any kind\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.20348\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
