There are also only a handful of them which should make review easy.\n\nThese can definitely be squashed together. I'm slowly peeling them out from other categories...\n\nThe ErrorRecord commit might need to be dropped. Essentially that's changing an \"Error ID\" which might be considered a public API (I don't know).\n",
