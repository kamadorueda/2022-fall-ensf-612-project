It exists in BOTH Windows PowerShell (latest version) as well as PowerShell Core 6.1.\r\n\r\nPrior to the inclusion of the PSReadLine module, when typing at the PS command line, you could press the Insert key to toggle between insert mode and overtype mode. \r\n\r\nAfter the PSReadLine module was included, when typing at the PS command line you are always in insert mode and the Insert key no longer toggles between insert mode and overtype mode.\r\n\r\nInitially when I found this issue (years ago when PS-ReadLine was first introduced), I found that the Insert key did not have a Handler defined via Set-PSReadLineKeyHandler, however after doing more research it appears that there is no function available in PSReadLine to bind the key to which provides the traditional insert toggle mode that has existed since the DOS days at the command line and existed in PS before PSReadLine was introduced.\r\n\r\nPlease add the Insert key toggle mode to PSReadLine.\r\n\r\nAs a related issue, when viewing the Properties for a PowerShell instance on the Options tab, in the Edit Options, there is a \"Insert Mode\" checkbox which allows you to toggle whether the PowerShell instance opens in insert mode or overwrite mode.  This is also none functional as a result of that behavior missing from the PSReadLine module.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\nPress insert key and note that it does not toggle between insert mode and overwrite mode.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n``\r\nPress insert key and have it toggle between insert mode and overwrite mode.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",
