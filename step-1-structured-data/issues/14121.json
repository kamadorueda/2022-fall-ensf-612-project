  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nFramework Dependent builds support ReadyToRun. Just specify both rid and `--self-contained=false`.\r\n\r\nPersonally I always have the latest .net SDK installed, so I don't want to use the self contained release. It would be better in my case to use a `win-x64-fxdependent` with ReadyToRun enabled comparing to `win-fxdependent`.\r\n\r\nDon't know `win-fxdependentWinDesktop`.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/12450\r\n",
