  "body": "PowerShell SDK NuGet packages only have the 'System.Management.Automation.dll' as the reference assembly. This make it impossible to access any types from other powershell built-in assemblies like the `utility.dll`, `management.dll` and etc.\r\n\r\nIn my use case, I need `Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.JsonObject` to convert JSON to Hashtable in my application. But the type cannot be found because there is no such a reference assembly in the PowerShell SDK NuGet packages.\r\n\r\nFor example, both \"microsoft.powershell.sdk 6.1.0\" and \"microsoft.powershell.commands.utility 6.1.0\" have \"System.Management.Automation.dll\" only as the reference assembly.",
