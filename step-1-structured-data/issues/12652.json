  "body": "# Update MaximumHistoryCount limit from 32768 to INT32_MAX or so\r\n\r\nI'm a long time bash / zsh user and I've recently switched to working with PowerShell for my day job. One feature I've come to miss is the ability to have an unlimited (or functionally unlimited) command history size in [bash](https://www.soberkoder.com/unlimited-bash-history/) and [zsh](https://www.soberkoder.com/better-zsh-history/). The comparatively low maximum of 32768, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_preference_variables?view=powershell-7#maximumhistorycount) has become a problem for me recently as I've lost commands related to work I did a few months ago already. With bash / zsh, I'm able to grow my history file infinitely and thus can find commands from projects from ages ago, which helps when trying to dig up obscure shell incantations.\r\n\r\nI'm submitting this feature request to try to understand the reason for the low history count limitation, and to petition the PowerShell devs to increase it :).\r\n\r\nThe following is how I've increased my history limit to the current maximum (per [this](http://powershell-guru.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/maximumHistoryCount.png)). This is a line in `~/Documents/WindowsPowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$MaximumHistoryCount = 32767\r\n```\r\n",
