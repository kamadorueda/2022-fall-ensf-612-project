      "body": "It sounds like the `FailoverClusters` (module that contains these commands) haven't been marked as compatible with PSCore and thus runs in an implicit remoting session where any input/output are serialized. You can check this out by running the following to check the designated editions.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module FailoverClusters -PassThru | Select Name, Version, CompatiblePSEditions\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it doesn't say `Core` then you will need to run all your commands in 1 session to ensure the type information isn't lost like so:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$session = New-PSSession -UseWindowsPowerShell\r\n$info = Invoke-Command -Session $session -ScriptBlock { Get-CluserResource -Name 'File Share Witness' | Get-ClusterParameter }\r\n$session | Remove-PSSession\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnything in the `Invoke-Command` ScriptBlock is run in Windows PowerShell as well but instead of each individual command being run the whole pipeline is preserving the type information of the object.",

You are correct in that the designated edition doesn't specify core.\r\n\r\nRunning in the single session does the job though, thank you.\r\n\r\nHopefully this will be rectified soon so that this workaround doesn't have to be applied when dealing with this particular function.",

Unfortunately the real goal would be to have the `FailoverClusters` module updated/marked as `Core` compatible so it doesn't use the implicit remoting setup at all but that's down to the MS team who maintains that module :(",
