  "body": "When using `ConvertTo-Html -As List` colon is appended to the property name. While this inline with `Format-List` there should be some way of either to not append anything or allow a custom string.\r\n\r\nMy first thought is to add a switch to ignore appending the colon entirely. This keeps it non breaking and pretty simple but seems like a fix for a singular case.\r\n\r\nSecond idea is to have the delimiter defined as a global for both 'ConvertTo-Html' and 'Format-List' if it does not already exist. Default would be `:` and overridden when needed. This gives flexibility to both cmdlets.\r\n\r\nThird option might be letting both the property and value have its own script block expression. This would allow maximum flexibility beyond the colon use. One could wrap their property name or value in a tag, apply a class to it, etc. \r\n\r\nI know tis beyond the current scope but a having this cmdlet accept a Razor (.cshtml) view would be great addition later down the road.\r\n",
