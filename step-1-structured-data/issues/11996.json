  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nPowerShell Core is distributed not only as self-contained (with .Net Core Runtime dlls) but also as runtime-depended (without .Net Core Runtime dlls). This last one implies that PowerShell 7.0 can run on different .Net Core Runtime versions according to the major-verison roll-forward principle. This means that PowerShell 7.0 will work on any 3.\\*.\\* version including minor and patch updates. This may be important for troubleshooting and bug reporting.\r\n\r\nSuggestion is to add .Net Core Runtime version information in $PSVersionTable.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n [System.Runtime.InteropServices.RuntimeInformation]::FrameworkDescription\r\n\r\n.NET Core 3.1.1\r\n```",
