  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nI can feel people saying \"oh no, not another verb request\" But bear with me. \r\n\r\nI've been playing with creating crescendo commands for terraform. \r\nTerraform has the concepts of     \r\n**plan**  examine the desired state and current actual state and decide what needs to be done. \r\n**apply**  'Make it so' either by executing steps which were (optionally) saved at by a plan operation or planning steps on the fly. \r\n\r\n This can be shoehorned into PowerShell verbs by making \"plan\" a noun instead of verb, so we can \"create a New plan,\" instead of \"planning a deployment\". And we can \"Deploy a configuration\" (from a plan, or not).   \r\nIn fact doing what was prepared seems to fit existing verbs - if the authors of terraform had chosen, deploy,  import, merge,  publish, push, submit,  or update instead of \"apply\" no-one would have noticed, but there's nothing  to replace \"plan\"\r\n\r\nThere are other cases in data transformation, where there is a preliminary phase before data is imported/exported/saved/converted.  \"Prepare\" seems the most logical verb to me, right now, but there may be another which is just as suitable. \r\n \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nAdd a verb to the approved list.",

      "body": "@SeeminglyScience \r\n\r\nIn terraform there is command `plan`  which is \"compare desired state with actual state and determine steps to carry out\" - this can optionally output a file which holds those steps. Whether you output the file or not, it shows what it is going to do - this output can be JSON and doing stuff with crescendo I can turn that into something PowerShelly.  It's a _preview_ but not a `-WhatIf`  \r\n\r\nI can bend the meaning of it to \"Create a new plan file\" , but it if not file is specified it isn't creating a new anything so right now I _do_ have `New-TerraformPlan [-Outfile <path>]` but if don't supply a parameter it's not  creating something new, so it feels wrong.\r\n\r\nIf I create the plan file then the next phase _does_ fit into `deploy` -  what terraform calls `apply` is either \"run the steps in the plan file\", or \"plan the steps and immediately apply them\"  in the terraform case , and I think more generally, the \"Do the thing you prepared\" fits into existing verbs. \r\n\r\n@doctordns  - terraform comes from a whole other organization, they could have picked the imperative form of other verbs  for their commands. \"Apply\" could be replaced with others, but there isn't a ready alternative for \"plan\". It would need the product to be redesigned without that function, not just giving it another name.   \r\nI'm on record as saying Microsoft should fire anyone who tries to introduce a new, non-PowerShell command-line tool for Windows, so you can guess my take on winget from there.  \r\n",

      "body": "After looking at the documentation for Terraform (I have not used Terraform before). The `Build` verb could be used in place for plan. According to the documentation plan takes a set of input (configuration) and compares that to the current state of the system and builds a set of actions to get it into the desired state. Build also fits in nicely with the build and deploy model.\r\n\r\nIf a user runs `Build-TerraformPlan` and no changes are required it could return null as it would be in the desired state. If the system is out of compliance it could return an object of all the proposed changes. That could then be piped to `Deploy-TerraformPlan`. The user could also send the object/output to a file for later use.",

I still think Prepare is a good idea, but I may well use build for now. Thanks!\r\n\r\n**edit** after sleeping on it, I wonder if `build` is such a good idea when infrastructure is involved.  Does `Build-TerrafromPlan`  suggest that one takes the terraform config files and creates a plan file from them or does it suggest one takes the plan file  and creates the infrastructure from it?  I'm heading towards `New-TerraformPlan` having always creating a file unless -whatif is specified.  \r\n",

Don't get me wrong, we want folks to use approved verbs **when** there's a good fit.  But there isn't always a good fit.  There are so many problem domains out there where those users need verbs that better map to their problem domain instead of a bad force fit to approved verbs.  Either that or PowerShell starts accepting more verbs, but that seems like a never-ending issue.  Just my 2 cents.",

Easy to get wedded to a specific one (we still \"Format\" volumes which is the wrong sense of the word) \r\n `Get-Verb` gives 100 verbs and if the one I think it _should be_ isn't one of those or a synonym for one which flips easily - my first thought is that I'm describing the task poorly.
