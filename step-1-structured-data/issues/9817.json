Today the command retrieves all of the data from WMI and then filters the results based on the property names specified by the user.\r\nThis means that the following commands take the same amount of time to execute.\r\n\r\n````powershell\r\nGet-ComputerInfo\r\nGet-ComputerInfo -Property BiosCharacteristics\r\n````\r\nIn order to correct this I am storing the relationship between a WMI-queryable property and the WMI class to which it belongs in order to go from\r\n\r\n```SQL\r\nSELECT * FROM Win32_Bios\r\n````\r\nto \r\n````SQL\r\nSELECT BiosCharacteristics FROM Win32_Bios\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis PR is currently WIP since I have to add support for all of the properties a user can ask for but it sets the basic structure in place. I am hoping to get feedback on this general flow \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\n@powercode also suggested removing the filtering capability and having the user simply combine Get-ComputerInfo with Select-Object to obtain feature parity but this can be had in a separate discussion (just thought it might be interesting to restate).\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/9234\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n",
