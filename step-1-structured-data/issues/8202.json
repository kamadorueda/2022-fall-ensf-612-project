Waiting for a 401 is the best default. That 401 could offer digest auth, but you've lost that security gain if you've already sent basic credentials.\r\n\r\nPerhaps sending the basic credentials upfront could be a switch parameter, e.g. `-PreemptBasicAuth`, with documentation explaining the use case. It should only take effect if `-Authentication Basic` is specified, since it would compromise any other non-encrypted auth scheme, e.g. Digest. \r\n\r\nI'll have a go at this. ",
