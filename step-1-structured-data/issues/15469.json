  "body": "tldr; change default pwsh prompt to use OSC 9;9, so that people can create a new tab in Windows Terminal with same working directory as current tab.\r\n\r\n## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nwrt https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/8166 \r\n\r\nWindows Terminal recently added support for OSC 9;9 which is required for creating a new tab with the same working directory. How this works is that the prompt contains the path to the working directory wrapped in osc 9;9 which is used by the Windows Terminal to read the path and create new tab in same path.\r\n\r\nCurrently, people have to manually modify the powershell prompt to include OSC 9;9 like this https://gist.github.com/skyline75489/480d036db8ae9069b7009377e6eebb79\r\n\r\nIt would make it easier for people to make use of this feature if the default prompt for pwsh was updated to use OSC 9;9, then people won't require any manual changes, and things would \"just work\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to test the feature -\r\n=========================\r\nOpen Windows Terminal with pwsh profile in a directory and use the above linked prompt\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83939604/119833916-21fb3480-bf1d-11eb-993a-05f4801921ab.png)\r\nPress Ctrl-Shift-D\r\nThe new tab that opens will be in the same working directory.\r\n(If the prompt is not updated to use OSC 9;9, then it opens in the default directory of C:\\Users\\<user>\r\n",
