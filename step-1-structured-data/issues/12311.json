Implementing `unloop` would require either switching the code gen to use indexing *only* when that's possible and throwing otherwise, or allocating a whole new array just to support it.  It would also probably have to do this for every single `foreach` statement even if no `unloop` was used, or be very strict in how it can be used (no nested script blocks). ",
