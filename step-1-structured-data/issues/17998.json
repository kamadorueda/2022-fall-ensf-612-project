If someone could bump it, I would greatly appreciate it :)\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "PowerShell doesn't directly reference `Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool`. Instead, PowerShell references `System.Private.ServiceModel`, which depends on `Microsoft.Extensions.ObjectPool (>= 5.0.10)` even for its latest version (4.10.0).\r\n\r\nThe `[cgmanifest.json](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/17999/files#diff-2dbca354d25860d8a564159de6e6aa5be32423f7c475a9c120383d5df7c2d66a)` file is auto-generated to reflect the dependencies of PowerShell, which is then used to auto-generate our `ThirdPartyNotice`. So, it shouldn't be changed.\r\n\r\nIn you case, you may want to read [the \"Resolving dependency conflict\" doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/dev-cross-plat/resolving-dependency-conflicts?view=powershell-7.2#loading-through-net-core-assembly-load-contexts ).
