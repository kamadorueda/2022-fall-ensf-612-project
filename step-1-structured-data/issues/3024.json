  "body": "Close #2731 \r\n\r\n1. Rewrite Get-FileHash on C# and refactoring tests\r\nThe original Get-FileHash output type is `Microsoft.Powershell.Utility.FileHash`. The type was defined by ExtendedTypeDefinition. It is not C# type and reported as `PSCustomObject`.\r\nTherefore, the output type was changed and now it is native C# type `Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.FileHashInfo`.\r\n\r\n2.  Add new cmdlet Get-StringHash and add tests\r\nThe original idea was to add a InputString parameter to the common cmdlet but due to a conflict with the Path parameter (paths is strings too!) I had to make a new cmdlet to provide a pipeline support for the InputString parameter.\r\n",

We think the output needs the original object in addition to the hash.",
