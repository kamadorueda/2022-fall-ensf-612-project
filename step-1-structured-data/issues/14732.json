  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nIterating over multiple collections that have corresponding elements iteratively is a common scenario.\r\nThis is currently fairly cumbersome, so letting the `foreach` statement provide syntactic sugar would be a nice simplification (and would amount to a generalization of the pairwise [`Linq.Enumerable.Zip()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.Linq.Enumerable.Zip) method):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# 3 collections with corresponding elements('foo' relates to 'baz' and 'and', 'bar' relates to 'qux' and 'so on')\r\n$a = 'foo', 'bar'\r\n$b = 'baz', 'qux'\r\n$c = 'and', 'so on'\r\n\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING\r\n# Iterate over the corresponding elements from each RHS collection.\r\n# Note: Number of iterator variables must match the number of collections.\r\nforeach ($aElem, $bElem, $cElem in $a, $b, $c) { \r\n   \"$aElem, $bElem, $cElem\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above would yield:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nfoo, baz, and\r\nbar, qux, so on\r\n```\r\n\r\nand would be the equivalent of the (far more cumbersome) following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nforeach ($i in 0..($a.count-1)) {\r\n  $aElem, $bElem, $cElem = $a[$i], $b[$i], $c[$i]\r\n  \"$aElem, $bElem, $cElem\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nDue to its resemblance to destructuring assignments, I think the purpose of the syntax is easy to infer.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n* With _multiple_ iterator variables on the LHS  (which activates the new feature being introduced), their number would be required to match the number of explicitly listed collections (RHS); e.g.:\r\n  * `foreach ($aElem, $bElem, $cElem in $a, $b, $c) { ... }` ... VALID: 3 iterator variables, 3 collections\r\n  * `foreach ($aElem, $bElem in $a, $b, $c) { ... }`  ... INVALID: only 2 iterator variables vs. 3 collections\r\n \r\n   * The _single_-iterator variable (the currently supported syntax) would continue to function as-is; e.g.:\r\n\r\n     * `foreach ($elem in $a, $b, $c) { ... }` ... RHS is conceived as a *single* collection to iterate over directly, resulting in 3 iterations with `$elem` bound to the values of `$a`, `$b`, `$c` in sequence (irrespective of whether these variables contain scalars or collections).\r\n \r\n* The _largest_ among the RHS collections would drive the number of iterations, and the iterator variables would contain `$null` for those collections that have run out of elements.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackward-compatibility considerations: N/A, because the proposed new syntax currently results in a syntax error.\r\n",
