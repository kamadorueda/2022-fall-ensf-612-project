  "body": "Our main ReadMe.md contains Code Coverage Status. The badge looks wrongly due to caching (the badge display old information).\r\n\r\nFix from https://github.com/github/markup/issues/224\r\n> We're pretty confident that the image caching works. If you're having issues with something like a CI badge, make sure the image has the  Cache-Control: no-cache  header, and either  Expires ,  Last-Modified  or  Etag . \r\n\r\nOr workaround from https://github.com/codecov/support/issues/218\r\n```\r\n[![Coverage](\r\nhttps://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/chesslave/chesslave.svg?maxAge=600)]\r\n(https://codecov.io/gh/chesslave/chesslave)\r\n\r\nURL param  maxAge  does the trick. The value is expressed in seconds.\r\n```\r\n",
