  "body": "When you pass XML text via `-Content`, pretty-printing whitespace is _ignored_ in the resulting `XmlDocument` instance, which is consistent with .NET's default behavior (casting a string to `[xml]`, using [`System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.Xml.XmlDocument.Load))\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, using `-Path` / `-LiteralPath` to load text from a file treats the whitespace as significant.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create XML text with whitespace only between the element's\r\n# opening and closing tag.\r\n# Normally, this whitespace should be *ignored* on parsing.\r\n$xmlText = @'\r\n<elem>\r\n\r\n</elem>\r\n'@\r\n\r\n# Save the text to a file.\r\n$xmlFile =  \"temp:/$PID.xml\"\r\n$xmlText > $xmlFile\r\n\r\n# OK with -Content: whitespace is ignored.\r\n(Select-Xml -Content $xmlText '/elem').Node.InnerText | Should -Be ''\r\n\r\n# FAILS with -LiteralPath and -Path - whitespace is treated as significant.\r\n(Select-Xml -LiteralPath $xmlFile '/elem').Node.InnerText | Should -Be ''\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe 2nd test fails, because the use of `-LiteralPath caused the text to be parsed with whitespace preserved.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected strings to be the same, but they were different. \r\nExpected length: 0 Actual length:   2 Strings differ at index 0. \r\nExpected: '' But was:  '\\n\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-rc.2\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "By far the most common use case is to _ignore_ whitespace in element content, which is why the [`PreserveWhitespace `](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.xml.xmldocument.preservewhitespace) property defaults to `$false`.\r\n\r\nYou sensibly get this default when you cast to `[xml]` and when you use `Select-Xml -Content` (as well as with `XmlDocument.Load()`), so there is no good reason to deviate from that default with `Select-Xml -LiteralPath /  -Path` (this deviation isn't documented either, so I assume it is accidental).\r\n\r\nTherefore:\r\n\r\n* I would consider making `Select-Xml -LiteralPath /  -Path` exhibit the default behavior too a _bug fix_.\r\n\r\n* I don't think the whitespacing-_preserving_ behavior needs to be surfaced as a bona fide PowerShell feature; for this unusual need I think having to use the .NET methods directly is justified.\r\n\r\n",
