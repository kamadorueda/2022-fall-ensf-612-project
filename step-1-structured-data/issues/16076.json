  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAccording to the [documentation page for the Out-File cmdlet](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/7.1/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Out-File.md), the `-FilePath` parameter does not accept any wildcard characters. Yet, it does! The consequences are dire. Imagine running the following cmdlets:\r\n\r\n``` PowerShell\r\n' ' | Out-File -FilePath '.\\[1-4].txt'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI expect `Out-File` to try to create a file called `[1-4].txt`. This is a perfectly valid name in NTFS. If this file exists, overwrite it. This outcome is according to the documentation page too.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n1. If none of the following files exist: `1.txt`, `2.txt`, `3.txt`, and `4.txt`\r\n    `Out-File` throws the following unreasonable error: \"Out-File: Cannot perform operation because the wildcard path .\\[1-4].txt did not resolve to a file.\"\r\n1. If **one and only one** of the following files exist: `1.txt`, `2.txt`, `3.txt`, and `4.txt`\r\n    `Out-File` overwrites the file, unless `-NoClobber` is specified.\r\n    In complex situations, this could cause unexpected loss of data in files that should not be affected.\r\n1. If **more than one** of the following files exist: `1.txt`, `2.txt`, `3.txt`, and `4.txt`\r\n    `Out-File` throws the following unreasonable error: \"Out-File: Cannot perform operation because the path resolved to more than one file. This command cannot operate on multiple files.\"\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\nCase 1\r\n```\r\nException             :\r\n    Type       : System.IO.FileNotFoundException\r\n    Message    : Unable to find the specified file.\r\n    TargetSite :\r\n        Name          : ThrowTerminatingError\r\n        DeclaringType : System.Management.Automation.MshCommandRuntime, System.Management.Automation, Version=7.1.4.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35\r\n        MemberType    : Method\r\n        Module        : System.Management.Automation.dll\r\n    StackTrace :\r\n   at System.Management.Automation.MshCommandRuntime.ThrowTerminatingError(ErrorRecord errorRecord)\r\n    Source     : System.Management.Automation\r\n    HResult    : -2147024894\r\nTargetObject          : .\\[1-4].txt\r\nCategoryInfo          : OpenError: (.\\[1-4].txt:String) [Out-File], FileNotFoundException\r\nFullyQualifiedErrorId : FileOpenFailure,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.OutFileCommand\r\nErrorDetails          : Cannot perform operation because the wildcard path .\\[1-4].txt did not resolve to a file.\r\nInvocationInfo        :\r\n    MyCommand        : Out-File\r\n    ScriptLineNumber : 1\r\n    OffsetInLine     : 7\r\n    HistoryId        : 20\r\n    Line             : ' ' | Out-File -FilePath '.\\[1-4].txt'\r\n    PositionMessage  : At line:1 char:7\r\n                       + ' ' | Out-File -FilePath '.\\[1-4].txt'\r\n                       +       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    InvocationName   : Out-File\r\n    CommandOrigin    : Internal\r\nScriptStackTrace      : at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCase 3\r\n```\r\nException             :\r\n    Type        : System.Management.Automation.PSInvalidOperationException\r\n    ErrorRecord :\r\n        Exception             :\r\n            Type    : System.Management.Automation.ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n            Message : Cannot perform operation because operation \"ReportMultipleFilesNotSupported\" is not valid.

It's use is arguably limited though as it will fail if multiple matches are found.",

      "body": "@jborean93 Hi. The Principle of Least Astonishment is predicated on the fact that if you try hard enough, you can find some justification for everything after the fact.\r\n\r\nThe cmdlet's current behavior impedes the natural workflow of a system administrator because of its perverse (and definitely unintended) use of wildcards. To wit, wildcards are supposed to help select multiple files or folders, not make selecting one harder. This behavior, even if well-documented, does not lead to predictable script outcome. Rather, it acts as a form of a minefield that triggers instant-death\u2013style failure modes to scripts when the user least expects it.",

      "body": "@iSazonov By design or not, you have to appreciate all the unnecessary trouble it is giving us. Every time I wish to send a filename to PowerShell cmdlet, I have to use a helper function that scans the filename string for `[` and `]`. Once these characters are found, the function has to inject a number of backticks (<code>\\`</code>) depending on what cmdlet receives it. `Get-ChildItem` needs two, `Out-File` needs one! I've seen cmdlets that need three! Now, what's the justification for all this trouble imposed upon us? That in a galaxy far, far away, an app named `bash` accepts wildcards? That's extremely unfair!\r\n\r\nPlease look at this simple case of unjustified failure:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS > Get-Item *.txt | ForEach-Object { Set-Content -Value \"Test\" -Path $_.Name }\r\n```\r\n```Output\r\nSet-Content: An object at the specified path [AuthorName] Book 1.txt does not exist,\r\nor has been filtered by the -Include or -Exclude parameter.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince the script developer has no immediate visibility into the $_.Name, this comes as a complete shock. Even with visibility, they need to know that PowerShell doesn't resolve the `[` and `]` at the parser level.\r\n\r\nI am open to the suggestion that perhaps you and the PowerShell Committee have a style guide regarding how to script safely and bracket-consciously, but I'm not sure if they are documented anywhere.",

For example, and application could have a directory structure like `app/settings-00000000-0000-0000-C000-000000000046/config.json` where the latter half of the folder name is a machine unique guid.
