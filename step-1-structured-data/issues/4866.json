  "body": "Code is creating a DirectoryInfo instance to determine if the path is a directory or file, but it fails because `*` is not allowed, however, `*` is a valid character in a registry path.  Fix is to catch this exception and ignore it.  This means that using `-literalpath` with an asterisk and the filesystem provider will now return an error rather than returning quietly.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4704\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4330\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
