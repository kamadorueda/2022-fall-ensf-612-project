  "body": "Good evening\r\n\r\nI wonder that starting a PowerShell Session (and cmd, too, but thats another inexplicable annoyance) as Administrator uses System32 as it's working Directory. \r\nI'm pretty sure there is almost no situation where the User will have to work in System32 and we probably never change Files in this directory by an interactive PowerShell Session.\r\n\r\nTherefore it makes no sense to use this Directory.\r\nThe Linux way is once more much more useful: /root. I can even delete /root - and there is no danger for the System. If I make a mistake in System32 - which can happen - then I've probably got a problem.\r\n\r\nMaybe, you could use something like \r\n`Join-Path $env:USERPROFILE 'PowerShell'\r\n`\r\nor just\r\n`c:\\Temp\r\n`\r\nKind regards, Tom\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nCtrl-Click the PowerShell Icon\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nUse a save working place (working directory) if PowerShell is started. Always.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nIf PowerShell is started, it uses System32 as it's working directory.\r\n\r\n",

PowerShell Core is not a Windows binary, so your \"Start In\" directory will be honored if the shortcut points to PowerShell Core instead of Windows PowerShell.",
