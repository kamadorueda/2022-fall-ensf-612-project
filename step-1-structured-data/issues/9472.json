Remove the installed version from:\r\n    - on windows '$env:LOCALAPPDATA\\Microsoft\\dotnet'\r\n    - on macOS and linux '$env:HOME/.dotnet'\r\n2. Run Start-PSBootstrap or Install-Dotnet\r\n3. Start-PSBuild -Clean\r\n````\r\n\r\nI don't want to break VS2019, or to revert to VS2017.\r\n\r\nIs there a means to work around this issue?\r\n",
