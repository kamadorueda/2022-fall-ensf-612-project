  "body": "I write few command every time when I open powershell at global level. For example doing npx create-reacta-app abcd.\r\n\r\nIt can be anywhere. What I am looking for is when I started typing npx, it show something with grey text and if I press the Tab, the text will be set into the current line.\r\n\r\nThis could be quite useful. In few case on mac I see this thing, What is helpful here is I don't need to type everything by hand again. Just tab will type everything.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "The UI aspect of providing a _preview_  of tab-completion values _before_ pressing the tab key has previously been requested in this PSReadLine issue: https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/issues/741.\r\n\r\nCreating _custom_ tab completions is already available to you as part of PowerShell itself, not PSReadLine, via the `Register-ArgumentCompleter` cmdlet; here's a quick example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nRegister-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName npx  -ScriptBlock {\r\n    param($wordToComplete, $commandAst, $cursorColumn)\r\n\r\n    # Simply return the expanded parameter name, if a match is found.\r\n    'create-react-app',\r\n    'other-command'  -like \"$wordToComplete*\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, typing `npx <tab>` will complete `create-react-app`, and `other-command` if you press tab again; typing `npx c<tab>` would only complete `create-react-app`.\r\n\r\nI suggest you close https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/issues/1126 and give https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/issues/741 a thumbs-up.\r\n",
