I have tried latest version of Powershell using \r\n\r\nbrew cask install powershell.\r\n\r\nI am able to start powersehll with pwsh command after that I Install module using Install-Module MSOnline and Imported module with Import-Module MSOnline after that whenever I tried to run the command Connect-MsolService. I get following error message\r\n\r\nConnect-MsolService: Could not load file or assembly 'System.IdentityModel, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'. The system cannot find the file specified.\r\n\r\nI have install .net SDK 5 to see if that solved the problem but it did not. Following is the $PSVersionTable command\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.4\r\nOS                             Darwin 20.6.0 Darwin Kernel Version 20.6.0: Wed\u2026\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nConnect-MsolService command should work\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nConnect-MsolService: Could not load file or assembly 'System.IdentityModel, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089'.
