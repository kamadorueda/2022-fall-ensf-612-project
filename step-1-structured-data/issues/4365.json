  "body": "**Ilya Sazonov (@iSazonov)** is the most active contributor to the PowerShell Core project not employed by Microsoft and has been doing so since it was first unveiled as Open-Source. \r\nHe brings a thoughtful and well-reasoned perspective to the project and has consistently delivered Pull Requests of increasing complexity while also performing Pull Request reviews, commenting on issues, and setting a good example of engagement with an Open-Source project.\r\n\r\nIlya has earned the trust of the existing PowerShell Repository Maintainers through his diligent work and is an excellent candidate to be a steward of the project.\r\n",
