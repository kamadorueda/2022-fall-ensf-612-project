      "body": "`Get-Content` reads a file as string data, it has no PDF or image handling. I'm not sure what you'd reasonably expect to get as output if you called `Get-Content` on a PDF file, they're decidedly not plain text files.\r\n\r\nAlso, `Out-Printer` doesn't seem to be cross-platform, so I'm not sure if there is a great deal of interest in maintaining it / rewriting it in future. \r\n\r\nAs for `Start-Process -Verb Print`, this will only work if you've assigned a default PDF handling application in your Windows settings. If you have, that print task would be handled by your PDF application, typically.\r\n\r\n",
