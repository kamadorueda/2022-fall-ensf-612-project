  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nBITS has many advantages over the `Invoke-WebRequest` cmdlet, but there doesn't seem to be any way to set a custom `User-Agent` header, like `Invoke-WebRequest` has (`-UserAgent`).\r\n\r\nThis means that whenever I'm downloading a file from a server where I need to change my `User-Agent` (e.g. some software distribution sites provide the file directly for well-known user agents like `Wget`, but show a website with download button for other user agents), I have to use `Invoke-WebRequest` instead of `Start-BitsTransfer`.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to add a similar parameter to `Start-BitsTransfer`?\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
