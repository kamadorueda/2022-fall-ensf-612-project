Connect to Exchange server following\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/exchange/exchange-online/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell/connect-to-exchange-online-powershell?view=exchange-ps\r\n\r\nI suspect that any remote session with cmdet's will do\r\n\r\nPut the session in `$Session`\r\n\r\n2. `Import-PSSession $Session`\r\n3.  Run `Get-Help Add-AvailabilityAddressSpace` (any cmdlet name will do)\r\n4. Observe that everything works as expected - help is outputted\r\n5.  Run this remote command, the significant part is `-First 1` - this is what breaks stuff for some reason. I guess it has to do with how select-object interacts with remote pipeline \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \r\n\r\nFull demo (sorry, it got a little bit long)\r\n\r\n![get-help-remote](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/816680/40883467-d2911736-66b2-11e8-828e-020acf3cd7b3.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nHelp should not break\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nGet-Help : Get-Help could not find Add-AvailabilityAddressSpace in a help file in this session.

      "body": "I guess it has to do with the following:\r\n\r\n>Beginning in Windows PowerShell 3.0, Select-Object includes an optimization feature that prevents commands from creating and processing objects that are not used. When you include a Select-Object command with the First or Index parameters in a command pipeline, Windows PowerShell stops the command that generates the objects as soon as the selected number of objects is generated, even when the command that generates the objects appears before the Select-Object command in the pipeline. To turn off this optimizing behavior, use the Wait parameter.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/3.0/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/Select-Object.md#description\r\n\r\nUPD: workaround with using `-Wait` fixes this behavior.",
