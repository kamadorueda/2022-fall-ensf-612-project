  "body": "I have worked with the `PackageManagement` team over the last months to migrate from a compilation against `netcoreapp2.0` (which is not supported any more but still working) and `netstandard1.6` to compile against `netstandard2.0` instead. PRs that were a pre-requesite for this transition are already approved and merged, the final PR to switch over to `netstandard2.0` has now been merged [here](https://github.com/OneGet/oneget/pull/424).\r\nOnce `PackageManagement` releases this change in an upcoming release to the PowerShell Gallery, it will be a breaking change for the WiX installer, which has the DLLs and paths hard-coded [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/assets/files.wxs#L1763) and therefore will need to be updated.\r\nI suggest to remove the `netcoreapp2.0` folder in the `coreclr` folder and rename the `netstandard1.6` folder to `netstandard2.0` (the number of DLLs and their names remains the same)\r\nAlso: is it possible to remove the `fullclr` folder or would this cause a problem due to a hash mismatch?",
