  "body": "The correct use of a PowerShell host is that, given somescript.ps1, it's filename is added via powershell.AddScript somescript.ps1 , also wise to resolve said filename. Made   file do the same. Made *.ps1 scripts recognized as such when run like `powershell.exe somescript.ps1`  deprecating the explicit need for   file .
