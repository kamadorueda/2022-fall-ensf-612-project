Of course, go ahead and submit an issue, definitely don't take my best guess as gospel; if there's a demand out there I'm sure they can figure out how to allocate resources to fill it sooner or later.\r\n\r\nIf you want this functionality it will likely be easy enough to find a third-party DLL and use that from PowerShell.",
