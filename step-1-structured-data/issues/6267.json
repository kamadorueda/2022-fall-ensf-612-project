Going forward, rather than putting a bunch of issues in 6.x only to move them to 6.x+1, all non-critical issues that we believe should be addressed will be in the `Future` milestone.  There is no guarantee *when* an issue will be fixed, but the more up votes the higher the priority (depending on risk of changes, even a high priority issue may not be fixed quickly).  I'll review all the current `6.0.0-NiceToHave` issues and will move them either to `Future` or no milestone (which means undetermined).",
