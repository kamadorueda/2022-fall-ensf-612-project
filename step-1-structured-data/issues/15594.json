  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nI try to use as many of the new operators in PS7 as possible but I sometimes find myself in an unwinnable situation\u2026\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s say I logically want this:\r\n```pwsh\r\n$a = $emptyStr || $emptyStr2 || $real\r\n```\r\nWhere `$a` gets the value of `$real` because the first 2 or falsy\r\n\r\nthat doesn\u2019t work. It sets it to `$emptyStr` because pipeline chain ops only relate to exit code basically\r\n\r\nSo then I think ok whatabout `-or`?\r\n```pwsh\r\n$a = $emptyStr -or $emptyStr2 -or $real\r\n```\r\nbut unfortunately that turns `$a` into a boolean\u2026 So then I think ok how about the `??=` operator:\r\n```pwsh\r\n$a = $emptyStr\r\n$a ??= $real\r\n```\r\nbut no\u2026 that ends up with an empty string because `$a` has a value of empty string and `??=` only works if it\u2019s `null` which I think makes sense personally.\r\n\r\nI _could_ do ternaries:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n$a = $empty ? $empty : $empty2 ? $empty2 : $real\r\n```\r\nbut that's evil. So then I go back to old reliable:\r\n```pwsh\r\n$a = if($emptyStr) { $emptyStr } elseif($emptyStr2) { $emptyStr2 } else { $real }\r\n```\r\nbut it\u2019s just so much extra text.\r\n\r\nHere's the scenario I was actually trying to solve in GitHub actions where I'm trying to consolidate values in a few places into one centralized output:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n          $releaseBranch = '${{ steps.get-release-branch.outputs.release_branch }}'\r\n          $passedInBranch = '${{ github.event.inputs.vscodebranch }}'\r\n\r\n          $branch = if ($releaseBranch) {\r\n              $releaseBranch\r\n          } elseif ($passedInBranch) {\r\n              $passedInBranch\r\n          } else {\r\n              'main'\r\n          }\r\n\r\n          Write-Host \"Branch to use: $branch\"\r\n          Write-Host \"::set-output name=chosen_branch::$branch\"\r\n```\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nidk... in TypeScript `||` and `&&` also handle truthy/falsy stuff so that to me is ideal... but I guess a different operator like `-eor` or `-eand` maybe for backcompat.",

      "body": "@237dmitry yeah, you've characterised your example correctly.\r\n\r\nI think the issue with that is that it requires a cmdlet to be executed and to succeed or fail to use PowerShell's `&&`/`||` operators. You can think of those operators as conditional semicolons; they proceed from statement to statement on condition of success or failure. If you're trying to just coalesce to some default value, that's cumbersome, computationally expensive, and relies on the notion of execution state (rather than a conceptually pure expression).\r\n\r\nRather than shoulder that complexity, it would be nice to just have a way to coalesce expressions directly:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$fake -eor $fake2 -eor 'Failure'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile I think more on it, it turns out you can kind of do something similar with the existing boolean operators:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$null = ($result = $fake) -or ($result = $fake2) -or ($result = 'Failure')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat takes advantage of (1) the result of the assignment occurring before conversion to boolean, (2) the value of an assignment statement being the value of the assigned value for the purposes of a subpipeline, and (3) the short-circuit logic of boolean operators.",
