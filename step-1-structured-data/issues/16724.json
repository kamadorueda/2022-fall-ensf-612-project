  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nCurrently, when Get-ChildItem returns a file size, it's in bytes\u2014even if the size is several terabytes.  bash lets users specify the `-h` switch to ls.  In Powershell, it's more complex as Get-ChildItem doesn't know anything about the data.  Adding the switch would cause the method to prefer human readable sizes.  The switch would look for a property named `Length` and replace that in the select with `LengthAsStr` (if that exists in the class) which would be assumed to be human readable.\r\n\r\nThe second step would be to arrange with the authors of `System.Io.FileInfo` and `System.Io.DirectoryInfo` to add `LengthAsStr`.\r\n\r\nI considered saying that Get-ChildItem itself could attempt to convert the field, but `Length` might be in something other than bytes, say characters.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
