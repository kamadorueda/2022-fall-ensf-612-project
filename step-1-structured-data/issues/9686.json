Both 6.2.1 and 6.1.4 are servicing releases handling the recently-filed CVE issues for 6.2 and 6.1; both were updated as both are still officially supported. I'm assuming the 6.2.1 was released first, probably only by a minute or two, but because the 6.1.4 was released after it, Github flags it as the \"latest release\".",
