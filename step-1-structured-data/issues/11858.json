      "body": "> I wonder what are you going to fix if you haven't repo steps?\r\n\r\nRepro steps are possible, but I don't feel they are necessary.\r\n\r\n- Do you agree that a collection can not be modified during enumeration? If yes, there is an invalid piece of code. For now I don't need to care under what circumstances it will be executed. It could be even unreachable, or exist only for completeness or readability. Even so I don't think a bug is very readable.\r\n\r\n- A bug is serious enough if it can be directly observed through codes. Why do you need reproduce steps to see it or prove it? #11862 is declared to be a \"fix\", do you need repro steps for it as well?",
