But, you got me closer. \r\n\r\nI realized I didn't try:\r\npowershell -c ./test.ps1\r\nor \r\npowershell ./test.ps1\r\n\r\nThey both work.  The issue started when I was looking at the powershell -help which doesn't show an example to run a script file. This example need to be added to the help.\r\n\r\n![powershellbashscript](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19892435/20822891/a7520ea4-b81c-11e6-932e-d54fd95ee5a0.png)\r\n\r\n![powershellbashscript1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19892435/20822893/ae3fb5c2-b81c-11e6-82cf-8e1f7dff2e6d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
