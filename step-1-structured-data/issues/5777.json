  "body": "Requiring the build use the produced program makes packaging for rolling release distributions extremely difficult. It also makes the trusted software set larger for all distributions. Ideally, PowerShell should be buildable using only C# and a common command interpreter. That the build scripts are only available in PowerShell does not make a great deal of sense and seems slightly sophomoric.\r\n\r\nMany projects suffer from complexity in this vein, like Haskell/Stack, Perl6, etc. Recently added to that list are dotnet and PowerShell.\r\n\r\nI was originally going to add this to UserVoice, however having seen the many ways this problem manifests (due to my involvement with Gentoo) I think this should be given the minor level of additional priority that a bugtracker lends.",
