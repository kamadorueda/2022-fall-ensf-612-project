      "body": "@thorsig bit of a different issue there. The alias `ps` that points to `Start-Process` in Windows editions of PowerShell (including recent versions of PowerShell 7 GA) is not actually present in linux, due to there being a native `ps` executable that many folks use. \r\n\r\nThat executable only ever emits string data, so `ConvertTo-Json` can only treat it as such.\r\n\r\nWhat you seem to be wanting is still achievable with `Get-Process | ConvertTo-Json`. \ud83d\ude42 \r\n\r\nIf you instead want the text output from `ps` to be interpreted as some kind of object, you need to provide that conversion yourself; cmdlets in PowerShell can't afford to make any assumptions about the expected format of string data without breaking other users' assumptions in the process. It's for a similar reason that many very useful aliases were removed for Unix editions of PowerShell; many Unix users got very upset that PowerShell was \"taking over\" these native executables with its aliases and producing (for them) unexpected behaviour when using familiar commands.",
