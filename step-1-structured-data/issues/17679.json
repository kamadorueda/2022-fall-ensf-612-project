      "body": "While the `-Name` parameter can find a service by the display name if you use the full name it doesn't do wildcard matching on it. The wildcard matching only occurs on the actual service name and the one you are seeing in the GUI most likely doesn't start with `sql`. If you want to match by displayname you can use the `-DisplayName` parameter which also accepts wildcards.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Service -DisplayName 'sql*'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will explicitly match based on the service display name rather than the name itself. As for whether pwsh should match wildcards on displayname using the default `-Name` parameter considering it accepts it as the full value I'm torn. From a consistency it would be nice but it also opens up a whole bunch of problems when it comes to do we display all the matches for both labels or should it keep the matches per type. I personally think it should keep the behaviour as is but maybe expand the docs a bit more to explain it.",
