  "body": "Add a script named Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 to install pwrshplugin.dll and activate the WInRM endpoint for that version of PowerShell Core. The script must be run from within that instance of PowerShell and run with Administrator privileges. \nThe script shall:\n1. Copy pwrshplugin.dll to $env:windir\\system32\\powershell<version>\n2. Create the remoting configuration file\n3. Register the endpoint with WinRM.\n\nThis is a short-term fix for issue #1193. That issue still specifies the desired long-term experience.\n",
