      "body": "I've been experiencing the same problem even in PS 5 -- Downloading the Windows 10 ISO as of three days ago and doing a fresh install gets you PowerShell 5.1 with these same help topics, and `update-help -force` doesn't download any more of them.\n\nPS 4 (on a fresh Server 2012 R2 install) seems to include everything.\n\n**EDIT:** I did another test and noted that 2012R2 (PS4) includes only a couple of about_ topics until Get-Help is run for the first time. Then it downloads the full set.\n\nWhat I'm not clear on now is: How does `Update-Help` know what the core about topics are and where to find them? Is that what's missing between PS 4 and 5? The Update-Help documentation says it downloads help files for _installed modules_. Are the core `about_` topics considered to be in a module, or is this something different? If so, which module is it, and could Update-Help request it specifically with `-FullyQualifiedModule`?\n\nI'm trying to figure out how to fix this manually on my Windows 10 machine. Should it be possible for me to correct some kind of help manifest that is currently missing the the online locations for the core about topics?\n",

      "body": "After looking at this earlier and looking between what the differences are between PowerShell v4 & v5+ (on 2012R2) it seems that the issue is that the help cab file for Microsoft.PowerShell.Core doesnt include the about_\\* topic files for WMF 5 has been installed\n\nThis means that machines that have had WMF4 & have had Update-Help run on them which were then upgraded to WMF5 (WinX -> Win10) will have the core about_\\* topics where as machines that started on WMF5+ are missing them (confirmed on 3 different Win10 builds, a 2012R2 machine updated to WMF5 & a 2012R2 machine updated to WMF5.1 Preview)\n\nI have a fix for this which essentially has zipped up the about_\\* topics from a new 2012R2 build on Wmf4 that has then had Update-help run and made this zip file available at https://github.com/kilasuit/Install-AboutHelp  & the Install-AboutHelp.ps1 is available on the PSGallery as well via Find-Script Install-AboutHelp\n\nIdeally the cab file should be updated from the 5.0.7.0 version to 5.0.8.0 and re-include the about_\\* topic files \nThis also brings another point up about open sourcing these files as well  cc @joeyaiello \n",

The same issue was also present for some module help files (like PSScheduledJobs), and once I combined this with @kilasuit's excellent solution, I think my help files are finally back to the level of functionality they had prior to WMF 5.\n",

      "body": "I don't really have the expertise to say this with confidence, but it _appears_ that as of today, update-help will pull down all of the missing about_\\* topics, as well as those for the PSScheduledJob and PSWorkflow modules, HOWEVER they will be missing the `.help.txt` extension (and so be unusable without additional tweaks), AND all of the text spacing and formatting in these files is completely broken compared to the WMF 4-era equivalents. Here's an excerpt from about_Execution_Policies:\n\n### 9-30-2016:\n\n```\nUSE GROUP POLICY TO MANAGE EXECUTION POLICY\n    ------------------------------------------- You can use the \"Turn on Script\n    Execution\" Group Policy setting to manage the execution policy of computers\n    in your enterprise. The Group Policy setting overrides the execution\n    policies set in Windows PowerShell in all scopes.\n    The \"Turn on Script Execution\" policy settings are as follows:\n    -- If you disable \"Turn on Script Execution\", scripts do not run. This is\n    equivalent to the \"Restricted\" execution policy.\n    -- If you enable \"Turn on Script Execution\", you can select an execution\n    policy. The Group Policy settings are equivalent to the following execution\n    policy settings.\n    Group Policy                Execution Policy ------------               \n    ---------------- Allow all scripts.          Unrestricted\n    Allow local scripts         RemoteSigned and remote signed scripts.\n    Allow only signed           AllSigned scripts.\n    -- If \"Turn on Script Execution\" is not configured, it has no effect. The\n    execution policy set in Windows PowerShell is effective.\n```\n\n### 9-30-2014\n\n```\n USE GROUP POLICY TO MANAGE EXECUTION POLICY\n -------------------------------------------\n    You can use the \"Turn on Script Execution\" Group Policy setting\n    to manage the execution policy of computers in your enterprise. \n    The Group Policy setting overrides the execution policies set in Windows\n    PowerShell in all scopes. \n\n    The \"Turn on Script Execution\" policy settings are as follows:\n\n    -- If you disable \"Turn on Script Execution\", scripts do not run. \n       This is equivalent to the \"Restricted\" execution policy.\n\n    -- If you enable \"Turn on Script Execution\", you can select an\n       execution policy.
