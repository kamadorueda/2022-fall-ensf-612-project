  "body": "The command `dotnet run` builds and runs in one shot (given the `Linux.Host` project), negating the need to build with scripts (at this point wrappers around `dotnet publish`).\n\nHowever, the last piece of the puzzle is to have `libpsl-native.so` deployed as project content automatically, and this is blocked on dotnet/cli#710. We've worked around by building and copying in `build.sh`, but it will be nice to deprecate this.\n",
