Is this just from a few that I follow but if it is openly used elsewhere (with decent success too) are there any examples of this at all?\n\nOtherwise I'd be more for suggestively pushing people to the powershell slack team with a dedicated channel??\n",

If Microsoft were to pay for the \"Standard\" [Slack pricing tier](https://keys-tlocd.slack.com/pricing), message storage would be unlimited with a 10GB limit on file storage.\n",

So we have quite a few channels and it's no big deal to switch between them.
