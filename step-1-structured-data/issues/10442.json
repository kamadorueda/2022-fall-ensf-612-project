  "body": "I was looking to stop searching a file after the first match, expecting `Select-String -First 1`.\r\n\r\n`Select-String | Select-Object -First 1` can stop the pipeline, and skip searching the rest of the file. This is fine, but later I found there *is* a parameter to Select-String which stops after the first match, and outputs the match information, it just has the not-obvious name `-List` (where did that come from?).\r\n\r\nIt is the only cmdlet in Core, Management, Utility modules with a `-List` parameter, difficult to guess what it does by analogy with other cmdlets. There are only two with a `-First` parameter (Select-Object and Import-CliXml), but one of them  is used very often, so that's probably what set my expectation.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: could it be aliased to `-First` (and maybe `-First $Num`) for easier discoverability and easier guessing what it might do?",

By default, `Select-String` returns a MatchInfo object for each match it finds.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would agree that `-List` was a poorly chosen switch name.  `-First` would make sense, but this is a switch and not a parameter so it doesn't take arguments which is different from `Select-Object -First`.  It could be `-FirstOne` to make it more specific (perhaps slightly redundant...).\r\n",

      "body": "As @KirkMunro  points out, the detailed help is not exactly helpful as it appears to completely miss the point of this option.  To amplify what he said, the point of `-List` is to _list all of the files that contain the specified pattern_. That's why it's `-List` and not `-First`. It returns the first match because it has to return something and the `MatchInfo` object has the file name it in it so why not. WRT aliases, they give another name to a parameter they don't and can't change it's type. Adding a new `-First N` (and `-Last N`?) parameter would seem to be the way to go.. ",
