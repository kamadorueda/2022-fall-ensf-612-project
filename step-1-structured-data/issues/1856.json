  "body": "This change adds StdError handling for the new SSH transport so that any connection failure from SSH will be reported to the user.  Currently a connection failure results in a \"hang\" and Ctrl+C is needed to close the (not yet connected) session.\n\nSSH also returns warnings through StdError and these are filtered so that the session is not unnecessarily closed.\n",
