  "body": "The dotnet-core and aspnetcidev feeds provide all our required packages.\nThe aspnetvnext causes `dotnet restore` to take an inordinate amount of\ntime, which terminates our CI builds.\n\nReducing the number of feeds brings restore time from scratch down to 3\nseconds on my machine.\n\nThe aspnetvnext feed was originally added for the CoreCLR xUnit runner\npackages; but is no longer necessary.\n\nResolves #896.\n",
