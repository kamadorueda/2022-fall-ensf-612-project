  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI updated to v7.3.0 yesterday and suddenly every time I type something Powershell prints some \"suggestion\" text on the line in front of my cursor.\r\n\r\nI guess that's what it is. It doesn't seem to function the way I would expect. Typing `<tab>` doesn't autocomplete the suggestion, and instead inserts _some other_ text. Is it a preview of what `<F8>` would do?\r\n\r\nI have no idea, but it is immensely distracting. Most of the time I am typing a _new_ command; if I wanted to press `<F8>`, I would press `<F8>`.\r\n\r\nEven worse on a color scheme such as the embedded shell inside VS Code, I can hardly tell the difference between what I'm typing and this new \"suggestion text\".\r\n\r\nHow can I turn this off?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> foo|\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> foo| blah blah blah blah and other distracting stuff\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.3.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.3.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
