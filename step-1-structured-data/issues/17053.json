      "body": "> Launch any .msi file within powershell core command window.\r\n\r\nCan you share how you are launching it. Are you launching the msi directly or through msiexec? Are you using `Start-Process` or just like `PS C:\\> C:\\path\\to\\my.msi`?\r\n\r\n> I also noticed that the $env:temp value is altered to include a folder path of 1 i.e. C:\\users<username>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\1 where the system defined value does not include this folder in the path for $env:temp\r\n\r\nTypically env vars are just inherited from the parent that launched PowerShell. When you run through certain logons, like RDP, compared to a direct console logon; Windows will add the suffix. For example when I login through RDP the temp path ends with `\\2`.\r\n\r\nEdit: just saw your latest update sorry for the noise.",
