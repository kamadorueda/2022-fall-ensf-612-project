FAILS, due to the trailing path separator in the -NewName argument\r\n  { Rename-Item Bar/ Baz/ }  | Should -Not -Throw\r\n\r\n} finally {\r\n  Pop-Location\r\n  Remove-Item $tmpDir -Recurse\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nBoth tests should pass.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe 2nd test fails:\r\n\r\n\r\n[...] Cannot rename the specified target, because it represents a path or device name.
