  "body": "Fix #2310\n\nThis is because we were casting the result expression to an object before casting it to the enum type.\nIf the target enum type has `System.Int32` as underlying type, then the cast of `(int-enum)(object)(int)` works in C#.\nBut if the target enum type has `System.Byte` as underlying type, then the cast of `(byte-enum)(object)(int)` fails in C# with error \"Specified cast is not valid\" in FullCLR, and \"Unable to cast object of type 'System.Int32' to type\" in CoreCLR.\n\nThe fix is to cast the expression to the enum type before casting it to object.\n",
