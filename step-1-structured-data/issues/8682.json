It would be good to have a public API for conversion to JSON. This PR refactors the `ConvertTo-Json` cmdlet to move the core implementation to `JsonObject.ConvertToJson`, and make `ConvertTo-Json` call that public method.\r\n\r\nThis would help the Azure Function PowerShell worker. Currently, we depends on [calling the cmdlet](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-powershell-worker/blob/729710d2595b4b96abd4fa5a5547fe880e98bfa6/src/PowerShell/PowerShellManager.cs#L198-L205) to convert object to JSON which is expensive. Once we have the public method `JsonObject.ConvertToJson` exposed, we can call the API directly to avoid a command invocation.\r\n\r\n## PR Context  \r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [ ] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.  \r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**  \r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [x] [Add `[feature]` to your commit messages if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

      "body": "@iSazonov This PR is purely a change on how code is organized, in order to expose the `convert-to-json` functionality through a public API similar to the existing `JsonObject.ConvertFromJson`. Updating old code to make it better/faster is not a goal.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the changes, I suggest to focus on the new APIs, how `ConvertToJsonCommand` is changed to depend on `JsonObject`, and how `ConvertToJsonContext` is used within `JsonObject`.
