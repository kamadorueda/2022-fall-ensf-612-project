This makes it impossible to implement `PSHostUserInterface` for both PS 7.1 and any earlier PowerShell version. Instead we get a `TypeLoadException`.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of this is here: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/12782#discussion_r464724652\r\n\r\nYou can find the Host UI implementation (which works today with PS 7.0 and PS 5.1) [here](https://github.com/rjmholt/PowerShellEditorServices/blob/async-ps-consumer/src/PowerShellEditorServices/Services/PowerShell/Host/EditorServicesConsolePSHostUserInterface.cs).",

We can decide in a new PR whether we reuse the original code or to go with a different implementation.",
