This allows module authors to indicate compatible `PSEditions` without limiting module compatibility to 5.1+ by using `CompatiblePSEditions`.\r\n\r\nIf `CompatiblePSEditions` or tags are not for a module in $PSHOME it will add `Core` and if the module is in Windows in-box it will add `Desktop`.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Current\r\nPS C:\\> Get-Module -ListAvailable | Where-Object Name -eq Pester | Select-Object -First 1\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\r\n\r\nModuleType Version    PreRelease Name                                PSEdition ExportedCommands\r\n---------- -------    ---------- ----                                --------- ----------------\r\nScript     4.9.0                 Pester                              Desk      {Describe, Context, It, Should\u2026}\r\n\r\n\r\n# New\r\nPS C:\\> Get-Module -ListAvailable | Where-Object Name -eq Pester | Select-Object -First 1\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\Program Files\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\r\n\r\nModuleType Version    PreRelease Name                                PSEdition ExportedCommands\r\n---------- -------    ---------- ----                                --------- ----------------\r\nScript     4.9.0                 Pester                              Core,Desk {Describe, Context, It, Should\u2026}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes #11927 and #7856\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
