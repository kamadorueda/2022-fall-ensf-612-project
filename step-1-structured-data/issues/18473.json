  "body": "## Changes Summary\r\nAdded PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference to initial session state vars, added description for the variable to the runspaceinit.resx file, added tests which cover expected functionality. \r\n\r\nThe PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference variable now only accepts values All, ModuleQualified, None. All other variable assignments will error out as shown through the tests. Intended to resolve https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12037\r\n\r\n## Slight User Experience Change\r\n\r\nI've marked this pull request as WIP as there is a bit of a hidden behavior change that will occur as a result of the change:\r\n\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1020\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-11-05 at 12 54 59 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66397912/200131938-4f7c70ab-efd8-48d1-8e8e-af716ca3dbfa.png\">\r\n\r\nShown above is the GetCommandDiscoveryPreference which is used for all accesses to the PSModuleAutoloadingPreference variable in the codebase. With my new change, the PSModuleAutoloadingPreference variable will be set by default. So the result variable in the code above will never be null and we will always enter the first if block and return the preference. The dilemma here is that, with this new change, we would now longer be checking the user\u2019s environment variables to see if they already had the preference set before setting the default value to \u201cAll\u201d when the pwsh terminal starts up. This is a behavior change that could potentially break things for some users.\r\n\r\nI see two paths forward: \r\n- Continue with the change as is, setting the initial value for PSModuleAutoloadingPreference to \u201cAll\u201d regardless of the user\u2019s current environment variable when the shell starts up. This is ultimately what the documentation here https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_preference_variables?view=powershell-7.2#psmoduleautoloadingpreference suggests the behavior should be and that is the change I recommend. \r\n- When setting the initial value for the PSModuleAutoloadingPreference variable, first check the environment variable and, if the user doesn\u2019t have it set, set it to \u201cAll\u201d otherwise defer to what they've already set. This will keep the current behavior exactly identical to what it is now and potentially prevent breaking changes in case some users are still depending on their autoloadingpreference being set via their current environment variables. However, this behavior would not be consistent with what is stated in the documentation above. \r\n\r\n",

PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detected.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoia2FkZW5ybyIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xODQ3MyIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic1VwIn0=&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoia2FkZW5ybyIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xODQ3MyIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6Ik5ldXRyYWwifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoia2FkZW5ybyIsIlJlcG9zaXRvcnlMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbCIsIlB1bGxSZXF1ZXN0TGluayI6Imh0dHBzOi8vZ2l0aHViLmNvbS9Qb3dlclNoZWxsL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvcHVsbC8xODQ3MyIsIkV2ZW50VHlwZSI6IlRodW1ic0Rvd24ifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",
