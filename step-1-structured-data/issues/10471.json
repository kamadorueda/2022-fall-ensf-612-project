  "body": "For a real-life case of the behavior described being problematic, see [this StackOverflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/57734162/45375), where a user puzzles over ashorcut-file-launched PowerShell window instantly closing, despite use of `-NoExit`.\r\n\r\nNote: The correct behavior is debatable, but to me it makes more sense to give more weight to `-NoExit` -  i.e. to the request to open _an interactive shell_ - over erroring out due to not being able to find the script file targeted (as long as the command line is otherwise _syntactically_ correct).\r\n\r\nNote that passing a broken _command_ with `-Command` already behaves that way; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\npwsh -nop -noexit -c '1 / '  # new session is still entered, despite broken command.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nEnter interactively, one line after the other:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$PID\r\npwsh -noprofile -noexit -file ./nosuchscript.ps1\r\n$PID\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n<PID of calling shell>\r\n<error message about not finding the script>\r\n<PID of *new* shell>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, a new shell should _always_ be entered, since the command line was _syntactically_ correct and `-NoExit` was specified.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n<PID of calling shell>\r\n<error message about not finding the script>\r\n<PID of calling shell>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**That is, despite `-NoExit`, the new process _exited unconditionally_**, due to not finding the script specified as the `-File` argument.\r\n\r\nNote that, by contrast, if the script _can_ be found and throws a terminating error, the shell is (rightfully) _not_ exited.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.3\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.18362.145 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1903, OS Build: 18362.295)\r\n```\r\n",
