  "body": "See also:  #12632, #12644, #12645\r\n\r\nNote: Changing this would be a breaking change. That said, the current behavior is unhelpful, so the suggested change likely falls into [Bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area).\r\n\r\nWhile you can pass a file _path_ to `Get-Command`, _any_ existing file - even if it isn't an executable (let's call it a _document_) - is currently reported as command of type `Application`.\r\n\r\nThe sensible behavior would be the following: Only return a file as a `System.Management.Automation.ApplicationInfo` instance:\r\n\r\n* on Unix-like platforms:  if `test -x` for that file has an exit code of `0`; that is, if the file is an executable from the OS' perspective _and_ is executable by the current user.\r\n\r\n* on Windows: if the file's extension is listed in `$env:PATHEXT`\r\n\r\nOtherwise, a non-terminating error should be reported, as is already done for non-existent commands.\r\n\r\nIt isn't useful to end users to report _any_ file item as a _command_, let alone as a command of type `Application`, as is currently the case (use `Get-Item` to get information about non-executable files).\r\n\r\nConversely, reporting only true executables (files that the OS considers directly executable) is helpful on Unix-like platforms, given that executables typically have no filename extension at all, and even if they do it isn't the extension that determines executability, it is the permission bits.\r\n\r\nIn short: It is helpful to distinguish actual executables (from the OS' perspective) from _documents_ that PowerShell - as a syntactic convenience - allows passing _to_ an executable, implicitly (e.g., `./foo.txt` being the same as `Invoke-Item ./foo.txt`). That PowerShell currently allows invoking _documents_ by _mere file name_ (`foo.txt`) _via `$env:PATH`_ (only), is a related, but separate problem - see #12632.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n'hi' > t.txt\r\n{ Get-Command -ea Stop ./t.txt } | Should -Throw\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected an exception, to be thrown, but no exception was thrown.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason is that the non-executable `t.txt` file was actually reported as type `Application`.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.2\r\n```\r\n",

Profile in the example **is** a command of type \"External Script\" so that is ok. \r\n\r\nFoo.xlsx is processable in Excel , and `start Foo.xlsx `has been valid for longer than we have had XLSx files. (I think `start .` worked in the Windows 95 version of command.com, but I don't trust my memory on the point.)  Does working with start serve as a good proxy for  _ is an application_ ?  Typing \r\n`$path = foo.xlsx`\r\nWhen I mean \r\n`$path = 'foo.xlsx'`\r\ntells windows to start foo.xlsx and we take a pause while excel opens, so powershell is treating it as a command to run and the console output (none) goes into $path. \r\n\r\n\"If I can start it, it counts as an application\" might be OK as a rule except that` get-command C:\\windows\\system32\\aadauthhelper.dll` reports an application and you can't start a DLL.  \r\nIdeally there should be another command type for \"launchable data file\" \r\n\r\nTechnically a breaking change because someone might use get-command instead of test-path,  but you could make it less so by returning \"non-executable\" if the input is a path and the path isn't something you can run. \r\n",

In the best-case scenario, it's an unhelpful feature that one won't use, in the worst-case scenario you'll mistakenly operate on the wrong file.\r\n\r\nNeither does it make sense to report documents as `Application`s, or indeed to have `Get-Command` report them as commands at all.\r\n\r\nIn short: While a breaking change, I think the impact would be minimal (though I haven't try to analyze code out there):\r\n\r\n* It's hard to imagine anyone relying on opening _documents_ via `$env:PATH`.\r\n\r\n* Reporting documents as _commands_ (`Application`) is unhelpful at best - and on Unix-like platforms gets in the way of implementing the proposed useful behavior (see OP).\r\n\r\n  * Incidentally, even currently combining a wildcard _path_ with `-CommandType Application` misbehaves - see #12644.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@jhoneill \r\n\r\n> Splitting hairs here, it doesn't say it is an executable.\r\n\r\nI should have said \"command\", which is a superset of \"executable\" (as a noun; as an adjective, it is the core quality of a command).\r\n\r\nA simple way of conceptualizing the distinction I'm after: a command is a _verb_ (\"do something\"), a document is a _noun_ (\"a thing\").\r\n\r\nIrrespective of what the original design intent was, observing this distinction is helpful, for the reasons outlined above.\r\n\r\nThe utility (CUI)  vs. application (GUI) terminology has always been blurry on Windows, where the term \"console application\" is common, but I don't think that is relevant here.\r\n\r\nApplication _data files_ are unequivocally what I've called _documents_ above, distinct from the actual application _executables_, i.e., files containing executable code as recognized by the system.\r\n\r\nTherefore, from the perspective of the command / document distinction, documents shouldn't be considered commands at all, and `Get-Command` shouldn't report them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
