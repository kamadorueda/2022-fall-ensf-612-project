      "body": "To add a couple other points: \r\n\r\n* this doesn't buy you much from a readability perspective when you can't indent the lines between the opening and closing operators, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction foo {\r\n        $a = @\"\r\nSome text\r\nthat can't\r\nbe indented.\r\n        \"@\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* it may be a reasonable user expectation that if they had a trailing amount of whitespace, that it'd be included in the here-string, e.g.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction foo {\r\n        $a = @\"\r\nSome text\r\nthat can't\r\nbe indented.\r\n        \"@ # why wouldn't the whitespace on this line be included?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* given that we don't get additional indentation in the content of the here-string, \"good enough\" readability is achievable with this syntax:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction foo {\r\n        $a = \r\n# inline python code cares about whitespace\r\n@\"\r\nif 1 == 1:\r\n    print(\"yes\")\r\nelse:\r\n    print(\"no\")\r\n\"@\r\n}\r\n```",
