  "body": "In WinRM-based remoting sessions, `$PSSenderInfo.ConnectionString` contains the actual connection URL used.\r\n\r\nIn SSH-based remoting sessions it seems to contain the _fixed_ value `http://localhost`, which is misleading. Conversely, SSH connection information is not provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nMake sure that SSH-based remoting is enabled on a test machine running a Unix-like OS (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/ssh-remoting-in-powershell-core)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-Command -Hostname (hostname) { $PSSenderInfo.ConnectionString } |\r\n  Should -Not -Be 'http://localhost'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should pass.\r\n\r\nAn `ssh:`-based URL should be reported.\r\n(Not sure whether one is actually used, but _some_ meaningful representation of the SSH connection should be used.)\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, because fixed string `http://localhost` is _always_ reported.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected 'http://localhost' to be different from the actual value, \r\nbut got the same value.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core v7.0.0-preview.6\r\n```\r\n",
