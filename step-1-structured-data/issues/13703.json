  "body": "I am building a PowerShell module in c#. I have 2 class files. The first class looks a bit like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System.Management.Automation;\r\nusing System.Management.Automation.Host;\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nnamespace foo\r\n{\r\n    class bar\r\n    {\r\n        protected override void ProcessRecord()\r\n        {\r\n            Host.UI.Write(\"Foo\");\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat works fine. Now in the second class file I get this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nusing System.Management.Automation;\r\nusing System.Management.Automation.Host;\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\nnamespace foo \r\n{\r\n    class noob\r\n    {\r\n        public static void DoSomething()\r\n        {\r\n            Host.UI <= The Name 'Host' does not exist in the current context\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat am I doing wrong?",
