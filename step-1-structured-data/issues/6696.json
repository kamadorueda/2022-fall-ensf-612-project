  "body": "Homebrew and Macports are the two most popular package managers for macOS.  Unfortunately it's bad practice to coexist MacPorts and Homebrew, How some love for Macports users?  \ud83d\ude00 \r\n\r\nIn practice, adding support for Macport based installation of Powershell would be very similar to the workflow you have for cask development and publication. You can check out the Macports contributor guide here: https://guide.macports.org/chunked/project.contributing.html \r\n\r\nA deployment could be spun up quickly enough, by converting the instructions found here into a portfile: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell-core-on-macos?view=powershell-6#binary-archives\r\n\r\nAnywhoo, this should have the Issue-Enhancement, OS-macOS, labels applied to it.\r\n\r\nHere's the Docs:\r\nMacports Contributer Guide: https://guide.macports.org/chunked/project.contributing.html \r\nPhases of Macports installation: https://guide.macports.org/chunked/reference.phases.html\r\nPortfile Development: https://guide.macports.org/#development\r\nPortfile Reference: https://guide.macports.org/chunked/reference.html\r\n\r\nHere's the Repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/macports/macports-ports\r\n\r\nHere's some user commentary:\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/21374366/what-is-the-difference-usage-of-homebrew-macports-or-other-package-installation/21375370#21375370\r\nhttps://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/32724/what-are-pros-and-cons-for-macports-fink-and-homebrew\r\n\r\nNote: I'm a humble sysadmin, packing is far removed from my skillset, so I've simply done my best to apply due-diligence in locating references in the hope that i can keep powershell core up-to-date in a simple way using a very established package manager for the macOS ecosystem.",
