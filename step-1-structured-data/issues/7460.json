  "body": "Currently, there are a number of workarounds in the code base to handle the fact that logging needs to occur before the -SettingFile argument is parsed.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n* https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6085 - Logging is initialized before the configuration file is processed\r\n* https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/7449 - Make sure that -SettingFile arg is parsed before we load the settings\r\n\r\nWhile these changes workaround specific issues, we still have areas where logging settings are ignored due to logging before the logging settings in the setting file is parsed.  PR 7449 presents a possible fix by parsing the -SettingFile argument earlier in command-line parsing. This change would move this logic to moving this logic to UnmanagedPSEntry.Start and avoid any further issues.\r\n\r\nThe call should be placed immediately before PSEtwLog.LogConsoleStartup(), the call should then be unconditional, and the conditional call in ConsoleHost can be removed.\r\n\r\nAlso revisit the SetSnapInLoggingInformation(coreMshSnapin) in PSSnapInReader.ReadCoreEngineSnapIn which is currently disabled on UNIX due to this issue.",
