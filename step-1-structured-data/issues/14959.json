      "body": "Possible? Sure, anything's possible.\r\n\r\nI doubt it's very likely, though. Part of PowerShell's versatility stems from .NET, and I think at least at the moment it would be hazardous at best, if not entirely detrimental, to replace core functionalities with Rust code instead.\r\n\r\nIt would probably be simpler to write a new scripting language shell in Rust from the beginning, to be honest.",

There are a lot of areas for improvement in the code base, but if it were rewritten in rust (assuming that was feasible in the first place) to the exact same level of quality then performance probably wouldn't be that different.",
