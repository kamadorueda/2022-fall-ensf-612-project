      "body": "@iSazonov  The problem with putting this in the docs is that few people read the docs.  That said, it's better to have in the docs than nowhere.  :-)  But at some point, I suggest we either add a `.vscode\\settting.json` for this project or perhaps even better, add a `.editorconfig` file in the root dir.  This is a config file that supports multiple editors.  VS 2017 supports this file and VSCode does if you install the `EditorConfig` extension.  \r\n\r\nThis brings me to my next suggestion.  Consider adding a `.vscode\\extensions.json` file which will prompt VSCode users to install the \"recommended\" extensions for this project.  Perhaps with contents like this:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n    // See http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=827846\r\n    // for the documentation about the extensions.json format\r\n    \"recommendations\": [\r\n        \"ms-vscode.csharp\",\r\n        \"ms-vscode.powershell\",\r\n        \"EditorConfig.editorconfig\"\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```",

That is, a user might prefer tabs to spaces but this project uses spaces.  So adding that setting to an editor config file will ensure that spaces are used for this user in only this workspace.  In his own projects, tabs will still be used.",
