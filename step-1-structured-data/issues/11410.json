  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nGet-Date should support ISO 8601 to return in UTC. Currently the `-format s` option returns in ISO 8601 but local time.\r\nThere should be a new option which formats including the timezone.\r\n\r\ne.g. instead of `2019-12-20T08:48:05` in UTC +1, it should be `2019-12-20T07:48:05Z`\r\n\r\nhttps://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "S is a short cut for \"SortableDateTimePattern\" which is defined in the current culture. \r\nIt is equivalent to  adding  .tostring((Get-Culture).DateTimeFormat.SortableDateTimePattern)\r\n\r\nThe .Net formatter seems to do some odd things. e.g.  `[datetime]::now.tostring(\"r\")\r\n`Will append \"GMT\" to the converted date time regardless of the timezone it came from \r\n\r\n`[datetime]::now.tostring(\"HH:mm zzz\")` returns the offset information, e.g. _13:25 +01:00_\r\n\r\nBut the **formatter** doesn't seem to have a method for converting local time to universal time or vice versa. It needs to be done before the formatting is applied.  \r\n`[datetime]::now.ToUniversalTime().tostring(\"HH:mm zzz\")`\r\n\r\n**Ideally Get-Date would have -UniversalTime  as a switch.** \r\n",
