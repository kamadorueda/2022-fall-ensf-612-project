Should be able to define custom colors for Progress, Error, Verbose, etc... and package it as a theme.",

PLUS, we shipped a new tool to allow users to load color \"schemes\" if they prefer (esp. useful to those who're color-blind/sensitive).\r\n\r\nIf PowerShell was to fix its palette use to use color[0] as background, etc. rather than color[5], it'd be able to enjoy the palette improvements we've made ;)",
