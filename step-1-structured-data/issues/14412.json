But just wonder:\r\n```\r\nScript will test 10 computers at the same time. If the 10 testing finish at the same time, and try to add the IP address to online.txt at the same time,  seems it will be a conflict, as 10 sessions try to access the same file, will it causes some sessions give up the addition of IP address.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 6.3.9600\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
