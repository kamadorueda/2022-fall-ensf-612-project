  "body": "This enables full cross-platform support (Linux, OS X, and Windows), using `dotnet-cli` to produce a self-contained PowerShell build.\n\nIt is very rough around the edges, especially the console. However, over 500 of our Pester tests pass on Windows.\n\nNote that this includes #11 and so the emitted executable is `bin/powershell`. This also bumps the PowerShell submodule.\n",
