  "body": "This downloads installs the v0.2.0 version of PowerShell for Ubuntu on Travis. It then builds the development PowerShell using `Start-PSBuild` instead of `./build.sh`.\n\nThus, `./build.sh` is deprecated and can be removed when all developers are comfortable doing so.\n\nThis is the preliminary step to finishing #678.\n\nBy the way, Travis's CLI was slightly out-of-date.\n",
