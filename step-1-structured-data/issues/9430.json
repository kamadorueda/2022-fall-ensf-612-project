  "body": "On Windows, `$env:PATHEXT` defines the filename extensions that should be directly executable, based on their associated file-type definition.\r\n\r\nIf the file-type definition happens to define a _console-subsystem_ application, that application is - as expected - executed in the _current_ console window.  \r\nAn example is extension `.exe` and running, say, `findstr.exe`.\r\n\r\n**It makes sense for the same logic to apply to _extension-less_ filenames**, _if_ they are marked as executable, after having added (non)-extension `.` to `$env:PATHEXT`:\r\n\r\n**Supporting direct execution of extension-less files is useful for emulating support for Unix-like scripts that specify their associated interpreter by their _shebang line_ only**.\r\n\r\nWith a suitable file-type definition mapped to `.`:\r\n\r\n* Invocation of extension-less files already works as expected in `cmd.exe`.\r\n\r\n* In PowerShell, the associated application is _invariably_ executed in a _new_ console window - even if it is a _console_ application.\r\n\r\n**The root cause is likely #7769**, which also causes problem in the context of `npm` use.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Direct invocation of extension-less files by filename only actually works even _without_ `.` present in `$env:PATHEXT` in PowerShell (but, as stated, invariably in a _new_ console window).\r\nHowever, #9469 proposes that this be disallowed, so as to restrict by-filename-only invocations to file types explicitly designated as _executables_ (rather than _documents_).\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce (Windows only)\r\n\r\n* Run the `Install-ShebangSupport.ps1` from [this Stack Overflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55619189/45375) to install support for direct execution of extension-less shebang-line-based scripts. (Run `Install-ShebangSupport.ps1 -Uninstall` to uninstall later.)\r\n\r\n* Create extension-less script `foo` in the current dir. with a `pwsh` shebang line:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\"#!pwsh.exe`n'hello, world'; read-host\" > foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n* Invoke the script:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n.\\foo\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe script should execute in the _current_ console window, print `hello, world`, then wait for <kbd>Enter</kbd> to terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe script executes in a _new_ console window.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 6.2.0 on Windows\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Looks like PowerShell already executes extension-less files, by passing them to Explorer.  I bet PowerShell is matching the EXACT command name (without extension) first and sending it to Explorer, and then Explorer is finding a means to execute it, such as you already have a handler set for extension-less files that reads the shebang?   Otherwise I cannot see how your script would be causing a new window to open.",

      "body": "Now its coming back to me, PATHEXT is the list of extensions that CMD/PowerShell (or Windows) will attempt to append to the end of an extension-less command name and then search the PATH to see if it exists.   Adding `;.` to PATHEXT is meaningless to PowerShell it seems, since PowerShell already checked for it without an extension (but CMD does not).   Maybe that is a separate issue yet?  It appears both Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell Core 6.2 exhibit this behavior.  I could understand this being normal on 'nix, but not expected on Windows.",

PowerShell, due to the exact file-path match (curiously only with _absolute_ paths) thinks that the companion file rather than the executable one is to be opened, and hands the companion-file path to `ShellExecute`, which invariably executes in a _new_ window but _does_ execute the `.cmd` file, after all.\r\n\r\nThat is, in the absence of a filename extension in the specified path, the Windows shell  (`ShellExecute`) prioritizes _executables_ over _documents_.\r\n(The question then arises how to instruct `ShellExecute` _not_ to look for a file with an executable extension and use the path verbatim in order to open the companion file - at least I _hope_ that is possible.)\r\n\r\nPowerShell should do the same, which in the presence of `.` in `$env:PATHEXT` would mean _not_ passing the file path to `ShellExecute` and attempt direct execution in the _current_ console window, as would happen for, say, a `.py` file.\r\n(I can't tell whether there are any technical challenges.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
