Specifically, all the files in `contentFiles/any/any/runtimes/unix` are missing signatures.\r\n\r\nWe are an internal MS team depending on this Nuget and are experiencing build failures due to missing signatures in the mentioned files.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nThe files should be signed\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nThe files are not signed\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22621\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

After our project is built, the scans in our pipeline report these files as malicious since they are not signed.\r\nWe have to account for this scenario as well. Maybe signatures in these files will not be validated when they are being used as it is in non-Windows, but that should be fine as the files would be signed for other consumers, like us.",
