  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\n\nRun the following PowerShell:\n\n$choices = @()\nforeach ($i in 0..20){\n    $choice = New-Object System.Management.Automation.Host.ChoiceDescription \"Choice &$i\",\"Choice $i\"\n    $choices += $choice\n}\n$index = $host.ui.PromptForChoice(\"\", \"\", $choices, 0) \n$choices[$index]\n## Expected behavior\n\nSee the following output and be able to select a choice with the number hotkey e.g. \"18\":\n\n[0] Choice 0 [1] Choice 1  [2] Choice 2  [3] Choice 3  [4] Choice 4  [5] Choice 5  [6] Choice 6  [7] Choice 7  [8] Choice 8  [9] Choice 9  [10] Choice 10  [11] Choice 11  [12] Choice 12  [13] Choice 13  [14] Choice 14  [15] Choice 15  [16] Choice 16  [17] Choice 17  [18] Choice 18\n[19] Choice 19[20] Choice 20  [?] Help (default is \"1\"): 18\nLabel      HelpMessage\n\n---\n\nChoice &18 Choice 18\n\nNote that the hotkeys are the full number used in the script loop. Expecting that when a number is used as the hotkey, the whole number is retained and usable.\n## Actual behavior\n\nSee the following output:\n\n[0] Choice 0 [1] Choice 1  [2] Choice 2  [3] Choice 3  [4] Choice 4  [5] Choice 5  [6] Choice 6  [7] Choice 7  [8] Choice 8  [9] Choice 9  [1] Choice 10  [1] Choice 11  [1] Choice 12  [1] Choice 13  [1] Choice 14  [1] Choice 15  [1] Choice 16  [1] Choice 17  [1] Choice 18\n[1] Choice 19[2] Choice 20  [?] Help (default is \"1\"): 18\n\n18 isn't a valid option as there is no hotkey \"18\". There are however many hotkeys of \"1\".\n\nThe hotkeys have been truncated to a single character, resulting in odd behaviour once the number used for the hotkey gets above single digits. You cannot use hotkeys above single digits and have to use the full choice description e.g. \"Choice 18\"\n## Environment data\n\nName                           Value\n\n---\n\nPSVersion                      5.1.14393.82\nPSEdition                      Desktop\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\nBuildVersion                   10.0.14393.82\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n",
