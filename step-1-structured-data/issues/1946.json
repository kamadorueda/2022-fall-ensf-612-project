The client also uses libnss-extrausers that loads clusterwide user info from an NFS store, but because it is a built-in authentication extension, the origin of this user data should remain invisible to consuming code, so long as they resort to correct auth methods. (I have no idea how to do it exactly, but all Linux utils automagically work.)\n\n`````` powershell\nName                           Value\n----                           -----\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha\nPSEdition                      Core\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.9\nCLRVersion\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1```\n``````\n",

At least on current beta-1 builds it's no longer an issue (and has been for the past 5-6 builds or so).\r\n\r\nThe only problem now is that the console is pretty much useless when used over SSH. After pressing every key, it prints the content of the line thus far in a new line, but this is a separate issue. Happens both with PowerShell/Open-SSH and the one that ships with Git for Windows. (In slightly different ways)\r\n```Powershell\r\nPS /home/mnagy> PS /home/mnagy> g\r\n                PS /home/mnagy> gc\r\n                PS /home/mnagy> gci\r\n```",
