  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nHere is the dotnet issue: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/66746\r\nHere is the breaking change note: https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/28720\r\n\r\nBasically, `System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping` doesn't support specifying payload on Linux:\r\n- it throws `PlatformNotSupported` exception when custom Ping payload is specified, when the process is not running as root.\r\n- even if running as root (sudo), the custom payload is simply ignored because on Linux it's implemented by interfacing with the `ping` native utility, which doesn't support specifying custom payload.\r\n\r\nSo, whatever functionality in `Test-Connection` that depends on specifying custom payload is broken and should be either fixed or removed.\r\n\r\n**Attention**: Workaround was added to test code in `Test-Connection.Tests.ps1` by https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/16930. Please fix the tests when resolving this bug, or removing the related tests if the affected functionalities will be removed.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nN/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nN/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nN/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell 7.3-preview.3\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "My read of the linked issue and related issues/PRs seems to indicate that the _content_ of a custom payload is ignored, but the _size_ of the payload is still passed to the `ping` native util if running as root or with proper capabilities (permissions?) set on the calling process.\r\n\r\nSo I guess the question here is -- is this enough of a feature that we think it worth keeping for that (kinda narrow imo) use case, and wrap the error that comes up to tell the user to run pwsh as root if they want to use the relevant parameter? Or do we just compile this on Unix systems without that parameter entirely / ignore it if it's set?",
