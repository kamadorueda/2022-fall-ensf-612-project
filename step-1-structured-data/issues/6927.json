  "body": "This issue is opened to discuss the change made in #5839 and its possible consequences.\r\nOriginally made to fix #5752 (avoid wildcard expansion in working folder path when opening new session), it also has other effects that require more careful evaluation.\r\n*(following is the copy of my original comment)*\r\n\r\nSomething with implemented fix still bothers me.\r\nWhen started playing with v6.1.0-preview.2, I realized that `Get-ChildItem` is also affected by this change.\r\nAnd everything else using wildcard expansion now has added complexity - conditional branch with try-catch *(what kind of performance overhead it might also have, btw?)*\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\ps_test> Get-ChildItem\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\ps_test\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd-----       24.05.2018      2:03                [ab]a\r\nd-----       24.05.2018      2:03                aa\r\nd-----       24.05.2018      2:03                ba\r\n\r\n\r\nPS C:\\ps_test> Get-ChildItem [ab]a\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\ps_test\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd-----       24.05.2018      2:03                [ab]a\r\n\r\n\r\nPS C:\\ps_test> Get-ChildItem [abc]a\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\ps_test\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd-----       24.05.2018      2:03                aa\r\nd-----       24.05.2018      2:03                ba\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this might even make it work as expected more times than before, it has an increased [level of surprise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment). It might make issues caused by the use of `-Path` instead of `-LiteralPath` to show up less frequently but will make them harder to trace when they finally show up.\r\nUsing wildcards by default and literal path as an option was a major design mistake, imo. This patch makes a step back, but in a way that makes it less predictable. Is it OK to have more \"magic\"?\r\n\r\nI also wonder why the fix was made in this way instead of just calling `Set-Location` with `-LiteralPath` when initializing a session? Working folder is by definition a literal path. It would've kept behavior changes to minimum.",
