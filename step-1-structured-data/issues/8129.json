  "body": "<sup>Related: #6989</sup>\r\n\r\n_Casts_ from _strings_ use the _invariant_ culture whenever the underlying type has a static `::Parse()` method that accepts an `IFormatProvider` parameter.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, the `-as` operator does _not_ exhibit this behavior and instead exhibits _culture-sensitive_ behavior, but does so _inconsistently_.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[cultureinfo]::CurrentCulture = 'fr-FR'\r\n\r\n[double] '1,2.3'\r\n'1,2.3' -as [double]\r\n\r\n[datetime] '10/20/2018 1:22:33 AM'     # OK, invariant culture is used.\r\n'10/20/2018 1:22:33 AM' -as [datetime] # Yields $null, because the *current* culture is used.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n12,3\r\n12,3\r\n\r\nsamedi 20 octobre 2018 01:22:33\r\nsamedi 20 octobre 2018 01:22:33\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n12,3\r\n12,3\r\nsamedi 20 octobre 2018 01:22:33\r\n# !! No output, because the string wasn't recognized as a date.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, `-as [datetime]` only works with strings that are formatted according to the rules of the _current_ culture; `'20 octobre 2018 01:22:33' -as [datetime]` would work, for instance.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, `'1,2.3'` _was_ consistently interpreted according to the rules of the _invariant_ culture (where `,` is the grouping char., and `.` the decimal mark; with `fr-FR` in effect, the culture-sensitive `[double]::parse('1,2.3')` would fail).\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 6.2.0-preview.1 on macOS 10.14\r\nPowerShell Core 6.2.0-preview.1 on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core 6.2.0-preview.1 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1803, OS Build: 17134.165)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.17134.228 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1803, OS Build: 17134.345)\r\n```\r\n",
