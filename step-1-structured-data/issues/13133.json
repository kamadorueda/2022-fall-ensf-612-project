You should definitely try reporting it to WSL, or open an issue in https://github.com/microsoft/terminal asking about this, and maybe they can point you to the right place.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/100060912/dc77b180-764a-11e9-9e12-aace7d0ecd7d\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/terminal\">microsoft/terminal</a></strong></div><div>The new Windows Terminal and the original Windows console host, all in the same place! - microsoft/terminal</div></blockquote>",
