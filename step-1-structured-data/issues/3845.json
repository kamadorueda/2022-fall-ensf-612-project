  "body": "As currently implemented, the engine special cases completion for hashtables to provide completion for Format-*, Select-Object, Sort-Object etc. As soon as the token is `AtCurly` we call our internal method `CompleteHashtableKey` that only completes parameters for build in cmdlets.\r\n\r\nHowever, this removes the possibility to write custom completers for \r\n`Get-Awesomeness -Settings @{ <tab>` or `Get-Awesomeness -Settings @{ ForeColor = <tab>`\r\n\r\nWe shouldn't short circuit parameter completion when we are completing external cmdlets.\r\n\r\nThis applies to all PSVersions.",
