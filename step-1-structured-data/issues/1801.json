  "body": "I found the note regarding the dotnet CLI version misleading. I initially had compile errors due to an unrelated issue and spent a good chunk of time trying to ensure the dotnet cli 1.0.0 was installed. On a clean VM, after `start-psbootstrap` running `dotnet` produces:\n\n```\nPS C:\\dev\\powershell> dotnet\n\nMicrosoft .NET Core Shared Framework Host\n\n  Version  : 1.0.1\n  Build    : cee57bf6c981237d80aa1631cfe83cb9ba329f12\n```\n\nSo I thought this may have been my issue but it actually was not and once I worked out my real issue, this version worked fine.\n",
