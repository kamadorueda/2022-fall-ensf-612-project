  "body": "Related: #2993\r\n\r\n# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n`Get-Location` already supports a `-PSProvider` parameter that allows you to specify the provider context explicitly rather than relying on the provider that happens to underlie the current location.\r\n\r\n`Convert-Path` / `Resolve-Path` should  support this parameter too, so that full native / full PS paths can be obtained relative to a _given provider's_ current location without having to rely on the current location.\r\n\r\nIf this parameter were added, the following tests should pass:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Set the current filesystem location.\r\nPush-Location Temp:\\\r\n$null > ($tmpFile = \"$PID.txt\")\r\n\r\n# Switch to a different provider\r\nPush-Location Env:\\\r\n\r\n# Resolve a path relative to the filesystem provider to an absolute native path. \r\nConvert-Path -LiteralPath $tmpFile -PSProvider FileSystem | \r\n  Should -Be (Join-Path (Get-Location -PSProvider FileSystem).ProviderPath $tmpFile)\r\n\r\n# Resolve a path relative to the filesystem provider to an absolute PS path.\r\nResolve-Path -LiteralPath $tmpFile -PSProvider FileSystem | \r\n  Should -Be (Join-Path (Get-Location -PSProvider FileSystem).Path $tmpFile)\r\n\r\nPop-Location\r\nRemove-Item $tmpFile\r\nPop-Location\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI presume there's potential for reuse of the existing code in `Get-Location`.\r\n",
