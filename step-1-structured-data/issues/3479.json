  "body": "The hang issue in parser tests was due to a bug in Unix version `crosgen`, and it was worked around via #3191.\r\n\r\nAs described in #3191, we want to run parser tests in CI builds without the corssgen'ed powershell assemblies, and skip those tests in night builds with crossgen'ed powershell assemblies. However, #3191 didn't completely disable those parser tests in the nightly builds, because many of them run through the helper function `ShouldBeParseError`. This causes hang to heppn in nightly build, like https://travis-ci.org/PowerShell/PowerShell/jobs/217938705\r\n\r\nThis PR fix it and skip all those parser tests in nightly builds.\r\n\r\nNote that **it's OK** to skip those parser tests in nightly builds because:\r\n- Parser tests are executed in every CI builds without problem because we don't use crossgen'ed assemblies in CI builds.\r\n- We use crossgen'ed powershell assemblies in nightly builds to exercise those crossgen'ed assemblies, and running those parser tests will cause a hang to happen randomly.",
