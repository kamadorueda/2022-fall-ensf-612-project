But I am constructing a Javascript query, which **must** contain the json data.\r\nI had pester tests comparing the results to a predefined string, just to be sure, that the code is complete (As I cannot test Javascript in Pester - Or at least, I couldn't find how).\r\nthese tests were passing on Windows(5.1), but **not** on Linux (Ps6).\r\n\r\n> It is not recommended to try and perform string operations on JSON.\r\n\r\nYep, I get that too, but I had no other choice, as the ```convertto-Json``` was acting differently depending on the PS version. (As I explained above ```-Compress``` was not sufficent to fix the issue, because empty arrays would have contain an space on PS6).\r\n\r\nI am not saying this is a bug or so. Just want to make potential 'googlers' aware of how I resolved this problem. \r\n",

If you do impose stylistic changes to match some unnamed, unrelated application then allow the user the ability to continue using the old style, or specify the style they want",
