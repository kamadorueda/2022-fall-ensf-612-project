The ZIP does not seem to be signed, the properties on the zip show me that not everything is being trusted.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9250262/50057344-fa56ee00-0160-11e9-989e-c521c148e1d2.png)\r\nIf I then extract it, and execute `pwsh.exe`, I get prompts about parts of PowerShell Core not being trusted.\r\n\r\n````powershell\r\nPowerShell 6.1.1\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.

      "body": "Whilst that is true, my point was rather that PowerShell can still execute fine inside the not unblocked extracted zip because it trusts the binaries due to them being signed except for a few ps1xml files (despite them being signed as well).\r\nTo me it would be nice if everything just worked even when not being unblocked, given that 98% works already, I think that's not unreasonable.\r\nIt might be even a small bug in the execution policy of PowerShell if it trusts signed dll files but not signed p1xml files. I don't know either if one can sign zip files, I just assumed that with the hope that maybe (?) then the content would then not blocked when unzipping.",
