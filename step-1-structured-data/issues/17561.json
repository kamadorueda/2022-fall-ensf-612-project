  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWhen using Wayland on Linux, when I try and use `set-Clipboard` it completes, but when I `ctrl + v` it doesn't paste what I copied, it pastes what was in the clipboard already. If I then use `get-clipboard` it outputs what I set in `set-clipboard`. The reason I believe this is to do with Wayland, is due to the note in the [`Set-Clipboard` docs, where it says \"On Linux, this cmdlet requires the `xclip` utility to be in the path.\"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/set-clipboard?view=powershell-7#description=), but if you look at [`xclip`'s README, it says \"xclip is a command line utility that is designed to run on any system **with an X11 implementation**\" (emphasis added)](https://github.com/astrand/xclip#readme=), and Wayland is different to X11, and therefore it won't be compatible. The solution that other applications have implemented, is to use [`wl-clipboard`](https://github.com/bugaevc/wl-clipboard) when running in Wayland.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nCTRL + V: this is example text copied before setting it in PowerShell\r\nPS> Set-Clipboard \"new text\"\r\nCTRL + V: new text\r\nPS> Get-Clipboard\r\nnew text\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nCTRL + V: \"this is example text copied before setting it in PowerShell\"\r\nPS> Set-Clipboard \"new text\"\r\nCTRL + V: \"this is example text copied before setting it in PowerShell\"\r\nPS> Get-Clipboard\r\nnew text\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.5\r\nOS                             Linux 5.18.5-zen1-1-zen #1 ZEN SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu, 16 Jun 2022 20:40:47 +0000\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
