  "body": "These changes include code review feedback comments.\n\nThe changes add support for PowerShell remoting over SSH. This includes creating new transport objects to use SSH as the PSRP remoting transport along with a new parameter set for the New-PSSession, Invoke-Command, and Enter-PSSession cmdlets. The parameters are HostName, UserName, and KeyPath to allow both SSH password prompt (for interactive sessions) and key based user authentication.\n\nThis check in is to support PowerShell SSH remoting demos and the final parameter may change in the future.  There are a number of currently known issues that have been added to this repo.\n\nPowerShell SSH remoting works on Win32 full, core, Linux (Ubuntu) platforms.  It requires SSH to be installed on both client (ssh.exe) and server (sshd.exe) along with a PowerShell having these changes. \nWindows platforms require Win32-OpenSSH.\n\nDocuments on how to set up PowerShell SSH remoting on Windows and Linux platforms is forthcoming.\n",
