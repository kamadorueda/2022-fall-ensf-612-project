  "body": "The primary way I discover what commands a module provides is to run `gcm -m pester`.  I really want a way to find all the help topics available for a module.  Command help isn't so hard to find but the about topics a module exposes are harder to discover.  Plus there is a nice symmetry and transfer of learning if I could execute `man -m pester`.  \r\n\r\nBTW you can use the -Name parameter but it doesn't seem to list everything.  For example `Get-Help -Name Pester` fails to list the `about_should`, `about_Mocking`, `about_TestDrive`, `about_BeforeEach_AfterEach` help topics.",
