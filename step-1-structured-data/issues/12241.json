  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nRequiring the SeInteractiveLogonRight privilege blocks me from using DSC because my service accounts are denied this privilege, which is a good security practice.\r\n\r\nWhen trying to use my service account  I get this error:\r\n[Logon failure: the user has not been granted the requested logon type at this computer](https://github.com/dsccommunity/SqlServerDsc/issues/1416)\r\n\r\nThe scenario requires network access because the DSC resource needs to do things like validate objects in Active Directory.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\nIt would be great if this could be solved, here are some options:\r\n## Allow DSC to use a Group Managed Service Account\r\nDetails here: [Group Managed Service Accounts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/group-managed-service-accounts-overview)\r\n\r\n## Enable PsDscRunAsCredential to run without SeInteractiveLogonRight\r\nNot sure why DSC requires this privilege, but it would be nice to allow DSC to not require it.\r\n\r\n",
