When I said the intent of -Name, I mean the intent is to return the Name property of the FileInfo object.\r\nThe current implementation of FileInfo 'does' preserve the file name as it was passed in; however, since it's not documented explicitly, I avoid depending on it.\r\nAdditionally, I would expect the test to succeed with other values, such as .\\filename.txt, ./filename.txt, and /etc/filename.txt\r\nI hope that clarifies my feedback.",
