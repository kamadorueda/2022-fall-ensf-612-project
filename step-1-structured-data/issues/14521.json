  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSetting the terminal cursor position in PowerShell is easy, but results in a significant amount of duplicate code. Hence, I propose that we add a helper function to PowerShell that will reposition the cursor in two-dimensional space.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n1. The function name would be `Set-Cursor`.\r\n2. This function accepts two integer parameters, corresponding to the `[int] x, [int] y` constructor of the `[System.Management.Automation.Host.Coordinates]` class\r\n3. The function constructs an instance of the `[Coordinates]` class\r\n4. The function sets the `CursorPosition` property of the `$Host.UI.RawUI` interface to the `[Coordinates]` instance\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction Set-Cursor {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param (\r\n        [int] $x = 0,\r\n        [int] $y = 0\r\n    )\r\n    $Host.UI.RawUI.CursorPosition = [System.Management.Automation.Host.Coordinates]::new($x, $y)\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Example\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Set cursor coordinates to 5,5\r\nSet-Cursor -x 5 -y 5\r\n```",
