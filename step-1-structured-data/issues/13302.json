RTW, Preview??\r\n\r\nCan you use event viewer to take a look at the task scheduler's event logs??  Take a look at the Applications and Services Logs\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Task Scheduler\\operational log. It should show the definition, start-up and completion of the task.  I have just re-tested this - and I can see all these events. Also, if I create a task with a 'broken' task (eg I run pwsh7.exe which of course does not exist) I get error entries in the log, as expected. \r\n\r\nI suggest you remove the task, clear the logs, then re-add the task and run it immediately. Then re-look at the event log.",
