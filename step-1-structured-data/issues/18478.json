  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nAs a person who has never heard of MSH, read the documentation on PathInfo and ask the questions \"What the hell is an MSH Path? Is it an object with structure that I'm not familiar with? Is it going to have some weird specific non-standard conventions for path separators?\"\r\n\r\nSpend the next few minutes Googling (who uses Bing? LOL) \"MSH\" and \"MSH Path\" and \"MSH PowerShell\" to eventually figure out \"MSH\" is an acronym meaning Monad SHell, Monad being an ancient ancestor of PowerShell from nearly _20 YEARS AGO_\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nThe documentation makes sense to anyone who is not intimately familiar with PwoerShell's entire history.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe documentation contains acronyms which are meaningless to anyone who has not studied the rich history of PowerShell in depth, and hard to find information about online.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.19041.1682\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.19041.1682\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
