  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI love `clip`! It works on Windows, but not on Mac. Can we get an alias for `clip` to `Set-Clipboard`? I didn't even realize that `Set-Clipboard` worked until someone highlighted it in a chat room.\r\n\r\nWould be great for have an xplat alias for clip. On Mac, I had to research and find some mclip thing.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

Perhaps that can be changed to `clip` instead? My profile currently sets `clip` to `pbclip`, but it would be nice to have it universally available and set to `Set-Clipboard` instead.",
