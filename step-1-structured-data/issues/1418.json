  "body": "This disables the Slack CI notifications so we can archive the #ci channel, and disables building Linux / OS X packages for pull requests.\n\nThis should save a fair bit of time for the Travis CI builds, while still building packages for the master branch (and any feature branch).\n\n@raghushantha, @vors, do we want to do something similar for AppVeyor? I'm not so concerned about the time there, as it's already much faster than Travis CI.\n",
