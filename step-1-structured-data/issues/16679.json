  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nOn OSTree-based systems, at least most currently, packages cannot install things into `/usr/local/` as this is part of the \"user\" space and not the \"immutable\" space where it can keep track of changes properly: an issue which is outlined at coreos/rpm-ostree#233. This basically affects all `rpm-ostree` based distros, like Fedora Silverblue and Fedora IoT, as well as some other OSTree distros, such as openSUSE MicroOS.\r\n\r\nI noticed a similar issue before with the package violating the Debian Policy (#13517), and now I'm curious why PowerShell even _puts_ things in `/usr/local` **as this also violates the FHS**: `/usr/local` is for the user, while `/usr` is for packages managed by the system.\r\n\r\nThe actual part of the package the installer complains about is the man pages it looks like, as outlined below.\r\n```\r\n$ sudo rpm-ostree install powershell\r\n[...]\r\nerror: importing RPMs: Importing package 'powershell': Analyzing /usr/local/share/man/man1/pwsh.1.gz: Unsupported path; see https://github.com/projectatomic/rpm-ostree/issues/233\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_",
