For example:\r\n```powershell\r\n> $a = @{a=1;b=2;c=3;d=4}\r\n> $a|sort Name                                                                                                                                       \r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nc                              3\r\nd                              4\r\nb                              2\r\na                              1\r\n```\r\n(doesn't work)\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $a.GetEnumerator()|sort Name                                                                                                                       \r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\na                              1\r\nb                              2\r\nc                              3\r\nd                              4\r\n```\r\n(works fine)\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nMake a change so that\r\n```\r\n> $a|sort Name                                                                                                                                       \r\n```\r\nworks as expected. Current behavior benefits nobody.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
