  "body": "Resolves build failure when building for windows - the expected location of dotnet.exe is incorrect. \nManually verified by building -FullClr, -runtime ubuntu.14.04-x64 and -runtime win7-x64\n\nStart-PSBuild was expecting dotnet.exe to be located at $env:LocalAppData\\Microsoft\\dotnet\\cli.  However, my tests indicate it is located in the parent directory; $env:LocalAppData\\Microsoft\\dotnet and cli does not exist.  Confirmed by manually removing dotnet cli then running the Invoke-WebRequest/Install.ps1 steps manually.\n\nDSC doesn't see this error because we build PowerShell through our DSC build script with sets up the  environment and avoids the issue.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/971)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
