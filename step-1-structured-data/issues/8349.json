      "body": "Just tried this.  Even though when you specify `2.0` (or even just `2`), it is a version 2 catalog.  When you open the .cat file, it does show `Version=1` but that's `PublicVersion` which is always 1.  It also shows the algorithm as SHA-1, but if you inspect the individual file hashes, it shows ash SHA-256.  I see the same behavior with makecat.exe.  One small improvement we can make is a validate set for CatalogVersion since it only allows 1 or 2.  I can make this small change (PR https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/8368)",
