  "body": "I started writing a binary module for managing my instance of IdentityServer4 (from Thinktecture via Dotnet Foundation). Since I need the EntityFramework-Enabled Storage the Dependencies are rather complex, which possibly leads to mismatches of Assembly Versions and BindingRedirects come into play.\r\n\r\nPS 5.1 allowed to use the `AssemblyResolve` Event of `System.AppDomain.CurrentDomain` to bypass the problems, by just loading whatever version is available.\r\nAs far as I understood .NET Core (and thus PS Core) do not have AppDomain.\r\n\r\nIs there any story to do binding redirects in complex binary modules?",
