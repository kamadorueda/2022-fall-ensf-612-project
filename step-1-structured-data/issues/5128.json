  "body": "Some tests are culture-sensitive and hence will fail when the current culture is changed. You can get a list of culture-sensitive tests from the following failed CI test runs:\r\n\r\nAppVeypor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/PowerShell/powershell/build/6.0.0-beta.8-6020\r\nTravis CI: https://travis-ci.org/PowerShell/PowerShell/jobs/287410680\r\n\r\nThe current culture was set to 'ru-RU' in those two CI test runs, and many tests failed due to the culture change.\r\n\r\nSome tests valid only in certain culture, they should explicitly set the culture. see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/5106#issuecomment-336721783\r\nSome tests use `ToString()`, which makes them culture-dependent. Maybe the `ToString()` call is not really necessary.",
