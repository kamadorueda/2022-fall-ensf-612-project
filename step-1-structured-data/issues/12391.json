The user drive is a PSDrive that is mapped to a unique folder for each connecting user. This folder allows users to copy files to or from the system without giving them access to the full file system or exposing the FileSystem provider. The user drive contents are persistent across sessions to accommodate situations where network connectivity may be interrupted.\r\n```\r\n\r\n[its in relation with Jea perhaps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/remoting/jea/session-configurations?view=powershell-7) ?!",

Normally a JEA endpoint does not enable the file system provider so as to prevent information disclosure and unwanted file changes.
