  "body": "# PR Summary\r\nFix #11419\r\nThis addresses an issue where Windows PowerShell proxy modules have a priority over PS Core modules during WinCompat module import. (see  #11419 )\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nImplicit PS Remoting code (reused by WinCompat) is doing `Export-PSSession -AllowClobber`.\r\nThe fix is to omit `-AllowClobber` parameter if WinCompat:\r\n1) is either importing a module that is one of the [`engine modules`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/b7cb335f03fe2992d0cbd61699de9d9aafa1d7c1/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InitialSessionState.cs#L1586):\r\n```\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility\",\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.Management\",\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics\",\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.Host\",\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.Security\",\r\n\"Microsoft.WSMan.Management\",\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility\",\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management\",\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Diagnostics\",\r\n\"Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost\"\r\n```\r\n2) or is importing a module specified in `powershell.config.json` in `WindowsPowerShellCompatibilityNoClobberModuleList` list. (this list is empty by default)\r\n\r\nIf a module falls into one of these buckets, then PS-Core version of the module is imported first (for `engine modules` from `$PSHOME\\Modules`), then proxies are generated for WinPS version of the module without `-AllowClobber` flag. This result s in proxy modules not having PS Core commands.\r\n\r\nFix #11419 \r\nFix #12014 \r\n\r\nAlso fixed a bug where WinCompat module DenyList was not working for module names containing dots `.` in some cases.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [X] Issue filed: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/5724\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [X] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
