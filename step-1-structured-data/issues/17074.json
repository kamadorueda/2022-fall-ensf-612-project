  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI have created a script called f.ps1 in tcowan/powershellbug here on Github that demonstrates what I think is a PowerShell bug.  The repo is public.  \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nI expected the string operand of Write-Output to be displayed on the terminal.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe string operand to Write-Output was appended to a file my script had previously opened and the string did not appear on the terminal.  This behavior is the same under Windows 10 and Ubuntu Linux.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nPowerShell did not return an error.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nPS /home/ubuntu/tmp/3030/powershellbug> $psversiontable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Linux 5.4.0-99-generic #112-Ubuntu SMP Thu Feb \u2026\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
