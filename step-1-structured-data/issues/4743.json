  "body": "Did a regular expression search \"\\b  \\b\" in VSCode while checking if https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/4741/files missed any, so fixing the ones in .cs and .ps1 files.\r\n\r\nA few left in that help align comments making them easier to read.\r\n\r\nRemoved one commented out code that doesn't provide value.\r\n\r\nThe file SessionStateDriveAPIs.cs has a section that I didn't change, but git complained it had LF line endings and resaving as CRLF, so maybe only that section had mixed line endings.",
