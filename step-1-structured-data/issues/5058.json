  "body": "* Adds `/ResponseHeaders/` Test to WebListener\r\n* Adds `-Query` parameter to `Get-WebListenerUrl` which accepts a dictionary where keys are wuery string fields and values are query string values\r\n* Replaces http://httpbin.org/response-headers tests with WebListener\r\n\r\nReference #2504 \r\n\r\n(note: the tests as they were intended before were actually not accurate. http://httpbin.org/response-headers returns an `Content-Type: application/json` in addition to `Content-Type: ` from the supplied header. The implementation in this PR does allow for a blank/missing `Content-Type` to be returned. It is possible this may reveal errors that were not visible before.)",

Makes it easier to track when the external issue has been resolved to move forward. @SteveL-MSFT would likely create an issue for this when he came online anyway. I'm no no hurry, just trying to be helpful and thorough. ",
