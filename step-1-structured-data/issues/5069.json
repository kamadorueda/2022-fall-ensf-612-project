  "body": "Currently, if a user does not clone with the `--recursive` flag or run `git submodule update --init`, `Start-PSPester` will fail to run due to the Pester module missing. While the error hints at the Pester module not being found, there is no suggested way of fixing the issue presented to the user.  This change causes a warning to appear at the beginning of the execution of `Start-PSPester` if the Pester module cannot be found.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
