Then I start PowerShell: `pwsh`\r\n3. Then I try to use Start-Process to launch a nested shell: `Start-Process pwsh`\r\n\r\nThe last step is what begins the corruption. \r\n\r\nMy interest in using Start-Process to start pwsh was to troubleshoot someone else's code. This was as far as I got on my system. I assume the person I'm trying to help is on Windows and their error is unrelated. ",
