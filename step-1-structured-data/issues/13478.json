Many times they are not and there is a retry loop.  In this case WMF 4.0 link is not working.  Don't know if the link was pulled on purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever, this does not seem like a good test for PowerShell, as PowerShell has nothing to do whether these links work and if they don't should not cause PowerShell build to fail.  I will mark the link invocation test as 'pending'.",
