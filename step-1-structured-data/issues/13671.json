      "body": "Ah ok I didn't realise your current user was the same as the credentials you specified. It's interesting that the example without an explicit `-Credential` works just fine as that means the implicit token that Windows has stored for your current logon will work against a network logon whereas when you specify it explicitly it does not. I do not fully understand how AzureAD works but I believe Windows uses the CloudAP Negotiate provider to facilitate the logon for those accounts so that might be a place to start looking into.\r\n\r\nI'm also curious, is the connection to localhost just for an example to replicate this problem or are you actually using that for something in particular?",

I'm able to create an run a scheduled task using that same account. I'm also able to connect to over PSRemoting with the implicit and explicit credentials for my Azure AD account. I was able to do so with both the Netlogon (DOMAIN\\username) and UPN form (username@DOMAIN.COM).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/93958776-97b16e00-fd9a-11ea-9e54-dd70b15f2d2d.png)\r\n\r\nThe PSRemoting tests I tried\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8462645/93958876-d21b0b00-fd9a-11ea-9042-c1e3b42e222d.png)\r\n\r\nI also tried a HTTPS listener with a self signed certificate, even with `CbtHardeningLevel` set to `Strict` and it worked just fine.\r\n\r\nWhen looking through the Wireshark captures I found that it is using Kerberos authentication which is expected. This is a completely vanilla setup of Azure AD that I used https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance to complete.\r\n\r\nOne thing I did notice is that the PowerShell instance needs to already be running as an Administrator. Without that the underlying WinRM library is set to always fail with that error based on a [recentish update](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/windows-security-change-affecting-powershell/). Although that blog post doesn't actually describe this particular scenario, that CVE fix also affected this setup. This check is to stop a limited process from elevating itself to an Administrator without going through a UAC prompt. I can definitely rule out PowerShell adding that check by running\r\n\r\n```\r\nwinrs -r:http://localhost:5985/wsman -u:jborean93\\testazad whoami.exe\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn an elevated shell this works just fine but on a limited shell it will fail due to that new check I mentioned above.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/media/logos/logo-ms-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-domain-services/tutorial-create-instance\">Tutorial - Create an Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain</a></strong></div><div>In this tutorial, you learn how to create and configure an Azure Active Directory Domain Services managed domain using the Azure portal.</div></blockquote>",
