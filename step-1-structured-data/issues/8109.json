  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nWhile watching some demos at PSConfAsia, it's obvious that cmdlet nouns have gotten descriptive and wordy (Azure and AWS are good examples).  This `experimental` feature enables tab-completion of abbreviated cmdlets and functions:\r\n\r\n```none\r\ni-psdf<tab>\r\n\r\nreturns: Import-PowerShellDataFile\r\n\r\nu-akvmssdr<tab>\r\n\r\nreturns: Undo-AzKeyVaultManagedStorageSasDefinitionRemoval\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this only works for tab completion (interactive use), so `i-psdf` is still an invalid cmdlet name in scripts.\r\n\r\nThe matching is entirely based on the capital letters of the verb and noun.  To test this, create test.json:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"ExperimentalFeatures\": [\r\n    \"PSUseAbbreviationExpansion\"\r\n  ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd run:\r\n\r\n> pwsh -settingsfile ./test.json\r\n\r\nAssociated [RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/pull/150/files)\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [x] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
