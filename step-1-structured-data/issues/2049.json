  "body": "I realise that Powershell is not c#, and this is probably asking a lot, but:\nI think Powershell code would be less awkward to write, if it had aliases/support for the following:\n\nCan -lt also be: <\nCan -gt also be: >\nCan $true also be: true\nCan $false also be: false\nCan -eq also be: ==\nCan -ne also be: !=\nCan -le also be: <=\nCan -ge also be: >=\nCan -or also be: ||\nCan -and also be: &&\n\nPS (no pun intended): Every time I write Powershell scripts I have to think really hard to remember if -lt is LargerThan or LessThan :)\n",

      "body": "`<` and `>` are redirection operators. They already have a meaning in a shell.\n\n`true` and `false` would probable have to become yet another class of literals. Currently they aren't supported by the grammar in that way, but variables are. Furthermore, there is rarely a need for them in most scripts (except maybe for passing a boolean value to a .NET method).\n\n`||` and `&&` have different semantics than `-or` and `-and` regarding return values and what happens with output. PowerShell not having `||` and `&&` can be annoying, but I'm fairly sure it doesn't exist so far because people haven't found a viable way how to make it work in an object-based shell where program output is the result of the expression running said program, for example.\n",

But I fix it and move on.  \n\nWhat I really like about the `-<operator>` approach is that PowerShell can (and does) provide a very rich set of operators.  Many more than the set of available special characters on a typical keyboard. :-)  \n\nPlus this approach is consistent with other shells like [Bash](http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/comparison-ops.html).  Remember, PowerShell is a `shell scripting language` and not a general purpose programming language.\n",

Adding an optional secondary way to represent a subset of the operators may make reading scripts more confusing.  Agree with \"by design\".
