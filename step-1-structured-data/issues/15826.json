  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nOut-GridView is often used with -PassThru to help make a selection and continue to the next pipeline.\r\n\r\nRight now however filtering the list and making a selection is cumbersome to do with the keyboard.\r\n\r\nIt would be great if the filter text box was selected to begin with, but even while the filter text box is selected, the up, down and selection keyboard buttons are captured. \r\n\r\nThe idea here is when the grid view opens, the user should be able to type in a filter until they see what they need, use the arrow keys to select it and press enter, all without having to use the mouse or any other unnecessary keys.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nHere is an example when calling Get-ChildItem C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\ | Out-GridView -PassThru | Do-SomethingWithFiles\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2467618/126881933-6b813dd0-67f0-4ac2-9892-21f5fabbf68d.png)\r\n\r\nThe user should be able to just type \".config\", then down arrow once and press enter to select powershell.exe.config. (9 keystrokes total) The user should be able to do this without any other keystrokes or having to use the mouse.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2467618/126881965-cbef9096-4918-4750-8d9c-3f299a873b27.png)\r\n\r\n",
