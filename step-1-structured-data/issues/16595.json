  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nCould you create RPM and Debian packages for the Linux arm32 and arm64 please? This would make it much more friendly to install on a Raspberry Pi.\r\nI have been creating these manually, but it makes sense for this project to create them at the same time as the x86_64 packages.\r\nThese could then also be signed by your official key.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nWhen a new build is created and you create the x86_64 rpm and deb, please also create and sign deb and rpm for arm32 and arm64.",

Want I wanted was for you to do is make four new packages every time you make a new release just like the existing amd64 rpm and deb packages as part of your normal process.",

But you do manage to create both a Debian deb, and a RHEL rpm for the amd64 binaries. So I was hoping for something similar for arm32/arm64 to be packaged as deb and rpm for generic Linux systems using those packaging formats.",
