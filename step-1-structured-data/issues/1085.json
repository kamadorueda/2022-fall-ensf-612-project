      "body": "Ah, let me explain :smile: \n\nThe keybindings are controlled by [PSReadLine](https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine/) (more specifically, our internal port of it to Linux, that we intend to extract back to the public project as soon as we can do that). PSReadLine's default edit mode is Windows style, where Ctrl-D is unbound.\n\nI believe this is what you're seeing. Set your edit mode to Emacs (`Set-PSReadlineOption -EditMode Emacs`), and you'll have the more Bash-like experience where Ctrl-D is bound to `DeleteCharOrExit`.\n\nSo this is supported, and it's just user preference.\n",
