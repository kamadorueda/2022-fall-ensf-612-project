  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHello,\r\nIm within Visual Studio Code using Powershell.  Im following \"Using an Arduino with Python LESSON 2: Installing and Configuring Python and Visual Studio\"-Paul McWhorter on [https://youtu.be/dpQmAafRsbg](Youtube)\r\n\r\nReproducing:\r\n-added 3.9.9 Python-Instructor says after trial and error current Python doesnt work\r\n-confirmed 3.9.9\r\n-created folder using (py -3.9 -m venv ardPy)\r\n-attempted to activate using (ardPy/Scripts/activate)\r\n-ACTIVATED \"ardPy\" prior to pip serial and vpython install by running (Activate.ps1).  This creates the \"ardPy\" environment.  When i attempt to check to see if the serial and vpython are imported as in video, VSC creates a Python environment and delivers error shared.  Error shared also appears if i move the \"new file\" created to check the import of serial and vpython into \"ardPY\"\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting:\r\n-checked python in Windows 11 (win+R, powershell in text, ctrl+shft+entr, Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Undefined -Scope LocalMachine, enter) [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.2](MicrosoftDocs)\r\n-checked on Visual Studio Code-typed python (3.9.9)\r\n-refreshed/reset/reinstalled\r\n-checked for updates\r\n\r\nIm at the end of my list, perhaps someone knows whats missing or a known problem-Thanks\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nOpen a visual environment to work in and remain in that created environment.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\n& : File C:\\Users\\ccman\\OneDrive\\Desktop\\PythonFolder\\PythonArduino\\ardPy\\ \r\nScripts\\Activate.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled  \r\non this system.
