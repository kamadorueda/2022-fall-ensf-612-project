Please see Platform.NonWindowsCreateSymbolicLink in CorePsPlatform.cs, that's the method that needs to be implemented.   This is not in PowerShell itself, and so is not our job. `bin ls  s` is sufficient, just as mklink is used on Windows. When if upstream PS adds this functionality as a cmdlet, then we can do it.
