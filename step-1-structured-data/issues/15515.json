  "body": "\r\nWhen an object will output as a table, and the display area is too small to display all columns, the formatting process uses two fitting methods, it drops columns on the right and it disregards any width setting for the rightmost column (I don't know if this is reversed in right-to-left languages).  The results look like this\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/120650519-c62d3000-c475-11eb-8681-049df419a2f8.png)\r\n\r\nIn the first there is enough space for everything. In the second the mail address has wrapped  - no effort is made to try to split at punctuation marks, in the third there's isn't space for the mail column, but all the remaining columns fit, but in the last there are only two characters for mail enabled so the title is wrapped over 6 lines, and the values are displayed 2 characters at a time. \r\n\r\nIn these cases output becomes difficult to read. \r\n\r\nIt would be better if \r\n(a) Columns with a stated width were dropped if remaining space is less than their width      \r\n(b) Very narrow  columns say 6  characters or fewer are not used\r\n",
