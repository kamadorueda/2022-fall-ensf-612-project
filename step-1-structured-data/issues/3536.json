  "body": "The reason is that I would like to remove the alpha characters from the version so that this starts showing up on chocolatey public searches.  Nuget hides anything with alpha in the version number as being a pre-release.\r\n\r\nSo if you rev the second position every release will have a completely unique NUMERIC ONLY version number.\r\n\r\nWould also just be nice in general to have the numeric-only version be completely unique for easy reference.",
