  "body": "Transcription logging in PS7 is not working when hosted in C#/ASP.Net Core app.  I turned on central transcripting via the registry.  Interactive PS sessions work fine, but the hosted app running PS code does not generate any transcription logs.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTurn on transcripting in registry or group policy.\r\nSet up a .Net core 3.1 app and add PS7 SDK.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI'd expect that any PS code running on the system, even in C# hosted app, would get transcription logged.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNo logs being created for PS code running in .NetCore app\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\nPS 7.03\r\n.NetCore 3.1\r\nBlazor server app\r\nHosted in IIS on Windows 2019 Core\r\n",
