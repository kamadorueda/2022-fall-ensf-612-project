Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is\r\ncorrect and try again.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe only way to make this currently work is to _embed_ (potentially escaped) _double quotes_: `'\"./t 1.ps1\"'` or ``\"`\"./t 1.ps1`\"\"``; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process -Wait -NoNewWindow pwsh -ArgumentList '-noprofile', '-file', \"`\"./t 1.ps1`\"\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Update_: Overall, the **best workaround** is to pass a _single_ string containing _all_ arguments to `-ArgumentList` and use embedded quoting and escaping as necessary:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process -Wait -NoNewWindow pwsh -ArgumentList '-noprofile -file \"./t 1.ps1\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nEmbedded double quotes:\r\n\r\nThe embedded double quotes are unexpectedly _removed_.\r\n\r\nThe only way to make this currently work is to `\\`-escape the embedded double quotes: \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process -Wait -NoNewWindow pwsh -ArgumentList '-noprofile', '-command', '\\\"Hi!\\\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Update_: Again, the best workaround is to use a _single_ string:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process -Wait -NoNewWindow pwsh -ArgumentList '-noprofile -command \\\"Hi!\\\"'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-rc (v6.0.0-rc) on Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise  (64-bit; v6.1.7601)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.14409.1012 on Microsoft Windows 7 Enterprise  (64-bit; v6.1.7601)\r\n```\r\n",

The linked issue also points to a utility method in the CoreFx code where the kind of array-to-command-line transformation that would be needed here is used internally.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, this will break things, inevitably and in multiple scenarios, but I think if PowerShell wants to be taken seriously as a multi-platform shell, there's no way around that.\r\n\r\nWhile we may consider adding a new `-Arguments` parameter for someone who wants to pass a _single-string_, _pre-escaped_ command line (directly assignable to `ProcessStartInfo.Arguments` - which, notably, still needs to be split back into an array _before_ creating a process on _Unix_), it is `-ArgumentList` that must be fixed - which breaks things.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
