  "body": "A recent change in Win32-OpenSSH caused PowerShell SSH remoting to break when targeting a Windows machine (Windows->Windows  or  Linux->Windows).  The breaking change in Win32-OpenSSH is that when it creates a subsystem process it no longer creates a console for that process, since a console is not needed.\n\nHowever, PowerShell currently requires a process console even when it is running in server mode when a console is not really needed.\n\nThe fix is to update PowerShell so that it does not require a process console when it is running in server mode.  It includes removing unused fields in the CommandLineParameterParser class and only failing on start up with a console error when running in console mode.\n",
