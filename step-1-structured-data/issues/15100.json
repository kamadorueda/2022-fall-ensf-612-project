  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nA developer might have created some custom type that aims to behave like a primitive or built-in type, but PowerShell does not provide a way to let the developer precisely control formatting of custom types. In particular, the handling of `string` is very special --- it implements `IEnumerable<char>`, but will not be enumerated (into a stream of `char`s) when formatted. There is no way for a custom type to be handled like a `string`.\r\n\r\n**Another example.** Currently, `System.Text.Rune` does not have special handling, and the default formatting is `Format-List` instead of `ToString()`. Arguably, `ToString()` is more appropriate. For a custom type, the only way to force `ToString()` formatting is to apply `System.Management.Automation.HiddenAttribute` to all instance fields and properties. However, this comes with the downside of referencing PowerShell in the assembly containing the type, but the assembly should be usable even in an environment without PowerShell (and you don't want to load PowerShell assemblies if you aren't using it anyway).\r\n\r\nThe closest we can get for `Rune` (or any other custom type not implementing `IEnumerable` nor `IEnumerator`) is to give it a `Custom` view, but it will add blank lines when outputting. Not ideal...\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4462444/112418084-13f32280-8ce6-11eb-98ba-87299715ed00.png)\r\n\r\nThis issue aims to generate discussion on creating mechanisms to have fine-grained control over (default) formatting of a type. Related #9538.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nHere is a simple proposal.\r\n\r\n- Decouple `Out-Default` into `Format-Default` and `Out-Host`. Today's PowerShell handles `Out-Default` monolithically. It chooses `Format-Table` or `Format-List` or `ToString()`-formatting, depending on the number of non-hidden public fields and properties, and then applies `Out-Host`.\r\n- In `Format.ps1xml`, allow a new type of `NativeControl`. It specifies a **type name**, which, if found in loaded assemblies, is used to format the object.\r\n- `Format-Default` chooses the format as follows:\r\n  1. If there is a view defined for this type, use the first available view (which does not have to be `NativeControl` view). However, if `NativeControl` formatter was used to produce the object being formatted (formatting is recursive for `NativeControl` views), then `NativeControl` is skipped.\r\n  2. Otherwise, use today's default formatting choice. (Special handling for `string`; use `ToString()` if there is no non-hidden public fields or properties; use `Format-Table` if there are only a few; use `Format-List` if there are many.)\r\n\r\nMake the types in `Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Internal.Format` public, so people can create custom format objects. Provide a new abstract class:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// or another namespace?\r\nnamespace System.Management.Automation\r\n{\r\n  // The derived class must be stateless, so that\r\n  // only one instance is created per PowerShell runspace.\r\n  public abstract class NativeFormatter\r\n  {\r\n    // The returned object is recursively formatted,\r\n    // but cannot be sent to the same formatter again.\r\n    public abstract object FormatObject(object obj);\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, suppose we have a custom string class `AsciiString`, then we can create\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\npublic sealed class AsciiStringFormatter : NativeFormatter\r\n{\r\n  public override object FormatObject(object obj) { return ((AsciiString)obj).ToString(); }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will format an `AsciiString` into a `string`, which will then be handled by PowerShell natively.\r\n\r\nIt's also possible to return `IEnumerable` from `FormatObject`, which will be expanded by PowerShell, and each resulting object is formatted by their own formatter. Those expanded object could be what is `Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Internal.Format.GroupEntryData` today.\r\n\r\n**Why it is important that we implement formatting in another class.**\r\n\r\n- First, we don't want the main assembly (e.g., the assembly containing `AsciiString`) to be tied to PowerShell. By allowing it to be implemented in another class, the author can implement the formatter in a separate assembly dedicated for scripting (a kind of add-on to the main assembly).\r\n- Second, users (non-developers of the main assembly) can develop their own native formatter if they so wish.",

      "body": "We discussed this today in the Engine Working Group.\r\n\r\nI think we agree with @mklement0's above summary here that there are fundamentally a couple of different issues converging here:\r\n\r\n1. Whether IEnumerable/IEnumerable<T>-implementing types are enumerated by default is currently baked in to the core engine logic and cannot be customized.\r\n1. The formatting system also typically enumerates records on its own, historically so that it can display the contents of a dictionary (etc).\r\n\r\nFor preventing enumeration of additional types, we think allowing some method of annotating a type so that it's not enumerated in the pipeline may be of interest. We all agreed that we'd need to see some more concrete real-world examples of where the current behaviour is insufficient and how adding this kind of feature would improve things. Whether this should take the form of an attribute, or a cached list of types which can be updated via an Add/Remove method, or some other form, we're not entirely sure.\r\n\r\n@rjmholt noted that he's raised a similar suggestion in the past, and it was at that point rejected, but we agree that it may still be worth considering. Given that this logic operates in `LanguagePrimitives` there may be performance concerns associated with modifying the logic, so we'd prefer to see some more real-world examples of how this is impacting users before we commit to adding functionality here.\r\n\r\nFor the formatting enumeration issue itself, the performance impact is less stringent, so I think perhaps implementing an attribute to disable enumeration when an object hits the formatter might be considered, but we'd need need to see a prototype or at least a suggested API surface before we can make a clear call on that side of things.\r\n\r\nI think at this point it might make sense to split this issue into two more focused issues?",
