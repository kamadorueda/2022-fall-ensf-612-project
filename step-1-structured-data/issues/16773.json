  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\n`Get-Content` (without `-Raw` or `-AsByteStream`) breaks a file into \"lines\" of `-Encoding` characters which are then sent into the pipeline as individual strings. Set-Content receives strings from the pipeline (or converts the received objects to strings) and saves them as \"lines\" by appending a new-line marker to each string.\r\n\r\n`Get-Content` allows the entire file to be treated as a single string using `-Raw` which ignores new-line markers (as line breaks, just passed literally). This string can then be manipulated with any new-line markers intact (allowing programmatic control of the treatment of `\\n` vs `\\r\\n`, for example) but when saved to a new file using `Set-Content`, the \"entire file as single string\" then has a new-line marker appended.\r\n\r\nI suggest that `Set-Content` should also have a `-Raw` parameter to permit total control of the saved contents. Whether a new-line marker should be placed **between** received strings is a matter for debate but I would suggest not as they can be easily added externally, if desired.\r\n\r\nWhile this behaviour could also be achieved by converting the string to a byte stream (using `[System.Text.Encoding]::(desired encoding value).GetBytes()`) and then specifying `-AsByteStream`, this would be\r\n1. cumbersome\r\n2. performance degrading\r\n\r\nThough I have only tested this on 5.1.18362.145, there is no mention of `-Raw` in the documentation through to 7.3. (Not a breaking change since no valid script would currently have this parameter.)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n`Set-Content -Raw` would concatenate the received strings (or stringified objects) and write this to the file verbatim without any added new-lines.",
