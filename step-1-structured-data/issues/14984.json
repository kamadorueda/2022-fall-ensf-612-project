  "body": "When I run a command with `-WhatIf` switch within a `Foreach-Object` loop, it shows the \"What if: ...\" output.\r\nWhen doing the same with `-Parallel`, this output is not shown.\r\n\r\nIf there is `Write-Host` statement in loop body, it is visible in both cases.\r\n\r\nIs there anything I can do about it? Is it a bug, or by design?\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nPrepare some directories:\r\n```powershell\r\n(\"test1\", \"test2\", \"test3\") | ForEach-Object { New-Item -Path .\\$_ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen remove them with -WhatIf switch using -Parallel\r\n```powershell\r\n(\"test1\", \"test2\", \"test3\") | ForEach-Object -Parallel { Remove-Item -Path .\\$_ -WhatIf }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nShould be the same as running:\r\n```powershell\r\n(\"test1\", \"test2\", \"test3\") | ForEach-Object { Remove-Item -Path .\\$_ -WhatIf }\r\n```\r\n\r\n```none\r\nWhat if: Performing the operation \"Remove File\" on target \"<current dir>\\test1\".\r\nWhat if: Performing the operation \"Remove File\" on target \"<current dir>\\test2\".\r\nWhat if: Performing the operation \"Remove File\" on target \"<current dir>\\test3\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n<No ouput>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\u276f $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

This way I don't have to test for the switch value and run different commands.\r\nBut it is not a deal breaker :)",

It appears that `-whatif` writes directly to the host and is not redirectable.\r\n\r\nI'll let @PaulHigin  speak for what this means for `foreach-object -parallel` but I don't think it is good.",
