  "body": "When user is trying some online tutorial they found, they may encounter a cmdlet they don't have on their system.  We should use the suggestion system to query psgallery if that cmdlet exists in a module and suggest they install it.  Similar experience to Linux and apt when you type 'git' and Git isn't installed yet.\r\n\r\nRequires changes in PSGallery to make this performant as we don't want to block the console too long waiting for a response from the internet.",
