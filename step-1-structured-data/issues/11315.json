I tried to use Move-Item and then Rename-Item to fix the name of the file but was unable to due so. As can be see in the log even Get-ChildItem struggled with displaying the file appropriately. gci mistakenly thought the file was in a subfolder. Using mv from bash I was able to fix the file name. I would never intentionally create a file with such a name but It should still be possible to fix the name when it does happen.\r\n```powershell\r\nengineer@se206:~/Downloads/5603/windows/factory/bu$ pwsh-preview \r\nPowerShell 7.0.0-preview.6\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.
