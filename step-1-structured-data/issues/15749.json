  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently the compiler uses reflection to construct a generic instantiation of `PSVariableAssignmentBinder.CopyInstanceMembersOfValueType<T>`.  This method then unboxes with an explicit cast and then boxes that value.\r\n\r\nThe compiler could instead use `RuntimeHelpers.GetObjectValue` which is a method provided by the BCL specifically to enable dynamic languages to explicitly copy a boxed value type.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that it's slower though.  If that's the case a comment explaining why that method isn't used may be warranted.\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nChange [this code](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c49cf068b35bf71b0585efaa286df9f49b557805/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs#L1968-L1973) to something like the following:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\n--- a/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs\r\n+++ b/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Binding/Binders.cs\r\n@@ -1968,1973 +1968,1972 @@\r\n             if (s_mutableValueTypesWithInstanceMembers.ContainsKey(type))\r\n             {\r\n-                var genericMethodInfo = CachedReflectionInfo.PSVariableAssignmentBinder_CopyInstanceMembersOfValueType.MakeGenericMethod(new Type[] { type });\r\n-                expr = Expression.Call(genericMethodInfo, convertedExpr, originalExpr);\r\n+                expr = Expression.Call(CachedReflectionInfo.RuntimeHelpers_GetObjectValue, originalExpr)\r\n                 needVersionCheck = false;\r\n             }\r\n```",
