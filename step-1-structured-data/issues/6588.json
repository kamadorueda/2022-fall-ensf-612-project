  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nAttempted install of deb package for ubuntu 17 on Ubuntu 18.04\r\noutput of `lsb_release -a`:\r\n```\r\nNo LSB modules are available.\r\nDistributor ID:\tUbuntu\r\nDescription:\tUbuntu Bionic Beaver (development branch)\r\nRelease:\t18.04\r\nCodename:\tbionic\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot sure what I expected, but Powershell seems to rely on `libcurl3`. Ubuntu 18.04 uses `libcurl4`, which seems to conflict with libcurl3. This makes it impossible to have Powershell and the bundled version of curl etc installed at the same time.\r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if a deb package compatible with Ubuntu 18 was released.\r\n",
