Unfortunately there's no supported way to uninstall a .pkg (that I could find).  You can manually delete the beta.8 folder along with the /usr/bin/powershell symlink.",

There is also a PowerShell icon in `Applications` folder in Finder that opens PowerShell as well.",

I've missed that in the past!\r\n\r\nI must admit I am guilty of not seeking out the change log - now that I've seen it, it might be good to include the rename of powershell to pwsh as a breaking change?\r\n\r\n@thezim I also appreciate the remove instructions, with 9 betas to date, there is likely to be something there I no longer need!",
