  "body": "@lzybkr bkr added a [gist](https://gist.github.com/lzybkr/dcb973dccd54900b67783c48083c28f7) adding coloring formatdata for MatchInfo. \r\n\r\nI played a bit with it and added coloring of [regex groups](https://gist.github.com/powercode/4833804efd23045387bd5d5249d76f7b) and after having used it for a few months, I have to say that it is very useful. Instead of a wall of text, it is really easy to distinguish the things you're looking for.\r\n\r\n![matchinfo](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3505151/21308912/54c8894c-c5dc-11e6-9a21-df68f0cbfa2c.PNG)\r\n\r\nHow about making some version of this ship with the platform?\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Most won't notice, but there is a small issue that we should consider in the formatting engine before using color in any default formatting.\r\n\r\nIf you change your foreground/background colors, the \"reset color\" ANSI escape sequence (CSI 0 m) doesn't work as expected.  For example, I have the following in my profile (using my unpublished module [ConsoleUtilities](https://github.com/lzybkr/ConsoleUtilities))\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module -Name ConsoleUtilities\r\n\r\nSet-ConsoleColorTable -ColorTable @{\r\n    Black       = '#141414'\r\n    Blue        = '#004bff'\r\n    Cyan        = '#00ffff'\r\n    DarkBlue    = '#374b80'\r\n    DarkCyan    = '#008080'\r\n    DarkGray    = '#808080'\r\n    DarkGreen   = '#008000'\r\n    DarkMagenta = '#800080'\r\n    DarkRed     = '#C81010'\r\n    DarkYellow  = '#808000'\r\n    Gray        = '#c0c0c0'\r\n    Green       = '#00ff00'\r\n    Magenta     = '#ff00ff'\r\n    Red         = '#ff0000'\r\n    White       = '#ffffff'\r\n    Yellow      = '#ffff00'\r\n} -TextForegroundColor Gray -TextBackgroundColor Black\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I start PowerShell from the regular shortcut that has the royal blue background, my suggested implementation for highlighting matches causes weird things to happen.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this issue should be considered a PowerShell bug or conhost bug, but I do think PowerShell needs to provide a good experience for folks that customize their consoles like I do.",
