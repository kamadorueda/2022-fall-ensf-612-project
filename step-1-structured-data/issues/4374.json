  "body": "EDIT by @joeyaiello: this is for PowerShell Standard 5.1 now. We need to make the definition *and* publish it.\r\n\r\nIntent is to enable module authors to target this library to build portable modules that work across different versions of Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core.  Tests would need to validate against Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PSCore6 Windows/Linux/Mac.",

It doesn't work against PS.L v3 because the module uses debugger properties that were added after v3.  Also been trying to get PSES to compile as netstandard2.0 on Linux and I run into a missing property (SupportsVirtualTerminal) on the PSHostUserInterface interface.\r\n\r\nBTW should the current library be renamed `PowerShellStandard.3.Library` and the new one be called `PowerShellStandard.5.1.Library`?  Kind of like you've done with the ref assemblies. It's a little weird using the version of the package to indicate the version of PowerShell it targets.  Just sayin'.  :-)",
