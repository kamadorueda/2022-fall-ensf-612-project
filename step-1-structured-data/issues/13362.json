      "body": "@sdwheeler This PR #13353 has tests to verify if the help system is properly identifying if a cmdlet has this attribute or not. To verify I had added the attribute to the correct parameters I used a PS script to gather the globbing value from the help system. If external help is present it uses what you put in the maml. I compared the output to your list and caught a couple of extra parameters. As for ensuring that the attribute is added on new parameters and cmdlets I'm not sure about the best way to do that.\r\n\r\n@vexx32 had an idea to remove the need to have this attribute at all in #4715. If it was the pre-1.0 days to have parameters use `WildcardPattern` as the parameter type. As a related suggestion we could have a generic type of `[Wildcard<T>]` so the module author can indicate at the type level if wildcards are supported. The generic type could have properties/methods that wrap or use `WildcardPattern` to validate `IsMatch()`. There are a couple of examples in the PS code where the input type of a wildcard parameter is not a string. Those cases use an argument transform attribute.",

The list was built based on the existing documentation. If the documentation is not accurate then neither is the list. We need someone to verify how the parameters actually work and add the attribute where appropriate. The list was an attempt at limiting the scope of the effort instead of having to review every parameter of every cmdlet.",
