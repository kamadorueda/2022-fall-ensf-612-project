  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThis is really just a continuation of the issue #3020, as it didn't really provide a satisfactory answer. As far as I can understand it, the #9614 PR doesn't really offer a solution for this scenario. I'd like to the ability to take the following line:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Ports | ForEach-Object -Process { NETSTAT.EXE -ano | findstr.exe :8080 | ForEach-Object -Process { ($_ -split '\\s+')[-1] } | Sort-Object | Get-Unique | ForEach-Object -Process { taskkill.exe /F /PID $_ } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nand convert it to:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Ports |\r\n    ForEach-Object -Process {\r\n        NETSTAT.EXE -ano |\r\n            findstr.exe :8080 |\r\n            ForEach-Object -Process {\r\n                ($_ -split '\\s+')[-1]\r\n            } | Sort-Object |\r\n            Get-Unique |\r\n            ForEach-Object -Process {\r\n                taskkill.exe /F /PID $_\r\n            }\r\n    }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this would go a long way in approving readability. At the very least, with the \r\n\r\n```json\r\n\"powershell.codeFormatting.pipelineIndentationStyle\": \"IncreaseIndentationForFirstPipeline\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nsetting enabled, when I manually add the new line after each `|` and `}`, it will format the indentation correctly which is nice.\r\n",
