      "body": "This is already fixed via https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/11194\r\n\r\nThis happens because when using a PSJob cmdlet, PowerShell will try to import modules that implement the JobAdapter.  With the new WinPS code path, it imports ScheduledJob module since it implements JobAdapter.  It does this because ScheduledJob (along with PSWorkFlow) support serialized jobs.  This means that when you do `Get-Job`, it will find and show these jobs.  But to be able to do that, it has to load those modules and get them to enumerate their jobs.  Since ScheduledJob doesn't actually work with PowerShell 7 and PSWorkFlow is already not supported, the fix is to not automatically load these two modules.",

But it happens rarely and I haven't stopped what I've been doing to investigate, so I don't have any kind of pattern of \"x will auto-load if I do Y\". It sounds like Steve has explained what causes this module to load and there is already a fix in the works :-) \r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT  so  it still tries to load modules which implement the jobadapter but has a hard coded exception for one or two ?   \r\n\r\n",
