  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n#10908 introduces a new parameter to the `Read-Host` called `MakedInput` which makes the cmdlet return a string and it does not echo the input to the string ( see discussion in #10847). This parameter was only implemented for the `InternalHostUserInterface` and not for the `RemoteHostUserInterface`.\r\n\r\n**Note that**: implementing this requires extra investigation as it make create compatibility issues with Windows Powershell.\r\n\r\n>Support for remoting would involve adding new host callbacks and this would modify the existing remoting protocol and may have implications for Windows PowerShell. For now I think throwing this unsupported exception is fine. But please create a new Issue for this (Remoting support for new ReadLineMaskedAsString host method).\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nN/A\r\n",
