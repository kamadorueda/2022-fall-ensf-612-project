I didnt really find anything related to this on google. The Docs for the PowershellSDK are not mentioning this aswell or I couldn't find it. Currently the plan is to remoteconnect (with Enter-PSSession) to the PC running my application and from there use Enter-PSHostProcess.\r\nThank you",

Since Powershell already has remotecapabilities I would like to use these for a remote console. The problem is I need to connect to the process of my Programm to get the ability to communicate with the already running programm per static function calls. So I've searched a lot and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39376165/getting-enter-pshostprocess-behavior-via-pssessionconfiguration-file) they mention a double-Hop to connect to the process remotly. The problem is I cant even connect to my programm running powershell with Enter-PSHostProcess because I get the Error above.",
