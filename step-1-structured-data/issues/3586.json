  "body": "I am an intermediate-noob at bash so I would love to have some testing of the new installer before doing a pull request.\r\n\r\nThe goals and overall idea is described in #3547 \r\n\r\n## Features (and fixes of download.sh):\r\n* Bare minimum requirements to get going (wget & sed) (attempts to install curl if not present)\r\n* defaults to only install PowerShell core (using repos where they are available)\r\n* For non-repo based installs - detects latest version from git tags\r\n* Optional -includeide switch installs VS Code and PowerShell Extension (using repos where they are available)\r\n* Fix/Cleanup: Installs on OpenSUSE using download from regular github releases page (until repo is established)\r\n* Removed restriction to OpenSUSE 42.1, should install 42.1 and later.\r\n* Removed restriction to CentOS only - should install on Redhat as well.\r\n\r\n## I have it working and tested under:\r\n* Ubuntu Desktop 16.04\r\n* CentOS 7.2 with GNOME Desktop\r\n* OpenSUSE 42.2 with KDE Desktop\r\n\r\n## Known Issues (and Help Needed):\r\n* The -appimage switch just calls the pre-existing appimage.sh which did not work on any of the above test cases\r\n* The OSX install was pieced together from various sources and is untested.\r\n\r\nHere is the readme: https://github.com/DarwinJS/PowerShell/blob/feature/install-powershell.sh/tools/install-powershell.readme.md\r\n\r\n## Here are the commands to kick off the install (also covered in readme):\r\n\r\n### Only Install PowerShell Core:\r\n```bash\r\nbash <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarwinJS/PowerShell/feature/install-powershell.sh/tools/install-powershell.sh)\r\n```\r\n###  Install PowerShell Core with IDE:\r\n```bash\r\nbash <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarwinJS/PowerShell/feature/install-powershell.sh/tools/install-powershell.sh) -includeide\r\n```\r\n###  Install PowerShell Core with IDE and do tests that require a human to interact with the install process:\r\n```bash\r\nbash <(wget -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DarwinJS/PowerShell/feature/install-powershell.sh/tools/install-powershell.sh) -includeide -interactivetesting\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If and only if you give the -includeide switch, the script installs vs code and powershell vs code extension so you can edit and debug powershell on the linux machine similar to how you do in PowerShell ISE on a Windows machine.",
