  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1.  Create a WinRM remoting endpoint with 'RestrictedRemoteServer' session type.\r\nConfig.pssc file:\r\n```powershell\r\n@{\r\n    SchemaVersion = '1.0.0.0'\r\n    GUID = '324095c8-629a-489f-8c69-50595007c937'\r\n    Author = 'contoso'\r\n    CompanyName = 'Contoso'\r\n    Copyright = '(c) Contoso. All rights reserved.'\r\n    Description = 'Test Role'\r\n    **SessionType = 'RestrictedRemoteServer'**\r\n    TranscriptDirectory = 'E:\\temp\\Transcripts'\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2.  Attempt to connect to the WinRM endpoint.\r\n\r\nA parser error is returned to the client because the 'RestrictedRemoteServer' creates proxy commands, and the proxy commands include the new 'clean' block, even though the server session does not enable 'clean block' experimental feature.  Fix is to not include clean blocks in proxy commands if the experimental feature is not enabled.\r\n\r\nHere is where the proxy commands are created:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/5e37308e1b4dbfff2eb89a21c38d401def40cb26/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InitialSessionState.cs#L1430\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nSuccessful connection to endpoint.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nA remoting error is returned:\r\n\r\nNew-PSSession: [localhost] Processing data from remote server localhost failed with the following error message: At line:63 char:1\r\n+ clean\r\n+ ~~~~~\r\nunexpected token 'clean', expected 'begin', 'process', 'end', 'clean', or 'dynamicparam'. For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.3.0-preview.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.3.0-preview.3-27-g5e37308e1b4dbfff2eb89a21c38d401def40cb26\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
