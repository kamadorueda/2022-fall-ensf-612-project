  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nWhen setting Powershell as the default user shell in a unix system using `chsh` it is not allowed to pass any arguments to the shell. Thus, a Unix user which wants Powershell to be its default shell cannot avoid the logo.\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nMaybe have Powershell load an additional file before `$profile`. The file could contain settings such as the ability to disable the logo\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",

Usually, users define environment variables in files such as `~/.profile` which are eventually read by the user shell. There are other ways such as `~/.pam_environment` or `~/.config/environment.d/*.conf` when using systemd, but I don't know if there's a way to do that in macOS.",
