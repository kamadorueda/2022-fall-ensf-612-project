  "body": "Note: This bug affects Windows PowerShell too.\r\n\r\nIf columns with custom column widths are specified - which due to a related bug currently only takes effect if the _first_ column has one; see #14676 - the remaining columns without a custom-width specifications are unexpectedly auto-assigned a width based on _evenly dividing the remaining line length_ rather than on the width of the values (received within the first 300 msecs.), as usual.\r\n\r\nNote: While this could be conceived of as a _feature_, it certainly shouldn't be the _default_ behavior and would require _opt-in_ via a switch yet to be introduced.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$obj = [pscustomobject]@{ a='12345'; b='B'; c='C' }\r\n\r\n# Get the formatting with the default column widths\r\n$a = $obj | Format-Table -Property a, b, c | Out-String\r\n\r\n# Get the formatting with the first column explicitly set to its actual width, which should result in the same formatting.\r\n# !! However, this causes the remaining columns to each be set to half the width of the remaining line.\r\n$b = $obj | Format-Table -Property @{ e='a'; width=5 }, b, c | Out-String\r\n\r\n$a | Should -Be $b\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails due the behavior described above; print `$a, $b` to see the difference.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected strings to be the same, but they were different. Expected length: 350 Actual length:   32 Strings differ at index 9. Expected: '...   b      ...' But was:  '\\na     b c\\n-     - -\\n12345 B\r\n     | C\\n\\n'\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith a (simulated) console-window width of `50` (via `Out-String -Width 50`), printing `$a, $b` yields:\r\n\r\n```none\r\na     b c\r\n-     - -\r\n12345 B C\r\n\r\na     b                      c\r\n-     -                      -\r\n12345 B                      C\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that specifying `-AutoSize` avoids the problem.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.2\r\n```\r\n",
