      "body": "This is an interesting bug.  It is not an error in PowerShell remoting or the serialization layer, or even in PowerShell.  The bug looks to be in the CLR.  This hang only occurs on Linux when enumerating named pipe files (e.g., /tmp/clr-debug-pipe-12555-7925167-in).  \r\n\r\nWhen enumerating files in a directory PowerShell returns System.IO.FileSystemInfo objects.  These objects include custom members, and one (VersionInfo) that returns a System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo object via a PowerShell script.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[System.Diagnostics.FileVersionInfo]::GetVersionInfo('/tmp/clr-debug-pipe-12555-7925167-in')\r\n```\r\nThis causes the process to hang and happens whenever the static method is called with a named pipe file path.  No exception is thrown, just the process/thread hangs.\r\n\r\nThe reason this hangs PowerShell remoting is that when the FileInfo object is serialized the VersionInfo custom property needs to be evaluated by running the above script.  The hang also occurs if you try to serialize a FileInfo object corresponding to a named pipe file.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ndir /tmp/clr-debug-pipe-12555-7925167-in | Export-CliXml -Path $home/FI.xml\r\n````\r\nOne workaround is to return strings instead of de-serialized objects\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-Command -Session $s -Script { Get-ChildItem /tmp | Out-String }\r\n```\r\n\r\nSince this is a very specific case I feel it is not a beta-1 bug and am moving it to beta-2 time frame.\r\n\r\nThis will need to be investigated by the CLR team since it does not appear to be related to PowerShell.",
