  "body": "Someone mentioned something curious about [`ForEach-Object`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/759c4abde811aff1490dec92e438d61e341c3181/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InternalCommands.cs#L63) and I went to take a look at it.\r\n\r\nWhat the heck is going on in there? Do we really have known and supported script patterns like this?\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$val | ForEach-Object { <# begin #> } { <# process 1 #> } { <# process 2 #> } { <# process 3 #> } { <# end #> }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there some history here that influences this? Do we really need to tax the parameter binder trying to bind *n* script blocks? \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/759c4abde811aff1490dec92e438d61e341c3181/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InternalCommands.cs#L103-L120\r\n\r\nDo we really need `-RemainingScripts`? I'd really love to hear if there's a rationale behind it I'm missing; I can't really see a whole lot of reasons to allow this kind of input myself.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/759c4abde811aff1490dec92e438d61e341c3181/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InternalCommands.cs#L145-L160\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nI don't know _all that much_ about the parameter binder, but it seems to me like this would be _significantly_ more effective with a small handful of parameter sets, and 3 script block inputs, maximum.\r\n\r\n`ForEach-Object` is considered **really** slow by many advanced users, and I can't help but think that this is a fairly large part of it.\r\n\r\nCan we simplify this parameter binding by adding a couple of sets? (Don't think there's a whole lot of utility allowing `-Process`-less? Let me know if I'm mistaken!)\r\n\r\n- ~~`BeginOnly`~~ \r\n- `BeginAndEnd`\r\n- `ProcessOnly` (Default in the case of a single script block.)\r\n- `BeginAndProcess`\r\n- `ProcessAndEnd` (Default in the case of by-position entry for two blocks.)\r\n- `EndOnly`\r\n- `AllBlocks`\r\n\r\n\\* combinations that include `-End` without `-Process` might be able to utilise `$input`? I'm not sure if that's hooked up, or if it could be.\r\n\r\n### Subtractions\r\n\r\nThis would remove the ability to provide more than 3 script blocks to the command, a capability that I've personally never seen and didn't know about. I've also never heard anyone even really mention it was _possible_ until recently. \r\n\r\nI don't think this is a huge negative, really; anything you can do with the current behaviour, you can do in only 3 scriptblocks anyway.\r\n\r\n### Additions\r\n\r\nHopefully a good deal of speedup?\r\n\r\n(And yes, I'm more than happy to sift through this myself and submit a PR, I just want to know if there's context I need to take into account / am missing, before I spend a good couple hours rewriting this.)",

      "body": "But the point of `ForEach-Object` is syntax and flexibility, not speed.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't really _do_ anything, except invoke code with pipeline inputs, so while you're obviously right that you can do _almost_ all of the things it can do with less parameters (or even without a cmdlet at all, using the call `&` or dot `.` operator) ... the syntax for that is extremely nasty. You might want to mug someone with it...\r\n\r\nHere's a trivial example you cannot do with a `ForEach-Object` that only takes three blocks:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$userProvidedScript = { if($_ -eq 5) { Write-Error \"TWO\" -ea silentlycontinue } }\r\n$validationScript = { if (!$?) { Write-Host \"The user provided script did not work with ${_}\" } }\r\n\r\n1..10 | ForEach-Object $null,\r\n$UserProvidedScript, \r\n$validationScript, \r\n$null\r\n```\r\n\r\nAutomatic variables are (re)set between each scriptblock, so `$PSItem` and the other automatic variables like `$?` are (re)set, but otherwise, all the blocks share scope. You can set variables in one, read them in another, and always trust that `$_` or `$input` or `$PSItem` will be what came in from the pipeline...\r\n\r\nAnyway. My point is: you're talking about breaking backward compatibility (of a feature which granted, may be rarely used) on the hypothetical that you can make it faster. \r\n\r\nEven if you were saying that you've made it 2x faster, and this is the down-side, I think I'd still be saying: maybe that should be a new command - it's not worth breaking this one (which has been like this for 12 years) to make it _slightly_ faster, when there are so many ways to write things that are **much, much faster**.\r\n\r\nHow about, instead, we make the (exponentially faster, and less complex) `&` call operator and the dot-source operator take three scriptblocks instead of just one as an alternative syntax (i.e. `& {} {} {}` could be the same as ` &{ begin{} process{} end{} }`)\r\n\r\nHeck, how about we just make `&` be a `filter` instead of a `function`, where the default block is the `process` block.
