  "body": "I found that tab expansion doesn't work in a symlinked folder. Investigation found that the shell can't see ANY items in the $PWD, but /something/ causes things to right themselves in the same session.\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n``` powershell\ncd /tmp\nmkdir test1\nmkdir test1/foo\nmkdir test1/bar\nln -s test1 test2 # using /bin/ln here\ndir test1 # \"case A\"\ndir test2 # \"case B\"\n```\n## Expected behavior\n\nOutput from case A should equal case B, but the \"Directory name\" should read  \"/tmp/test2\".\n## Actual behavior\n\nCase B shows only the file entry of the symlink. That would be ok in some cases, HOWEVER what you see is that this behavior affects lots of things like tab expansion. For example, to continue repro:\n\n``` powershell\ncd test2\ncd [TAB] # nothing happens with any tab completion commands here\n```\n\nNote that you can get around some of the issues by manually appending a forward-slash. e.g. `dir test2/`.\n## Environment data\n\nOSX 10.11.6\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\nName                           Value                                                                                     \n----                           -----                                                                                     \nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha                                                                               \nPSEdition                      Core                                                                                      \nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                   \nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0                                                                                   \nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.8                                                                            \nCLRVersion                                                                                                               \nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                       \nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                       \nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1         \n```\n",
