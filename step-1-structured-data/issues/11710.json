If you use nonstandard verbs, _PSSA will haunt you_, as @JohnLeyva has stated.\r\n\r\nI definitely agree that it's personal preference whether you'd like to *extend* the compliance guidline to include non-public commands. As for PSSA, yeah it's unfortunate that PSSA can't determine if a command is exported.  Personally I use `VerbNoun` naming in non-public commands mostly so it's easy to tell at a glance what is public and what isn't; not setting off PSSA is a plus as well.\r\n\r\n> (There's also the issue of something that may start out internal becoming public later; if you start out with compliant names, no refactoring is needed.)\r\n\r\nI get what you're saying but no refactoring seems unlikely.  I don't think the majority of folks build out an internal function in the same way they would a public one.  Plus in this scenario, this internal function is internal because you're just wrapping existing `Test` and `Set` commands to keep DRY.\r\n\r\n> There is currently no good solution:\r\n> \r\n> * You can either live with the annoyance of PSSA warnings that you know don't apply.\r\n> * Or you can turn PSSA verb warnings off altogether, and lose warnings you may care about.\r\n\r\nOr use a different naming scheme for non-public commands.  The list of approved verbs is pretty tailored to public API's imo.  I don't think it makes sense to try to shoe horn incredibly specific and narrow functions into the same naming conventions as general use API's, and I don't think it makes sense to expand the pool of verbs approved for public API's to include every verb you might want for internal commands.\r\n\r\n> (I suppose making the [`UseApprovedVerbs`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSScriptAnalyzer/blob/master/RuleDocumentation/UseApprovedVerbs.md) configurable with exclusion lists would _technically_ be a solution, but I don't think encouraging \"private sub-languages\" is a good idea\r\n\r\nDefinitely agree there.
