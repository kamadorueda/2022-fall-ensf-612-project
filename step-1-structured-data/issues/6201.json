Overall complexity will remain O(1)+O(1). Maybe this kind of approach: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1971052. If it is going to run only on .NET Core 2.1+, then we have even performant APIs like System.IO.Pipeline, Span<T>, Memory<T>, System.Runtime.Intrincis to squeeze the last bit of performance.

There's probably no need to support CR-only newlines on _output_.\r\n\r\n* In addition to either `-Path` or `-LiteralPath`, at least _one_ of `-Lf`, `-CrLf`, and `-ToEncoding` must be passed.\r\n\r\n* In the absence of `-FromEncoding`, the usual rules apply: detect the standard Unicode BOMs; default to UTF-8 in their absence.\r\n\r\n* In the absence of `-ToEncoding`, default to whatever the effective _input_ encoding was (whether inferred from the existing content  or explicitly specified with `-FromEncoding`).\r\n\r\n* (Conceptual) in-place updating of the input files is performed by default, EXCEPT\r\n\r\n  * if `-AsByteStream` is specified, in which case the input files are left untouched and a _byte array_ is passed out, which can be saved to a different file - albeit only a _single_ one - using `Set-Content -AsByteArray`. Passing the bytes one by one will not perform well, though.  \r\nNote that there's currently no way to send a raw byte stream to external programs.   \r\n\r\nNote that decoding and encoding will hamper performance, though conceivably you could optimize the cases where no transcoding is needed and switch to byte(-tuple) processing there.",
