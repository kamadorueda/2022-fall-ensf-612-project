  "body": "I'm writing a function where I want to output paths, but I want to provide a `Relative` switch to give the user the option to see the relative path of the file instead of the full path (because paths are long, and there's a lot of other data).\r\n\r\nI need to use `Convert-Path` to produce \"normal\" looking file system paths, but I want them to be relative.  \r\n\r\n### I can't use Resolve-Path because:\r\n\r\na) It changes it's output *Type* based on the `-Relative` switch (this is just silly, but it breaks everything because ...)\r\nb) When it's not -Relative, it changes it's output based on the input:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\nI \u2665 PS> Resolve-Path C:\\Windows | % ToString\r\nC:\\Windows\r\n\r\nI \u2665 PS> Resolve-Path FileSystem::C:\\Windows | % ToString\r\nFileSystem::C:\\Windows\r\n\r\nI \u2665 PS> Resolve-Path Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::C:\\Windows | % ToString\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Core\\FileSystem::C:\\Windows\r\n\r\nI \u2665 PS> Resolve-Path Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\FILESYSTEM::\\WINDOWS | % ToString\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Core\\FILESYSTEM::\\WINDOWS\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I want the paths relative to the common source root (e.g. for the Coverage report in Pester). \r\n\r\nTo get a relative path, I need to use `Resolve-Path` instead of `Convert-Path` and if I'm *not* using the relative path, I need to use Convert-Path to avoid having the long FileSystem provider name in the output?\r\n\r\nI am currently doing this:\r\n\r\n```posh\r\n        ${function:Resolve} = if($Relative) {\r\n            { process { $_ | Resolve-Path -Relative } }\r\n        } else {\r\n            { process { $_ | Convert-Path } }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n",
