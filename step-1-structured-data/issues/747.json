      "body": "On Linux, if you a symlink to a directory, and you type GetChildItem on that symbolic link, you will not get anything in return.\n\nThis is caused by CoreFx treating symlinks to directories as directories.  And when it tries to enumerate the \"directory\", it finds no child item, and therefore returns nothing.\n\nThe fix is to treat this special case kind of like a file instead of directory, and just write the DirectoryInfo to output stream.\n",
