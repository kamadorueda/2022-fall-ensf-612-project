  "body": "Currently, the installer errors out if pre-req checks fail.  At best it provides a URL to documentation on pre-reqs (but the URL isn't clickable).  We should leverage Bootstrapper to bundle pre-reqs.  As long as URLs to pre-reqs are stable, we can have WiX auto-download and install the pre-reqs.  For users who don't want to install some pre-reqs because they don't plan to use certain capabilities (like WMF4 for WSMan support), they should use the .zip pkg instead.",
