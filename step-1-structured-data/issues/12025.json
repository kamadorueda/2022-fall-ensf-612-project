  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\nInstall PowerShell 7 Release following defaults on a system where PowerShell 6 is present\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n6 can remain in place for side by side testing OR be removed  depending on what the user requires\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n6 is removed, and attempting to [re]install  6.2.4 gives an error \"there is a newer version installed\". \r\n\r\nSuggestions. \r\n1.  Install should ask before removing a prior version (perhaps only there is a change of major version)\r\n2. Install should not refuse to install an older version (again perhaps only allowing a change of major version). \r\n\r\n# Work round (for windows 10)\r\nInstall makes a shadow copy. \r\n`get-ciminstance Win32_ShadowCopy | ft installDate,DeviceObject` \r\nWill show a list of shadow copies.  My newest one was number 6, so I copied that to from the command below (n.b. I added a trailing \\ to the name) \r\n`cmd /c mklink /d c:\\ShadowCopy \"\\\\?\\GLOBALROOT\\Device\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy6\\\"`\r\n\r\nNow I can copy from `C:\\ShadowCopy\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6` to restore 6\r\nDelete C:\\ShadowCopy when done.\r\n\r\n**Alternatively** download the ZIP version of 6.2.4, unblock and expand into the 6 directory. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
