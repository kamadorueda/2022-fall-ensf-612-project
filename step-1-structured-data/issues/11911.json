Add a reference to Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK 7.0.0-rc.2 \r\n\r\n# Expected/Actual behavior\r\n\r\nI was not expecting my build folder to contain a bunch of language folders (es,de,cs,zh-Hans,pl etc.) with each having a copy of Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.resources.dll and Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.resources.dll within them.\r\n\r\n# Question/Issue\r\n\r\nIs this actually expected? And if so is there a recommended workaround for when we are not trying to include other languages? \r\n",
