Typically it is not good practice for these package managers to write to `/usr/local`.\r\n",

They know better than PowerShell where the distribution-managed modules will be installed.\r\n\r\nWhere they can configure that depends on the user's login manager; _systemd-logind_ supports drop-in files in `/etc/environment.d`, which a powershell package could place per-distribution and standard shadow _login_ may get env vars from `/etc/environment` (because of _pam_env.so_, which is broadly enabled by default.)\r\n\r\nSince anything that exists in `$Env:PSModulePath` before powershell loads seems to be combined with the user's local module path, this shouldn't present an integration issue.",
