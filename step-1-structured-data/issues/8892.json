  "body": "As elaborated in this blog post [PowerShell Constrained Language mode and the Dot-Source Operator](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/2018/11/26/powershell-constrained-language-mode-and-the-dot-source-operator/), there are caveats in constrained mode.\r\n\r\nHere is our use case, we dynamically generate a `.psm1` which only contains statements like `Import-Module A.psd1` `Import-Module B.psd1`, etc. We flush the generated `.psm1` file to disk and add it to the [InitializationScripts](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.runspaces.runspaceconfiguration.initializationscripts?view=powershellsdk-1.1.0#System_Management_Automation_Runspaces_RunspaceConfiguration_InitializationScripts) to run.\r\n\r\nEverything works fine in non-Constrained Language mode, but once we turned on Constrained Language mode, the shell suddenly could not see and run the dynamically generated `.psm1` file even though the file exists. Is there any known issue with Constrained Language mode for this use case?",
