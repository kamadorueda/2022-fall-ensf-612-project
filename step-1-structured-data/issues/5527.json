  "body": "It appears that signing puts the signed binaries in a folder called [signed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/400747040300bb6a1a2dfcaec846a8fca092aadc/tools/releaseBuild/packagesigning.xml).  The current packaging copies the signed binaries over the unsigned binaries, but the signed folder is a child folder of the unsigned binaries so it gets added to the zip resulting in duplicate files that aren't used.  Fix is to remove the `signed` folder after copying the signed binaries.\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5506\r\n",
