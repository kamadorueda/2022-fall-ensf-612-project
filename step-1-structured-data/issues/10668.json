  "body": "Types that implement `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider` do not have the usual intrinsic members, such as the hidden `.psobject` and `pstypenames` properties, or the `.Count` and `.Length` properties, which one would expect to be present on _any_ object (other than `$null` in the case of the reflection properties).\r\n\r\n@SeeminglyScience [points out](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10654) that \"in most cases PowerShell is going to let `JObject` [a type that implements `IDynamicMetaObjectProvider`] decide how it's bound\", so the problem may be related to that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Instantiate a type that implements IDynamicMetaObjectProvider\r\n$obj = [Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject]::Parse('{\"foo\":1}')\r\n\r\n$obj.psobject | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty\r\n$obj.pstypenames | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty\r\n$obj.Length | Should -Be 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests should succeed.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests fail, because these properties unexpectedly don't exist.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.4\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.18362.145\r\n```\r\n",
