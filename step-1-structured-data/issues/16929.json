  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nMy profile takes ~640 ms to load which is barely noticeable but I get this extra message every single time I start a new session:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177512/155819540-d0aef7e2-9bdf-4cd3-a0fc-c8cf511f36a7.png)\r\n\r\nWith the new minimized startup banner in preview.2, can we consider bumping the threshold for showing the timing info on how long it takes to process my profile?  Maybe from the current 500 ms to 1 s?  It's handy to know if my long startup time is due to my profile but maybe not every time I start a new session.  I know my profile takes a bit longer and I'm at peace with that.  If only PowerShell wouldn't keep reminding me every time it starts.  :-)\r\n\r\nAlso, I notice that the wall time is noticeably longer than 637ms from seeing `PowerShell 7.xx` to my prompt appearing.  It appears to me to be closer to 1500ms.  So the profile loading accounts for less than half the actual startup time.  But I get that the only knob the user has to twiddle is what they're doing in their profile.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n**Option 1:** Consider adding a new start up parameter `-TimeProfileLoad` or something like that.  Only when this parameter is specified would you display the profile processing time.  In this case, you could also consider being more granular e.g.:\r\n```\r\n> pwsh -TimeProfileLoad\r\nPowerShell 7.3.0-preview.3\r\n 1100ms : Loading C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7-preview\\profile.ps1\r\n  637ms : Loading C:\\Users\\Keith\\Documents\\PowerShell\\profile.ps1\r\n   75ms : Loading C:\\Users\\Keith\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1\r\n 1812ms : Loading system and personal profiles\r\n C:\\Users\\Keith> \r\n ```\r\n\r\n**Option 2:** Perhaps we just bump the current threshold for displaying the message up to 1 sec.\r\n\r\n**Option 3:**  We make the threshold configurable.  It defaults to the current 500 ms but folks could adjust that based on their profile.  IOW I might want to see this if it is taking longer than normal to process my profile.  Where \"normal\" is what you'd configure for your threshold value.",

I look at it and think \"what can I do knowing it took 600ms or 700ms to load the profile.\" I waste more time looking at the message than that. So I'd set a very high threshold. Those who want to know this every time can set 1ms.  \r\n",

Rather than chasing a unknown number to set the timeout - We would propose a new switch for pwsh.exe that enables/disables the message. The default would be disabled to respect the new concise view of the prompt. There will be no timeout, the time will be displayed (even 1ms) if enabled.",
