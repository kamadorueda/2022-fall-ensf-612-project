This occurs regardless of whether you've previously installed the stable version of PowerShell. Attempting to invoke `pwsh` after installation simply fails with a command not found error (if you haven't already installed the stable version) or will execute the previously installed stable version instead (if you have).\r\n\r\nAm I missing something here? :/\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAble to execute `pwsh` directly after finishing `sudo apt-get install powershell-preview`\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nCommand not found error.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nWSL Ubuntu 18.04, installing powershell-preview (v7-preview4 I assume?)\r\n",
