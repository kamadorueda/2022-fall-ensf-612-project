      "body": "@figueroadavid as with some other file-handling cmdlets (e.g., `Rename-Item`) it appears `Compress-Archive` does not create output by default and requires that you use `-PassThru` to do so.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think that module is maintained in this repo itself; I'm actually surprised this doesn't behave like `New-Item` as well and provide output by default given that it is also creating a file item, but you might submit that as a request on the [Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive](https://github.com/PowerShell/Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive) repo. \ud83d\ude42 ",
