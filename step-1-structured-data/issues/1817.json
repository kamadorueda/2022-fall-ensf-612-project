      "body": "This is currently a limitation of .NET Core (or really, a design decision due to .NET being originally created for Windows).\n\n``` powershell\n> [IO.FileInfo]::new(\"README.md\").Attributes\nNormal\n```\n\nPowerShell file objects are based on the C# classes, and the C# FileInfo class uses their [FileAttributes](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/d0dc5fc099946adc1035b34a8b1f6042eddb0c75/src/System.IO.FileSystem.Primitives/ref/System.IO.FileSystem.Primitives.cs#L19) enum, which in PowerShell corresponds to the mode property.\n\nSo, while on Linux, we'd expect a \"read-only\" file to display `-r--r--r--`, in C#, we get:\n\n``` powershell\n> chmod a-w README.md\n> [IO.FileInfo]::new(\"README.md\").Attributes\nReadOnly\n```\n\nAnd in PowerShell parlance:\n\n``` powershell\n> Get-Item ./README.md\n\n\n    Directory: /PowerShell\n\n\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\n----                -------------         ------ ----\n--r---          8/16/16   2:51 PM           5231 README.md\n```\n\nWhether or not PowerShell should ignore the C# object and instead \"do its own thing\" to get Linux-like file modes is a reasonable question, but would require a design change.\n",
