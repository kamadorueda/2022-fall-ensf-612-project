We tried to address that in #12943 but recently hit a failure where the new form of the tests using the gateway address also failed consistently across builds.\r\n\r\nGiven that the DNS issue was resolved, this changes the tests that have been failing back to using the hostname.\r\n\r\nThere's also a test that didn't work with DNS, was working with the gateway address, but is not working now. That test is now marked as pending.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
