  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nInstall powershell on Ubuntu 16.04  with the latest build of the psrp client (1.3.0).  Domain join the machine/vm and attempt to connect to a windows machine using -Authentication Kerberos.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nThe connection succeeds.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nThe connection fails with an access denied.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe problem occurs due to a PSRP's dynamic loading of libgssapi_krb5.  Since powershell itself has no explicit dependency, the binary cannot be resolved. Additionally, the while the dependency refers to libgssapi_krb5.so, current versions are .so.2 and .so.2.2.  The solution is to create a symbolic link to the installed binary as libgssapi_krb5.so to ensure it is resolved.\r\n",
