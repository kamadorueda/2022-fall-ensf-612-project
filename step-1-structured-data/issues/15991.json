I was installing System.Management.Automation when I got the error regarding missing Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Diagnostics.dll. So I installed \r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Commands.Diagnostics. I then had to install a console host (I don't remember the exact error). I think I found it in Microsoft.Powershell.SDK. I was good after that.",
