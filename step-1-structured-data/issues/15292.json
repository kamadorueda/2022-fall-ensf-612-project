  "body": "We have a powershell script we use to package our non-UWP app into a APPX/MSIX, which leverages the `Appx` module for PowerShell. We recently had to force it to be called by Windows Powershell due to 7.1 seemingly removing ability to load the Appx module.\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module Appx\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nSuccess, no output/error printed at all. And ability to call cmdlets like Add-AppxPackage\r\n\r\nThis last worked I believe on PowerShell Core 7.0.3\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nImport-Module: Operation is not supported on this platform. (0x80131539)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
