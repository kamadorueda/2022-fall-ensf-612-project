  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI just want powershell to auto-update (in VScode insiders) automatically without my 'managing it' with extra commands, clicks/diversions of workflow. I'm on win 10 insiders, all software is the latest available. \r\n\r\nCurrently I have to go to Windows Update which says I'm up-to-date (last checked 5 minutes ago...), then back to aka.ms to actually get and install the minor update. WASTED TIME FOR ME. Is there some way to just say \"auto-install\" powershell updates as soon as they are available? I'm happy to tolerate any bugs, as I'm NOT a power user.\r\n\r\nThx.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nNO time out of my work flow.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nAbout 4 minutes of (not so agonizing) clicking\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Projects\\rangertrak> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### OS Data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nVersion    Caption\r\n-------    -------\r\n10.0.19044 Microsoft Windows 10 Pro\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Windows update log\r\n\r\n```markdown\r\nPS C:\\Projects\\rangertrak> Get-WindowsUpdateLog\r\n...\r\nWindowsUpdate.log written to C:\\Users\\John\\Desktop\\WindowsUpdate.log\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n-",
