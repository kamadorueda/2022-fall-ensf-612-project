      "body": "@vexx32 technically intellisense refers to automatic suggestions like when typing in an editor.  PowerShell's tab completion often gets referred to as intellisense (I have bad habit of this) when it isn't really. The feature proposed in lzybkr/PSReadLine#687 would count, or something like the [PowerTab](https://github.com/jasonmarcher/PowerTab) project if it was triggered on key press.",
