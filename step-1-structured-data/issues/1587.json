  "body": "macOS, removing the PSReadLine module makes the console essentially nonfunctional. Up-arrow doesn't work, backspace doesn't work correctly. Additionally, note that the default PSReadLine coloring doesn't work well in the default Terminal color scheme (which is why I'd tried unloading PSReadLine to begin with). It's perhaps worth noting that Mac/Linux users tend to have a broader range of color schemes in their console window; assuming the traditional PowerShell dark blue will rarely hold out. I might suggest disabling coloring by default, if possible, and just stick with monocolor text using the console's defaults at the time.\n",
