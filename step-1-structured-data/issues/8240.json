  "body": "Hello PowerShell Team, \r\n\r\nSorry very much to disturb you. I am not sure if it is a bug in PowerShell Core or from .NET Core - so please correct me if i am wrong ;) \r\n\r\nBackground : \r\n----------------------\r\nI and some other people try to bring Numpy into .NET world as https://github.com/Oceania2018/NumSharp. \r\nSince we love .NET in general we started some language specific projects in src folder for Ironpython and PowerShell Core. PowerShell would be an extrem elegant and powerful language in numeric we find. We want to be as close to Numpy as possible. So also want to offer the possibility to transform a bitmap object from System.Drawing namespace into a NumSharp NDArray.  \r\n\r\nProblem : \r\n-----------\r\nBefore all worked fine. But when we tried to add the nuget package System.Drawing.Common to our project PowerShell can not construct any object from our Project. \r\n\r\nIt was tried : \r\n- build the C# based PS Module and using Import-Module -Name ./NameOfDll.dll\r\n- using Add-Type -Path ./NameOfDll.dll directly to add the .NET types\r\n- using Add-Type -Path ./System.Drawing.Common directly\r\n\r\nThere is always the same error and can not figure out what it means. \r\n\r\n**format-default : The following exception occurred while retrieving members : \"Could not load file or assembly 'System.Drawing.Common, Version=4.0.0.1, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=cc7b13ffcd2ddd51' The system cannot find the file specific.**\r\n\r\nThe nuget package is https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common. \r\n\r\nMy PS Version is \r\n- Version 6.1.0\r\n- PSEdition Core \r\n- OS Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\n\r\nI know it is very unprecise and not 100% PowerShell specific \u2026 but I would be already happy if I could get a better clue what could be the error. \r\n\r\nThanks for your time team. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Does PS using the Bitmap from a compatibility package to old PowerShell? I am not absolutly sure why this Assembly seems to be added when start PS and in C# not. ^^' ",
