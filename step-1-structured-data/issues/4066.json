  "body": "Note: This problem has been known for a long time - for background, see [this SO answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/35493243/45375).\r\n\r\n`Read-Host -Prompt` - at least in the regular console host and in the ISE in PSv3+ - accidentally exposes functionality that only makes sense in the context of prompting a user for missing mandatory parameter values, namely, the so-called _prompt commands_ that start with `!`.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\n* Happens only when the `-Prompt` parameter is used.\r\n\r\n* The ISE in PSv3 through PSv5.1 accepts `!` as a _literal_ `!`, but the console host complains about an invalid prompt command (see below); even the ISE, however, interprets `!?` as a prompt command, for instance. (Note that the ISE in v2- used its own, GUI prompt for `Read-Host`, and was therefore not affected.)\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nRun in a console window / terminal.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> Read-Host -Prompt 'hi'\r\nhi: !  # The \"!\" is entered by the user.\r\n\r\n\r\n> Read-Host -Prompt 'hi'\r\nhi: !? # The \"!?\" is entered by the user.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n!\r\n!?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, whatever the user entered should be output as-is, with no interpretation whatsoever.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\"!\" cannot be recognized as a valid Prompt command.\r\nNo help is available for hi.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, \r\n\r\n* `!` was interpreted as the start of a prompt command.\r\n\r\n* `!?` was interpreted as the command to print the \"parameter's\" help message, which, of course, only makes sense in the context of prompting for mandatory parameter values.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta (v6.0.0-beta.2) on macOS 10.12.5\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta (v6.0.0-beta.2) on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta (v6.0.0-beta.2) on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.14393)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.15063.413 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\n```\r\n",
