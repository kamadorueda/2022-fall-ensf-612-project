The System.Security.Cryptography.Native.dylib is also broken in addition to System.Net.Http.Native.dylib.\n\nSteps to reproduce for \"System.Security.Cryptography.Native.dylib\":\n\n```\nInvoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri \"https://google.com\"\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n```\nThe type initializer for 'System.Net.Http.CurlHandler' threw an exception.\nIn an inner exception: Unable to load DLL 'System.Security.Cryptography.Native': The specified module could not be found.

A libcurl built with OpenSSL is required.\"\n```\n\nIf I run the workaround it is ok (note that it would report an error that it couldn't execute the script block which is an indicator that the callback was called - so it got redirected ok).\n",
