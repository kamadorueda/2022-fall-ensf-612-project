  "body": "> Note: Ported from bug 9318376\r\n\r\nJEA transcripts, unlike regular PowerShell session transcripts, output all of the session information unformatted. That means that auditors trying to read a JEA transcript have to parse together the output to understand what command a user invoked rather than just seeing exactly what the user ran. The request is to try and simplify the JEA transcript format so that it is similar to the standard transcript format.\r\n\r\nExample of a standard transcript file for someone who ran `Get-Service Dns`:\r\n```none\r\nPS C:\\Users\\Administrator> Get-Service Dns\r\n\r\nStatus   Name               DisplayName\r\n------   ----               -----------\r\nRunning  dns                DNS Server\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample of a JEA transcript for the same command:\r\n```none\r\nPS>CommandInvocation(Get-Service): \"Get-Service\"\r\n>> ParameterBinding(Get-Service): name=\"Name\"; value=\"Dns\"\r\n>> CommandInvocation(Out-Default): \"Out-Default\"\r\n>> ParameterBinding(Out-Default): name=\"InputObject\"; value=\"Dns\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRunning  Dns                DNS Server\r\n```",
