Use $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nBy the way, this site handles only PowerShell v6.0.0-alpha.xx. And/or anything that's PowerShell Core module related.\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell (Version: 3, 4, and 5.x) all other non-Core module related issues, you better use the following UserVoice link:\r\nhttps://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell \r\n\r\nThis way the issues will be routed to the proper group.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n",
