  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\nI make use of `Format-List -View`, `Format-Table -View` etc a lot, and always try to provide multiple views for objects in the packages I maintain. However, these views are not discoverable - there is no autocompletion, and providing an unambiguous prefix also doesn't work, you have to remember and type out the whole view name.\r\n\r\nIf the output type of the previous pipeline step is known (i.e. because the cmdlet has `[OutputType()]` declared, it's a variable, or a `ForEach-Object` etc), PowerShell should look up what views of that type (list/table/custom) are available and autocomplete them. E.g. `Format-List -View v` should autocomplete to `Format-List -View Verbose` if such a view is defined.",
