  "body": "This is part of #1118 \nThe version of WsMan.Management nupkg was bumped to 1.0.1-rc1 in order to let appveyor pick the new package to the feed. So I need to update the project.json of Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management to depend on the 1.0.1-\\* version of WsMan.Management nupkg.\ncc @vors It turns out the 1.0.0 version WsMan.mgmt.nupkg is still kept in the feed, so I have to update this project.json file to make it depend on the new nupkg.\n",

      "body": "@andschwa yes, that's what we did. Unfortunately our nuget feed alreadt contains version **1.0.0** which is higher then any prerelease version. So we can either clean-up the feed (require recreating the project and updating of url of nuget feed), or we can bump the version).\n\nI think bumping the version is easier. We need to figure out the right versioning story for our produced nuget packages and for pre-build nuget packages.\n",
