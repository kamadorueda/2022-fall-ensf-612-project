  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nHello\r\n\r\n### The issue\r\nin our daily work (we've created more than 5k PowerShell Scrips) we mostly have runtime errors because functions do not initialize variables in all code-paths and then the value of the parent (or even global!) variable with the same name is used.\r\n\r\n### Therefore: Please allow us to disable variable inheritance for functions\r\n\r\n#### The benefit of inherited variables in functions\r\nProfessional scripts almost never want to access global variables in functions\r\nIf they do:\r\n- it is very rare\r\n- they usually need single variables, which can then be explicitly addressed in the function\r\n\r\n#### The Workarounds\r\nI know, there are workarounds to manually disable inheritance in functions, e.g. by creating a local variable of every global variable and initializing them to $null. Or by creating a new PowerShell process. Or by using ScriptBlocks, Jobs, etc.\r\nIn the end, however, they are all very tedious.\r\n\r\nI have added some ideas for the technical implementation below.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, kind regards,\r\nThomas\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n### Ideas for discussion\r\nAs always, it's tricky to choose an elegant, sustainable concept for such requirements - and PowerShell has great architects, thank goodness. I'll give a few concept ideas anyway:\r\n\r\nVariable inheritance into Functions could be disabled by:\r\n- a `#Command` similar to: `#Requires -Version 7`\r\n- by the `private:` scope like: `Function private:My-Func() {} `\r\n\r\n### By the way, the implementation of this requirement should be quite simple:\r\n\r\nAs soon as a variable is accessed in a function for the 1st time, \r\nPowerShell does not copy the value from an existing parent\r\nbut simply initializes it by the default value.\r\n",

And the people who understand the flag would write code which didn't need it.\r\n\r\nSweeping generalizations like _\"Professional scripts almost never want to access global variables in functions\"_  bother me a bit, because quite a lot of scripts refer to $pwd. or $psversionTable, or $host, or $isWindows, or the various preference variables. Environment variables are, by definition, global, and that's where we for go username, computerName and various paths.  In many cases information needed by many functions - or by multiple calls to the same function (e.g. remote session details) lives in script-scoped variables. Some information is global in nature.  \r\n That's very different from saying \"don't use globals to do the job of parameters\" and \"don't access working variables which belong to other bits of code\" - neither of those _are_ global in nature.\r\n\r\nWhen we get a lecture on what \"Professional scripts\" do and don't do, it invites the response that professional scripts take a bit more trouble about initializing variables.

I hope these variables are not constant and are not read-only. In my opinion, this is a management problem.",
