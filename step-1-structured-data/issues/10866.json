  "body": "Hello, I am currently working on some Azure scripts where I need to perform a series of operations on each of the subscriptions under our tenant. I encountered a large problem when using Foreach-Object -Parallel. After some debugging I came up with this short script as a means of reproducing the issue.\r\n\r\n`$subscriptiondata = Get-AzSubscription`\r\n`$subscriptiondata | Foreach-Object -parallel {`\r\n`    $log = \"Creating file for subscription $($_.name)...\" | Out-File -FilePath` `\"C:\\temp\\test\\$($_.name).txt\" -Force`\r\n`    $log =  \"Setting the session context to subscription $($_.name)...\" | Out-File -FilePath` `\"C:\\temp\\test\\$($_.name).txt\" -Force -Append`\r\n`    Set-AzContext -Name $_.name -Subscription $_.id -Force`\r\n`    $context = Get-AzContext`\r\n`    $log = \"The context has been set to $($context.Subscription.Name)\" | Out-File -FilePath` `\"C:\\temp\\test\\$($_.name).txt\" -Force -Append`\r\n`    $Array = @(1..50)`\r\n`    Foreach ($number in $array){`\r\n`        $context = Get-AzContext`\r\n`    $log = \"The context has been set to $($context.Subscription.Name)\" | Out-File -FilePath` `\"C:\\temp\\test\\$($_.name).txt\" -Force -Append`\r\n`    }`\r\n`} -ThrottleLimit 10`\r\n\r\n(Apologies for the poor formatting of the script above - github keeps screwing with it)\r\n\r\nThe above script proves that for some reason, the Azure session context is not getting applied correctly to individual parallel sessions and seems to somehow be \"leaking\" from its original session to the others. Quite problematic, as it forces us abandon the parallel processing for this particular script. I hope this can get resolved in the future releases.",

      "body": "This is going to be ultimately an issue of how the Azure PowerShell module handles the session. You might want to open it as an issue on their repo instead, since the way they manage session data is ultimately up to them. https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, you can bypass it by doing a more manual implementation and utilising `Start-Job`, which will invoke each script in a separate process, instead of `foreach-object -parallel`. \ud83d\ude42  \n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/6844498?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicon.ico\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell\">Azure/azure-powershell</a></strong></div><div>Microsoft Azure PowerShell.
