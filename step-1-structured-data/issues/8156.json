  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- From a pwsh session, add a new CA .pem file to `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` (or equivalent location for your Linux distro).\r\n- Run `update-ca-trust` (or equivalent command for your Linux distro).\r\n- Try and use `Invoke-RestMethod` (or similar) on an HTTP API using TLS. It will fail saying it doesn't trust the certificate.\r\n- Exit pwsh\r\n- Enter pwsh\r\n- Try the same `Invoke-RestMethod` (or similar) operation, and it will succeed\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nUsing `Invoke-RestMethod` (or similar) after running `update-ca-trust` (or similar) should succeed without having to exit pwsh and start a new pwsh process.\r\n",
