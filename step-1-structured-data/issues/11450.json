Get-Job -? shows one syntax for requesting by state and another for requesting by name . \r\nI'm not saying the current design is good or bad , I can see a valid request to be able to combine the criteria, but that's not what is implemented now. \r\n\r\n\"not found\" isn't consistent.

It wouldn't make sense to change this for a single cmdlet for consistency, so it would likely have to be a change made across the board.  That said, we've all worked around this behavior for so long that changing it how would break a whole lot of scripts.",
