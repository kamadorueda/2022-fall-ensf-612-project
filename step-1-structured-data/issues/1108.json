However, if PowerShell ships with LocalAccounts, then probably the best thing we can do is throw platform not supported until if/when these are implemented.\n\nThe alternative (and ugly) work-around is to `#if !LINUX` guard the files.\n\nThe new schema _may_ provide for a `compile` under the `configurations` (if they're under `buildOptions`), but this wouldn't really be viable until https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/3577 is fixed, and the `compile` sections (and any `buildOptions` property IMHO) get merged.\n",
