Recently, I received a couple of complaints regarding being unable to type into the PowerShell 7 window.\r\n\r\nThe problem has been confirmed across multiple Azure tenants and has been repro'd in both Windows 10 and Windows 11 pools.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n1) Open AVD with native Windows client\r\n2) Open PowerShell 7 \r\n3) Start typing (this will work!)\r\n4) Open same AVD pool from web client (this should take over your existing session and kill the native client session)\r\n5) Try typing in the same PowerShell 7 window (this will NOT work)\r\n\r\nWhat does work when using AVD web client:\r\n- Typing in PS7 terminal in VS Code\r\n- Ctrl + C (break) works in PS7 window\r\n- Copy/paste works in PS7 window\r\n- Typing in any other window/app works, including PowerShell 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nI see what I type.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nSee nothing. :(\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nMajor  Minor  Patch  PreReleaseLabel BuildLabel\r\n-----  -----  -----  --------------- ----------\r\n7      2      4\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
