Still waiting on the approval, but to be honest with a non-permissive license, this will likely not be approved as I don't think it's compatible with the MIT license.  Your best option might be to publish this as a separate module on the PowerShellGallery as long as it adheres to the AGPL.",

I think the alternate path is for you to publish this code under AGPL in your own repo and publish the resulting module on PowerShellGallery and then there is no issue with someone using a AGPL module with our MIT PSCore6.",
