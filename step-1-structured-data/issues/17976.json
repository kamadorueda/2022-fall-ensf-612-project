  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nThe mklink command is able to create junction point using volume GUID instead of volume letter with a syntax like `mklink /J %USERPROFILE%\\src \\\\?\\Volume{953caf26-bdb1-42fa-ba14-a392223eb61a}\\src\\`.\r\n\r\nThe `New-Item` PowerShell cmdlet cannot work with the volume GUID, it would be useful if `New-Item` could also create junction/symlink using the volume GUID\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
