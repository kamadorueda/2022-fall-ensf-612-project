  "body": "Anyway, I was reading through [the third party license list](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt) and taking deep breaths. I suppose that every PowerShell host must now redistribute the entire license file, right? I'm not exactly looking for a lawyer's opinion -- but it seems like this should be mentioned as a reminder in any documentation created about hosting PowerShell Core, because it's a major change from hosting Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nAs a side note:\r\n\r\nSomeone pointed out that there's [a _lot_ of libraries listed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt#L160-L414) as being under the \r\n\r\n```\r\nMICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS\r\nMICROSOFT .NET LIBRARY\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is, you know ... the old .NET license which is a bit confusing about redistribution.\r\n\r\nI should point out that [this section](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt#L466-L474) in particular is being [decried](https://listas.trisquel.info/pipermail/trisquel-users/2017-May/077549.html) online as non-free:\r\n\r\n```\r\n4.

In addition to NuGet packages, currently there are modules and assemblies I have to outright _copy from PowerShell's deployment package_ (i.e. not just the SDK from NuGet).\r\n\r\nThis whole thing (plus the monthly bugfix release) has made me a bit nervous about the maintenance. I don't suppose you guys want a PR to just add the jupyter kernel to the core? ;-)",

The Chocolatey validator automatically failed me because I don't have a license file. \r\n\r\nAfter double-checking, it turns out the same is true of PowerShell releases: there's _no license file in the PowerShell release **except**_ the `license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt`\r\n\r\nY'all need to sort this out. \ud83d\ude15 Currently we have one license file and two (or three) third party license files -- but only one of the third party license files ships in the product (even the main license file doesn't).\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/LICENSE.txt\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/ThirdPartyNotices.txt\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/license_thirdparty_proprietary.txt\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/assets/AppImageThirdPartyNotices.txt\r\n\r\nTo make matters worse, there are also source code files with **Apache** License in them.
