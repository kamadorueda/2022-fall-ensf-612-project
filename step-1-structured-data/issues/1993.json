The second appearance disappears on input.\n<img width=\"296\" alt=\"screen shot cropped\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/111144/17837300/c164434a-67a7-11e6-9b67-7a1773002f62.png\">\n## Environment data\n\nPowerShell 6.0.0-alpha.9 on OS X 10.11.5\n\n``` powershell\nName                           Value\n----                           -----\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha\nPSEdition                      Core\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.9\nCLRVersion\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n```\n\nExpected behaviour is seen on PSVersion 5.1.14393.0 and 6.0.0-alpha.9 on Windows 10 14393.51\n",

      "body": "I don't know if that is a bug not but the problem is that the host calls the prompt function to **get a string** to use as a prompt.  Your function is NOT returning a string which is why the prompt is still \"PS>\".\n\nJust to be clear - it is totally fine to do all sorts of processing in your prompt function.  \nIt is just that at the end, you need to return a string if you want the prompt to be different.\n",
