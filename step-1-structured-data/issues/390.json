  "body": "Currently, when the shell shuts down, it leaves the TTY with the echo mode turned off. We are working around this by turning it back on with `stty echo` in the run.sh script; however, we should fix the root cause.  Implemented here  https   github.com dotnet corefx commit 2651c35f47b3ce469418ff0d4d3836659330b99e#diff cd7359287d9d1d84aa61126a9156e890R846  There must be a race condition or something causing the termios not to get set back correctly.  https   github.com dotnet corefx issues 5109  Fixed, merged, and packaged by .NET team.
