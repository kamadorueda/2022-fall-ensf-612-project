I am not very conversant yet with VSCode and I am having trouble getting the debugger to work and stop on the set breakpoints. Can you advise on what I need to configure to make it work please, I have had no success this afternoon apart from I can get the terminal to run v7.3p5 but I cannot debug the script to see what is going on.
