  "body": "Note: This is a regression from 7.1. It affects all terminals on all platforms.\r\n\r\nExecuting a `Write-Verbose` / `Write-Warning` / `Write-Debug` command that produces visible - and therefore colored - output makes the colors linger and affects subsequent output (that doesn't explicitly control coloring)\r\n\r\n**Update**: The problem is connected to the `PSAnsiRendering` experimental feature and does _not_ occur while it is disabled.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nWrite-Warning foo; 'bar'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`foo` should print in yellow, `bar` in the default colors.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nBoth `foo` and `bar` print in yellow, and the subsequent prompt string prints in yellow too.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.2\r\n```\r\n",
