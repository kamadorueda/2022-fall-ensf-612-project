I don't recall that the exact issue with the MSIX was, but I think @SteveL-MSFT and team managed to sort it out for the next release, if I'm not mistaken? \ud83e\udd14",

      "body": "@vexx32 talking to the AppX team, it seems that because our pkg requires unvirtualized resources (because it's a shell!), it won't allow installing by simply double clicking on the pkg.  Using `Add-AppXPackage` is required to install the msix pkg.  The msix is planned to be available in the MS App Store by Preview.6.  However, for anyone doing offline installs of the msix, they will still need to use `Add-AppXPackage`.\r\n\r\nI'll submit a PR to update https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-6 with instructions for installing the MSIX.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/media/logos/logo-ms-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows\">Installing PowerShell Core on Windows - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>Information about installing PowerShell Core on Windows</div></blockquote>",
