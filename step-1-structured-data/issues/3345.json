We should scrub through [all strings in the repository](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=%22windows+powershell%22) and change these to \"PowerShell\" where applicable (i.e. for everything that isn't FullCLR-specific). \r\n\r\n",

Going through the code, it seems like all instances of \"Windows PowerShell\" are either directly or indirectly connected to those resources, which makes me wary of submitting a PR with any conversions.",
