      "body": "@kasini3000, thanks for the comment. Another datapoint that also leads to my original expectation:\r\nhttps://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/powershell-foreach-object-parallel-feature/ \r\n\r\n\"The -ThrottleLimit parameter limits the number of script blocks running in parallel at a given time...\"\r\n\r\n\"The primary addition is the ability to limit the number of concurrent scripts running at a given time with the -ThrottleLimit parameter. Throttling is accomplished by a PSTaskPool class that holds running tasks (running scripts), and has a settable size limit which is set to the throttle limit value. An Add method allows tasks to be added to the pool, but if it is full then the method blocks until a new slot becomes available.\"\r\n\r\nGiven this, if one sets the ThrottleLimit, one naturally expects to see no more than that number of jobs in the Running state as per get-job.\r\n\r\nRegarding your suggested workarounds, the PWSH workaround provided in my original comment is highly preferred over the two suggestions you provided as:\r\n1) It's OS agnostic.\r\n2) Stalling for 5 seconds to run each iteration leads to longer then necessary script exection. Even doing 1 second stalling as I originally provided ended up being too high in comparison to 500 ms. Going from 500 ms to 250 ms does provide modest execution time gains, but at high CPU utilization in comparison to 500ms+.\r\n\r\nThanks anyways!",

      "body": "> \"The -ThrottleLimit parameter limits the number of script blocks running in parallel at a given time...\"\r\n\r\nI think you have confused script blocks and jobs.  This\r\n```\r\n $null=foreach-object -parallel $process_r -inputobject $datadict_r -throttlelimit 8 \r\n```\r\n\r\n **does not run** `process_r`   for each object in `$datadict_r`  with up to 8 copies running concurrently. \r\nIt runs ONE copy of `process_r` which receives the whole of  `$datadict_r` \r\n\r\nSpecifying `-AsJob` sends it off to run as a job. \r\n\r\nSomething like this \r\n```\r\n1..32 | ForEach-Object -Parallel { sleep 10 ; \"$_  \" + [datetime]::Now.ToString() }  -AsJob -ThrottleLimit 8\r\n```\r\ncreates a job with 32 script blocks to run, run in parallel, 8 at a time. \r\n\r\n```\r\nforeach ($i in 1..10) {\r\n1..32 | ForEach-Object -Parallel { sleep 10 ; \"$_  \" + [datetime]::Now.ToString() }  -AsJob -ThrottleLimit 8\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCreates 10 jobs, each of which has 32 script blocks to run, run in parallel, 8 at a time.  Giving 80 concurrent script blocks/threads,\r\n\r\nThe text you quoted is misleading because it does not say **\"in that instance of for each parallel**\"  you can probably imagine it is difficult for `foreach` in one job to know if `foreach` is running in other jobs and how many threads are being used when it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
