  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nAdd a line documenting that the command to run PowerShell is `pwsh`, and not `powershell` like might be expected.\r\n(I spent like 10 minutes trying to figure out why my fresh install wasn't working before I read further down in the manual install docs to find the correct command.)\r\n\r\nAlso, would it be worth it to add a command to the install process, making an `alias powershell='pwsh'`?  Or at least a line in the above docs?  That's what I ended up doing in my `.zshrc` for when future me forgets.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\nNote: Please mark anything not applicable to this PR `NA`.\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [x] Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ NA ] User facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - [ NA ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [ NA ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n    - [ NA ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n",
