  "body": "This is largely a spin-off of closed [issue 7495](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7495).\r\n\r\nCurrently the `Test-ModuleManifest` will fail if it is unable to find a module listed in requiredmodule. This can be problematic, as some modules can not be dynamically installed from the PSGallery (For example those installed by windows features like \"ADFS\"). This makes using `test-modulemanifest` in the scope of an automated test significantly more complicated.\r\n\r\na switch would be nice to be able to set this module to check syntax only in these scenarios.\r\n\r\n",
