  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen a new directory is created the user should be able to specify the owner and ACL for the new directory.\r\nSpecific use case is the creation of target directory for our users endpoint backups. The user needs read-only access, the backup software account needs full Access. Adding these permissions after creation of the directories (using `Set-Acl` or alternatives is proving problematic and Powershell does not seem to offer a way to change the owner).\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nOne option is to add parameters like those of `New-SmbShare`: `-FullAccess` and `-ReadAccess`.\r\nOn linux an implementation similar to `install` (Options `-o`, `-g`, `-m`)",

If there are problems with set-acl  and ownership on an existing item they should be resolved, rather than fixing them only as part of creating an item.  \r\nThe mkdir command _could_ (and perhaps should) be adapted to do ownership and permissions along with calling New-item. \r\n\r\n",
