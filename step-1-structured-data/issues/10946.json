This OSS project https://github.com/microsoft/Tx supports blg using a different set of APIs so there's a possibility of bringing back those cmdlets.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",

The PowerShell community does not appear to place a high priority on these commands. It is the Working Group's belief that use of these commands is very low and thus doesn't warrant the work effort. Still, a community contribution in the PowerShell Gallery would be welcome.",
