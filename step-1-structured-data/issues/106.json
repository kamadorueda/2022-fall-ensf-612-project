  "body": "Per #140,  ConvertTo From Json cmdlets fail because they require System.Web.Extensions and attempt to load them at runtime   System.Reflection.Assembly.Load  System.Web.Extensions, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35  ;  CoreCLR does not have System.Web.Extensions support.  This also needs the .NET  Extended Profile,  however it's irrelevant since it would apply only if we were using the .NET Framework directly, and not CoreCLR.  Per David Fowler    That json serializer is pretty terrible. We recommend people use something like json.net instead  which by the way is what mvc uses    It does not sound like CoreCLR now PS will enable this for us, so we may have to do without. I would advise against bundling JSON.NET as it's third party, but it has an agreeable license and this could be done.  CorePS itself doesn't have these.  VSO create date - 8/4/2015 15:39:00    \n",
