  "body": "From https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/#build--test-status\r\n>To get the default OS best choice, if possible, don't use the method overloads of SslStream that take an explicit SslProtocols parameter. Otherwise, pass SslProtocols.None. We recommend that you don't use Default; setting SslProtocols.Default forces the use of SSL 3.0 /TLS 1.0 and prevents TLS 1.2.\r\n\r\nIt is for .NET Framework 4.7 - I don't know whether it applicable to .Net Core. /cc @TravisEz13 @PaulHigin ",

There is no SSL 3.0 on WebSslProtocol because HttpClient and WeRequest do not support SSL 3.0 in CoreFX (though it's not clearly documented anywhere I could find).\r\n\r\nThat Flags enum may or may not be useful for other APIs.",
