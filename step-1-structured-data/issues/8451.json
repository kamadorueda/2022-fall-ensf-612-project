  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nNested runspace debugging is now supported on non-Windows platforms after Enter-PSHostProcess was added.  However, nested debugging was broken because the Windows impersonation code portion was not fully ifdefed out.\r\n\r\nThis change removes Windows only impersonation code for cross platform builds.  It also updates the Windows impersonation flow code to work with dotNet Core.\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n```powershell\r\n# On one PowerShell shell instance run:\r\n$pid\r\n14931\r\n\r\n$ps = [powershell]::Create()\r\n$ps.AddScript('1..20 | % { sleep 1; \"Output $_\" }').Invoke()\r\n\r\n# On second PowerShell shell run:\r\nEnter-PSHostProcess -Id 14931\r\n[Process:14931]: PS > Debug-Runspace -Id 2\r\n\r\nExpect:\r\nShould be able to run a nested debug session on script.\r\n\r\nResult:\r\nCannot debug script due to \"Unsupported platform error\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

This is needed to support rare but important Windows scenarios.  I submitted a commit that re-enables these using the new dotNet RunImpersonated API.\r\n\r\nI will also update the title to reflect these new changes.",
