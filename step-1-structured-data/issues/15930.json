The new version is available via winget though, I noted. \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nNew version available as dotnet global tool update and on Chocolatey within around 24 hours of release\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nNo new version on either distribution platform after two days.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nNot applicable\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

It looks like that's also been [user driven for some of the last few releases](https://github.com/giseongeom/chocolatey-packages/commits/master/powershell.portable), so opening a PR to that repo would probably help get that part resolved.",
