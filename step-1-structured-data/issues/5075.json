  "body": "The code in `src/System.Management.Automation/engine/PSMI` is the prototype code @Indhukrishna worked on about 4 years ago to enable powershell remoting over WMI remoting. The code is not used in powershell. I synced with @Indhukrishna offline, and she is fine that we remove the code from powershell repository. The code will still be available in the internal windows powershell code base.",
