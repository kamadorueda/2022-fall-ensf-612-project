  "body": "From the quibbles department:\r\n\r\nAccording to [Approved Verbs for PowerShell Commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/developer/cmdlet/approved-verbs-for-windows-powershell-commands), the official alias prefix for `Select-*` cmdlets is `sc`, not `sl` (the latter is for `Split-*` cmdlets).\r\n\r\nTherefore, the naming-convention-compliant alias for `Select-String` should be `scs`, not `sls`.\r\n\r\nIt's probably too late to remove `sls`, but we could add `scs`.\r\n\r\nEither way, a note in the documentation would be helpful.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0\r\n```\r\n",
