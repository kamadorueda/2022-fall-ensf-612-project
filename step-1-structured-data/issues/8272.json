  "body": "right now it's possible to declare a variable as a function and invoke it but it's not very clean:\r\n```powershell\r\n$myFunction = { param( [string]$arg ) \"my arg $arg\" }\r\n\r\n# invocation\r\n$myFunction.Invoke('an arg')\r\n# or\r\n& $myFunction 'an arg'\r\n```\r\nbased on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24798389/can-i-assign-a-function-to-a-variable\r\n\r\nthe way I expected it to work is the same way functions work:\r\n```powershell\r\n$myFunction -arg 'an arg'\r\n```",

      "body": "Hmm. No, this wouldn't be possible, I don't think. A variable and a command name are fundamentally different. The variable you have contains a script block, not a function.\r\n\r\nIf you call `$myFunction.GetType()` you will get `ScriptBlock` back. If you go ahead and create a true function with this script block you will be able to invoke it as a function:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nNew-Item -Path 'Function:\\myFunction' -Value $myFunction\r\nmyFunction -arg 'an arg'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFunctions are _not_ synonymous with script blocks in PowerShell. They're two separate objects, though function objects by _definition_ contain a script block with their code stored inside.\r\n\r\nFor example, if we retrieve that function we just created and stored it in a variable, we can see it's a totally different type of object.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$function = Get-Item 'Function:\\myFunction'\r\n$function.GetType()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives us a `FunctionInfo` object. Because objects are always able to be sent as output, we cannot implicitly assume that a variable that happens to contain a function should inherently be executable as that function without some distinction from the user (in this case, it requires use of `.Invoke()` for script blocks, and the `&` call operator for functions and script blocks).\r\n\r\nIf we wanted something like this I might perhaps suggest that a new syntax could be made available as a very minimal shorthand: `&myFunction -arg $myarg` where the `&` replaces the `$` of a variable, but that is itself potentially problematic in other ways.\r\n\r\nIn brief, functions are objects just like anything else in PowerShell, and there aren't really any exceptions. If we treat variables as potentially directly invokable items, we'd be breaking a _lot_ of things, I think. \ud83d\ude04 \r\nCalling a variable in PS unilaterally retrieves the _content_ of the variable, and never invokes it for anything. I think this consistency is far more valuable than a one or two-character convenience on the command line.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, if we followed your suggestion, it would become completely impossible to pass a script block around as an object; any call to the variable would cause the script to be invoked, most likely well before you'd want to. Even basic things like a `ForEach-Object` call would be problematic:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Script = {$_ + 1}\r\n1..10 | ForEach-Object $Script\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs things currently are, this works fine. With your suggestion, this would become much more difficult to achieve, if not impossible. Nested script blocks would also become extremely problematic.",
