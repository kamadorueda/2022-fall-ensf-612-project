      "body": "Please make the title and body of your post more descriptive, given that you've already figured out that the problem is that the `sc` _alias_ (for `Set-Content`) is invoked rather than the `sc.exe` service-control _executable_.\r\n\r\nYes, it is unfortunate that in this case nothing _seems_ to happen at all (in reality, a file named `start` with content `my service` is being created, because, due to positional parameter binding, your command is equivalent to `Set-Content -Path start -Value \"my service\"`), making it harder to diagnose the problem.\r\n\r\nA simple workaround is to invoke the executable with its extension:  \r\n\r\n    sc.exe start \"my service\"\r\n\r\nOr, better yet, use PowerShell's own `Start-Service` cmdlet.\r\n",

And they are going to be left scratching their heads wondering why the ancient and venerable service controller executable doesn't seem to work anymore. Maybe the production server needs a reboot, maybe its time to restore from tape, because its very bad when this happens.\r\n\r\nFUD aside, this should at least have the decency to report that its probably not the tool the user is probably expecting when presented with a specific set of parameters, or at least never report _nothing_ when executed. It would decrease a lot of panic and stress and undo a bit of the damage of a bad design/naming choice.",
