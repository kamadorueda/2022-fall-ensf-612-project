  "body": "The current mechanism for obtaining help for a given cmdlet's provider-specific incarnation is obscure (and brittle, which is worth fixing itself):\r\n\r\nE.g., in order to get the filesystem-provider's help topic for `Get-Content`, you must use the `-Path` parameter with _any_ path that is a _implies_ the provider, e.g.:, for the registry provider (Windows):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Help Get-Item -Path HKCU:\r\n``` \r\n\r\nNote: This mechanism is currently broken in PowerShell Core - see #6495\r\n\r\nA more direct way would be to support a `-Provider` parameter that accepts:\r\n * the name of a PS provider (or an object obtained with `Get-PSProvider`)\r\n *  additionally, `None` to specifically request the abstract, provider-independent help topic.\r\n\r\nNote: \r\n\r\n* _By default_, the provider that underlies the _current location_ is targeted, which is why being able to specify `None` to explicitly is important so as to request the _abstract_ topic.\r\n\r\n* With the current `-Path` mechanism, the _documented_ approach is to use `-Path $null`, but that doesn't currently work - see #3949. (The workaround is to use a dummy drive name that doesn't exist; e.g., `Get-Help Get-Item -Path NoSuchDrive:`)\r\n\r\n\r\nWishful thinking\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Get the FileSystem-provider-specific Get-Content help topic\r\nGet-Help -Provider FileSystem Get-Content\r\n\r\n# Get the generic Get-Content help topic\r\nGet-Help -Provider None Get-Content\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWritten as of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2\r\n```\r\n",
