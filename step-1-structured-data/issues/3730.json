  "body": "Even without using wildcards, `Get-ChildItem -Recurse` allows matching items on every level of the target hierarchy, possibly filtered with `-Include` and `-Exclude`.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you use `-LiteralPath` rather than the (implied) `-Path` parameter, `-Include` and `-Exclude` are _quietly ignored_:\r\n\r\n_If_ there's a good reason for this behavior (none that I'm aware of), then at the very least a _warning_ about `-Include` / `-Exclude`  getting ignored should be issued, or a separate parameter set should prevent combining `-LiteralPath` with `-Include` / `-Exclude`.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem              $PSHOME -Recurse -Exclude *   # implies -Path $PSHOME\r\nGet-ChildItem -LiteralPath $PSHOME -Recurse -Exclude *\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nBoth calls should yield _no_ output, because all items should be excluded by virtue of `-Exclude *`.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe 2nd command, due to `-Exclude *` getting _ignored_, outputs the entire subtree of `$PSHOME`.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-alpha (v6.0.0-alpha.18) on macOS 10.12.4\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-alpha (v6.0.0-alpha.18) on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.14393)\r\n```\r\n",
