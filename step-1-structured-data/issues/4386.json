  "body": "Good evening\r\n\r\nit's really hard to complain this issue because it's a discussion about the most basic design principles we know and love snce many years:\r\n\r\nFunctions (in PowerShell commands) should never do things which the user does not expect. \r\nSuch things are well known as side-effects and we had to fight with them 20 years ago as Spaghetti code was widely used.\r\n\r\nTherefore it hurts to see that those Problems are comming back.\r\n\r\n**The concrete problem:**\r\nJoin-Path does no longer solve the problem which we expect (join path items), \r\nbut it also checks if a drive exists.\r\n\r\nThe essence behind this \"logic\" is that _no one is joining path items with non existing drive letters_. Of course, this is wrong.\r\nBut to get a consitent logic, the next version of Join-Path must automatically create any non-exsting path - it's the same logic: _no one is joining path items with a non existing path_.\r\n\r\n**Beside the inconsistent logic, we have more *very* annoying side effects:**\r\n- Existing Code no longer works\r\n- Users are searching for functions which are solvong the problem to join path items\r\n- If someone is writing a function which is just joining path items - how should it get called? \r\nJoin-Path-Without-Test?\r\nmaybe Just-Join-Path?\r\nOf course, it must be called Join-Path.\r\n\r\n**There are many better options to handle the Problem, for example:**\r\n- Add a Parameter (e.g. -AssertDrive and -EnforceDir), but don't change the default logic because it is already perfect\r\n- Create another function, e.g. Join-Path-Assert\r\n- Pass the result of Join-Path to a function which is testing if the drive exists\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nThomas\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# If the Drive Q: does not exists:\r\nPS C:\\Users\\schittli> Join-Path 'q:\\' 'test'\r\nJoin-Path : Cannot find drive. A drive with the name 'q' does not exist.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nJoin-Path ist doing what we expect: join path Elements. Nothing else.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nJoin-Path has an enforced side-effect and it does break the separation of concerns design principle\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.14393.1480\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.14393.1480\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```\r\n",

A drive with the name 'Y' does not exist.`\r\n\r\nSince this is in both editions (correct me if I'm wrong) there would be a breaking change if `Join-Path` suddenly didn't throw an error. So a parameter to override that behavior could be added which would tell `Join-Path` not to validate a rooted path. User could then instead accomplished that with `Resolve-Path`. \r\n\r\n***Note:** Didn't  have a Windows PowerShell 5.1.14393 to test with.*",

      "body": "@johlju thanks for the data.  However, some of the discussion above implies that this behavior of checking if the path is valid is a regression from previous behavior and I'm trying to understand which version of PowerShell had the different behavior.  Trying to understand if the discussion is putting behavior back to what it was or requesting a breaking change.  This is why I suggested above to perhaps use `-Force` (or perhaps more specifically something like `-NoValidate`) to enable the new desired behavior without a breaking change.",

But, after where the exception is thrown, there is logic to check for a null drive. This along with the comment about ignoring the result indicates to me that this should be wrapped in a try/catch. If I'm interpreting this right, it seems the intent was to just use the `GetProvderPath()` to try to get the provider and drive if possible, If not, it falls back to the current provider and drive.\r\n\r\nI propose that `Globber.GetProviderPath()` be wrapped in a throwaway try/catch",
