  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThis is opened in response to negativity around experimental features and only having opt-in functionality.\r\n\r\nAs the title says, this tracks the idea of having all experimental features turned on in the Preview version of PowerShell to provide experimental feature authors the ability to get feedback on newly added experimental features.\r\n\r\nThere may be exceptions to this rule on experimental features that are drastic but It\u2019s the role of a maintainer of PowerShell/PowerShell committee to decide this.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nFor preview builds - experimental features are all on\r\nFor stable builds - experimental features are all off\r\n\r\ncc @SteveL-MSFT @joeyaiello ",
