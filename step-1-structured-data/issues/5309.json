      "body": "@DarwinJS Thanks for bringing this up. I did a quick search of `\"master/tools/download.sh\"` on Github (here is the [result](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=%22master%2Ftools%2Fdownload.sh%22&type=Code&utf8=%E2%9C%93)). Some of the occurrences are from forks of powershell repository. For the rest, I have opened issues in each of those repositories to ask them to replace `download.sh` with `install-powershell.sh`.",

      "body": "@daxian-dbw - on my last comment I forgot to say thanks a lot - I struggled trying to fix this with regular package manager commands and had to move on to other things.\r\n(Sidenote: check out http://install-powershell.sh and the forwarded domain http://pwsh.io)\r\n\r\nMy intent in building install-powershell.sh was to allow the super easy installation of powershell core to add jet fuel to adoption.\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n1. Installing it on one's workstation to get a feel for developing with it (hence the -includeide switch) and\r\n2. Installing it on regular servers (hence default behavior mimics download.sh)\r\n3. Using the install scripts offline (hence install-powershell.sh checks locally for sub-scripts).\r\n\r\nFYI: I didn't even learn it was used to install for CI testing until much later.\r\n\r\nI was also thinking that there was probably many who took a direct dependency on download.sh to get rid of all the hassles of figuring out their platform specific install procedure and then keeping up to date.\r\n\r\nAlthough I don't think this project should feel a contractual obligation to not break that, I also feel that managing it with the sensitivity that people probably do take a dependency on it helps fuel adoption.\r\n\r\nSo rather than retire it because it seems redundant, I would advise changing its contents to:\r\n\r\n```\r\nbash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/tools/install-powershell.sh)\r\n```",
