  "body": "I think this logic was originally added with the assumption that any hostname with a dot in it was an FQDN. I believe this is incorrect. The hostname is the hostname regardless of included dots, and getting the FQDN amounts to always querying for the canonical name.\n\n@daxian-dbw I think this is the rest of the fix for the bug we ran into on launch day. The current was still buggy for me when I had a machine whose _hostname_ was `localhost.localdomain`.\n",
