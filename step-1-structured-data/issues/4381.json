  "body": "<sup>Related: #4199</sup>\r\n\r\nCurrently, using `powershell -version <version>` may or may not be honored:\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell Core:\r\n  * on _Unix_, _any_ version number is accepted, and _quietly falls back to the current version_.\r\n  * on _Windows_,  the behavior is the same as in _Windows PowerShell_ v5.1 (see below).\r\n\r\nIn _Windows_ PowerShell:\r\n * Higher-than-the installed-version numbers are rejected (`Cannot start Windows PowerShell. No version of Windows PowerShell compatible to <version> is installed.`), \r\n  * Lower version numbers may or may not get honored (e.g., on a W10 system `powershell v2` actually starts v2, whereas `powershell v3`, `powershell v4`, and `powershell v5.0` quietly  fall back to v5.1) , and the only way to verify is to inspect `$PSVersionTable` inside the new session.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOn Unix:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\npowershell -version 22.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n* With versions _higher_ than the highest available one: An error complaining that no such version is available, as currently on Windows.\r\n\r\n* With version _lower_ than the highest available one, yet without the _specific_ requested one present, the expected behavior is debatable, but, if a new session is still started, at the very least there should be _some_ indication that the version being launched is not the one _specifically requested_.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nOn Unix, _quietly_ starts the most recently installed version, no matter what version was requested.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on macOS 10.12.5\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.15063.413 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\n```\r\n",
