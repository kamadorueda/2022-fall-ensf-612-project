      "body": "The inconsistency happens when calling the PowerShell CLI from within PowerShell, but not otherwise (calling from `cmd` or `bash` for example). It's good to have a consistent behavior, but it would be a breaking change. And it's likely not in bucket 3 because the chance for either behavior (deserializing to PSObject or returning text) to be depended on in some scripts is relatively high.\r\n\r\nThe Engine working group discussed this today. Given the consideration above, we decide to resolve this issue as `Won't Fix`, unless it's proven causing problems in real world scenarios.",

Pwsh.exe does not work as stated in the docs.\r\n```\r\nThe value of Command can be \"-\", a script block, or a string. \r\nIf the value  of Command is \"-\", the command text is read from standard input.\r\n```\r\nand\r\n\r\n```text \r\n    When called from within an existing PowerShell session, the results are\r\n    returned to the parent shell as deserialized XML objects, not live objects.\r\n    For other shells, the results are returned as strings.\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould a parameter be added to force a behaviour? I really want the serialization behaviour between powershell sessions, but it seems to be impossible in some of the scenarios (like commands on pipeline input)\r\n\r\n",
