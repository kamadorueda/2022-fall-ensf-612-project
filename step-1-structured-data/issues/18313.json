  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis has been happening for over a year through multiple versions of ubuntu and pwsh.\r\n\r\n1. In Windows, clone a GH repo with a PowerShell module to C:\\github\r\n1. Install Ubuntu 20.04 on WSL\r\n1. Install pwsh (this has been happening for over a year)\r\n1. run pwsh\r\n1. cd /mnt/c/github\r\n1. Import-Module ./themodulepath -Force\r\n1. Run a command from that module or maybe wait like a minute, not sure what triggers it\r\n1. Files from loaded PowerShell modules imported in /mnt/c are deleted forever\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nFiles remain\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nFiles are deleted forever\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNone\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.6\r\nOS                             Linux 5.10.102.1-microsoft-standa\u2026\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\nThe reason I filed this here and not WSL is because it _seems_ linked to PowerShell + WSL in some way? Note how the discordrpc module is not messed with. But the two modules I loaded are deleted. I have not observed any files on the native file system being deleted.\r\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8278033/196147494-722e67cf-ac24-4d3b-8c4c-74a35730f92e.mp4\r\n\r\n",

OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH this has got to be a path problem with our module! Thanks for reading!",
