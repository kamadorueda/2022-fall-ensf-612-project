  "body": "Get-Help can display both locally cached help files and online resources.\r\nSince online resources do not require prerequisites like Update-Help and are always up-to-date, and since online resources are much better formatted and include navigation to discover related items, a \"Copy\" button to copy&paste sample code, and more, many users default to using online help, i.e. by adding this to their profile:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$PSDefaultParameterValues.Add(\"Get-Help:Online\",$true)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, without any prerequisites, users can easily display cmdlet help in an extra window like so:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ndir -?\r\nGet-Process -?\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, Get-Help -Online can only show help topics with a dedicated URI property. That's why all about_... topics fail to display even though there are online versions available.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nhelp Get-process -Online # works\r\nhelp about_for -Online #fails\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nWhen Get-Help is used with -Online, it should detect whether the requested help starts with about_ and then construct the appropriate URI rather than fail. This could be done with a hard-coded topic list to include only the MSFT about_ topics, or simply done heuristically with the potential of failing for about topics from 3rd party.\r\n\r\nIf all else fails and there is no match, Get-Help -Online should default to the PowerShell documentation home page: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core  This would enable users to try and search there rather than being left with a red exception.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nGet-Help about_for -Online # should open https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_for\r\nGet-Help about_doesnotexist -Online # should open https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nGet-Help -Online fails for any topic that has no distinct URI property\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u00d4\u00c7\u00aa}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
