  "body": "`Get-Content -ReadCount 0` is a convenient way to request that all lines be read _at once, into an array_ and to have that array be output _as a single_ object to the success stream.\r\nIf the intent is to read all lines into memory anyway, this can greatly speed up the command.\r\n\r\n`-TotalCount <n>` allows you to limit the overall number of lines to be read from the file to a given number.\r\n\r\nIt's reasonable to expect that `-ReadCount 0` also respects that number and therefore returns an `<n>`-element array.\r\n\r\nCurrently, `-ReadCount 0` effectively _ignores_ `-TotalCount` and always returns _all_ lines in the file as an array.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, a specific number - e.g, `-ReadCount 2` to read the file as a stream of 2-element arrays - _does_ respect `-TotalCount`.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n1..10 > temp:/$pid.txt\r\n\r\n(Get-Content temp:/$pid.txt -TotalCount 3 -ReadCount 0).Count | Should -Be 3\r\n\r\nRemove-Item temp:/$pid.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected 3, but got 10.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, all 10 lines were read, even though only 3 were requested with `-TotalCount`\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.4\r\n```\r\n",
