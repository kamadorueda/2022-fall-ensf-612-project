The `B:` entry is an odd one, wonder where that cropped up from?\r\n\r\nIn any case, even the ones that might be useful here should probably end up at the bottom of the tab complete list, below any PowerShell commands (I notice Pester's BeforeAll is somewhere in the middle of the list, below several of the extraneous entries, for example).",
