      "body": "We've talked about this in the past. My only reservation here is that many module authors won't know that they are actually compatible (or mostly compatible) with macOS or Linux, and I'd rather not _prevent_ users from installing those modules. (E.g. posh-git is 99% working on Mac/Linux)\n\nMaybe we should offer a warning at install time if compatibility isn't explicitly listed? \n\nI also agree we should absolutely give users a way to explicitly filter by Edition. \n",
