      "body": "Hi @adaviel!\r\n\r\nThe [MSOnline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/msonline/?view=azureadps-1.0) is the older module for managing Azure AD. The newer module is [AzureAD](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Azuread/?view=azureadps-2.0). Neither module is supported on Linux platforms. They are currently only supported by Windows PowerShell 5.1 on Windows Platforms.\r\n\r\nIn the future, those modules may be made available in PowerShell Core and on Linux, but for the time being they are not supported on linux.",

      "body": "Correct. if you could download and install them they would still not function on Linux. I believe the AzureAD Module doesn't work on PowerShell Core on windows either due to it's reliance on ADAL which requires WinForms. \r\n\r\nThere are quite  a few modules that will work with Core and on Linux. You could try some from the [PowerShellGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/items?q=Tags%3A%22PSEdition_Core%22) just to eliminate if it is something related to installations.",

Earlier, somehow in my playing around I did get MSOnline downloaded into the local modules directory - not sure how - but it did not show in Get-Module until I renamed it from MSOnline.1.1.166.0/ to just MSOnline/. Same with a utility \"PsGet\" I found online - the instructions said that PsGet.psm1 would work if placed in the Modules directory, but it had to be in a PsGet subdirectory.\r\n\r\n",
