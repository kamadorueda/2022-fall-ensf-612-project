We could have chosen a different parameter but we did not. Some people will complain that it doesn't mean the right thing to them. That's fine. No matter what we choose, this will always be the case because different people have different perspectives. In PowerShell we try to choose a single term and apply it consistently so that, even if it does not seem intuitive to a person, they only have to learn it once. Sometimes we choose a sub-optimal term but we live with it because you should only have to learn something once.  Very rarely, we try and \"fix\" things like we did with `$_` and `$PSItem`. This sounded good because new users didn't \"get\" `$_`. So we added `$PSItem` as being easier to understand. The feedback we received from people who teach PowerShell is that rather than helping, having to teach two terms made it worse/more confusing for people trying to learn PowerShell.",
