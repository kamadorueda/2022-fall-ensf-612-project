  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nFor compatibility with Bash, and Linux CLI commands I recommend supporting `--option` style for augments when the specified `option` exactly matches the parameter name. This should not conflict with the way powershell currently parses arguments.\r\n\r\nFor example, `ls --directory` currently fails with an error. This proposal is to allow this command since `directory` parameter exactly matches the parameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "There's nothing stopping you from using `--option` style parameters when using command-line applications, if they support that style of option. In my opinion, it's unlikely PowerShell is going to change its parameter styling to match, though.\r\n\r\nIf you're running on Linux where there _is_ an actual `ls` executable, that would work as expected afaik. On Windows that is an alias that maps to `Get-ChildItem` and as such is bound by PowerShell's rules instead.",
