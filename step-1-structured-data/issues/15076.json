      "body": "Good point, @vexx32, but note that alias `-d` for `-Directory` doesn't actually work and will be removed - see #14700; prefix matching with `-di` works, however.\r\n\r\n@UnkleUnkle, for listing _directories_, @vexx32's solution is the best approach (your command would also include _files_ that happen to have _no filename extension_), but just to explain your symptom:\r\n\r\nThe fundamental problem is that in `cmd.exe` and in the WinAPI file-enumeration APIs wildcard expressions have special behavior built in that _PowerShell_'s [wildcard expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_Wildcards) do not.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get the same behavior as in `cmd.exe`, use the `-Filter` parameter rather than the (positionally implied) `-Path` parameter (the latter uses only PowerShell's wildcards):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ngci -Filter *.  # by contrast `dir *.` is the same as  `gci -Path *.` and therefore `Get-ChildItem -Path *.`\r\n```\r\n\r\n(I've used alias `gci` for [`Get-ChildItem`](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-childitem), because using the alias `dir` can cause confusion, notably the expectation that everything works as in `cmd.exe`\r\nYou can shorten `-Filter` to `-fi`, which is the shortest prefix that unambiguously identifies the `-Filter` parameter; generally, aliases and parameter-name prefixes should only be used interactively, not in scripts).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for why PowerShell's wildcard expressions behave differently: they are not specific to matching _file names_, but are used pervasively throughout PowerShell and therefore match any input string as-is, without making assumptions about a `.` being special, for instance.\r\n\r\nTherefore, wildcard `*.` matches any string that _ends in a verbatim `.`_, which file names generally don't do.\r\nE.g., `'foo' -like '*.'` is `$false`, whereas `'foo.' -like '*.'` and `'.' -like '*.'` are `$true`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Very good explanation of how and why it does this, and I'll go ahead and close the issue  I wouldn't be surprised if others open issues about this later, and personally I think that when PowerShell uses older cmd/dos style commands, it should try to emulate its output rather than just alias a standard PowerShell command.",
