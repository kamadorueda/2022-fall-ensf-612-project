  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIn #18308 we found that running `cd\\` will do different things depending on the operating system. \r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n1. Navigate to any directory above your drive's root level. >  `Set-Location Drive:/LizardPhotos/Skinks`\r\n2. Run `Set-Location \\` or `cd\\`\r\n3. You should now be at your drive's root on windows, or your filesystem root on Linux & Mac.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nWindows, Mac, and Linux set location as the root of the current drive on`cd\\`\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nWindows sets location to the root of the current drive.\r\nMac and Linux sets location to the filesystem root.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nN/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.3.0-preview.9\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.3.0-preview.9\r\nOS                             Microsoft Wind\u2026\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0\u2026\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19718175/196591327-79448a02-1587-4a5d-a0cf-cbd6b73e77df.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19718175/196592137-b7cd63c4-1250-407b-b70b-a244bfc6ebd7.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19718175/196592079-eccd14c6-5199-43ef-8d3d-f20c022c1478.png)\r\n",
