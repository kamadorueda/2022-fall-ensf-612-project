To reproduce the behavior, simply use $Input more than once in a process block.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Test-PipelineInput\r\n{\r\n    process\r\n    {\r\n        Get-Item $Input\r\n        Get-Item $_\r\n        Get-Item $PSItem\r\n\r\n        Write-Host \"\r\n        `$_ is $_\r\n        `$PSItem is $PSItem\r\n        `$Input is $Input\r\n        \"        \r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n'/' | Test-PipelineInput\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nI would expect that the value of $Input is preserved, as is the value of $_ (and its alias).\r\n\r\n```none\r\n    Directory:\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd--hs-        12/30/2018 12:22 PM                C:\\\r\nd--hs-        12/30/2018 12:22 PM                C:\\\r\nd--hs-        12/30/2018 12:22 PM                C:\\\r\n\r\n        $_ is /\r\n        $PSItem is /\r\n        $Input is /\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell Core 6.1 and 6.2-preview.2 as well as Windows PowerShell, $Input is cleared once it has been accessed in any way.\r\n\r\n```none\r\n    Directory:\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd--hs-        12/30/2018 12:22 PM                C:\\\r\nd--hs-        12/30/2018 12:22 PM                C:\\\r\nd--hs-        12/30/2018 12:22 PM                C:\\\r\n\r\n        $_ is /\r\n        $PSItem is /\r\n        $Input is\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\nTested with 5.1 and 6.1 as well.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0-preview.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0-preview.2-34-g6e523f21ebf6c6db02c6990481c737ccee693f8e\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Looking at the documentation, it says something interesting: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_automatic_variables?view=powershell-6#input\r\n\r\n>In the Process block of a function, the $input variable enumerates the object that is currently in the pipeline. When the Process block completes, there are no objects left in the pipeline, so the $input variable enumerates an empty collection.\r\n\r\nThis wording is a bit unclear, but it _seems_ to be saying that `$Input` isn't a static value, even in the `process {}` block. Looking at how it's written, it looks a bit like `$Input` is defined as `$PipelineEnumerator.MoveNext()`, which would offer some explanation as to why it can only be accessed once.\r\n\r\nI've never really seen `$Input` used outside the `end {}` block of a function, so I'm not sure how its behaviour is meant to be defined in `process {}` itself. Good catch, this is a very odd one indeed.\r\n\r\nEDIT: The folks in the PowerShell Slack & Discord point out that this is probably by design (and thus _really_ needs to be better documented) as mentioned here: https://www.red-gate.com/simple-talk/dotnet/.net-tools/down-the-rabbit-hole--a-study-in-powershell-pipelines,-functions,-and-parameters/#tenth\r\n\r\nIn other words, it's designed to be _consumed_, such that when you reach the `end {}` block you can either consume the leftovers if you skipped any for whatever reason, or just process everything in the end block instead. Accessing it in `process {}` effectively consumes that item so that there isn't any duplication.",
