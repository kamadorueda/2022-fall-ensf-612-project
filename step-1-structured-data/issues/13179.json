That said even if you do copy the `Type` object over, classes are tied to their origin runspace.  Using them in another runspace can cause some major issues (see #12801).",

Ok so basically because it is a custom class that doesn't exist across run spaces and I have to redefine it every time it won't work and the practice in of itself is a bad idea. Is this is a limitation of PowerShell classes?",
