Before, I didn't that Screen installed and when I typed Screen nothing happen (no errors).  \n\nSo, after I installed Screen, I thought the behavior of [screen is terminating] within PowerShell was correct.  Now, I can use Screen within PowerShell.  Is cool to go back and forth with it.  \n\n:)\n",
