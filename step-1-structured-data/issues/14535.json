      "body": "Thanks, everyone. I resolved the issue. Problem was that installing 7.1 either from MSI or through Store was not overwriting the 7.0.3, and was also not Installing 7.1 side by side in any way. The 7.0.3 was also not visible in Add/Remove programs or in Choco or in Store. Since it was not visible (7.0.3), could not even uninstall it through any Uninstallers.\r\n\r\nSome unknown Issue caused this somehow. \r\n\r\nI had to go into the C:\\Program Files and manually delete the PowerShell folder. Then I had to Install 7.1 from MS Store, which Installed fine this time. The preview version is also through MS Store only, which shows up fine. Now there is no 7.0.3 in my system.\r\n\r\nNote: Not sure Choco has both pwsh and powershell-core packages. They are the same but cause confusion.",
