Fix is to move the setting of pipeline failure to the block only if the error record is not from a native command.\r\n\r\nThis is an addition to Experimental Feature `PSNotApplyErrorActionToStderr`.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nFix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13393\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [x] Experimental feature name(s): `PSNotApplyErrorActionToStderr`\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] Issue filed: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/6466\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
