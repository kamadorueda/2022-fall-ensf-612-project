CodeFactor suggests fixes in files and around where your changes are already made, primarily, and quietly ignores the other pre-existing issues in its PR reviews.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, sometimes the best thing you can do is shrug and call it \"good enough for now\" until you have the time to do a full pass on each problematic file; probably each full-file style fix should be a separate PR to make it easier on the guys doing the detailed reviews. \ud83d\ude04 ",
