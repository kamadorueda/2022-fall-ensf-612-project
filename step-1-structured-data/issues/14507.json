  "body": "The module `New-ModuleManifest` doesn't allow the user to produce a file without any comments in it. This offers some limitations in term of CI integration scenarios where you would want to produce the manifest automatically (without it having extra options commented out) and also forces users who don't want those comments in their manifests to manually delete them after the creation.\r\n\r\nA simple switch in the `New-ModuleManifest` called `NoComments` to create a file without those comments would give the users more flexibility in terms of using the `New-ModuleManifest`. \r\n\r\nAn example of the command:\r\n````\r\n$settings = @{\r\n Path = \".\\manifest.psd1\";\r\n RootModule = \".\\module.dll\";\r\n}\r\nNew-ModuleManifest @settings -NoComments\r\n````",
