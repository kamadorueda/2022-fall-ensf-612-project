And I'd prefer to see one commit per \"kind\" of change, say replace tabs, or fix file encoding, or add/remove newlines.\r\n\r\nThe newline at the end is an annoying issue - some tools expect a newline on the last line (like `wc` and `git`), whereas a human reader, a blank line at the end needlessly takes up space on the screen, so I naturally delete it.\r\n\r\nSo my point here is - unless we have a pre-commit hook, it's a battle we can't win.",
