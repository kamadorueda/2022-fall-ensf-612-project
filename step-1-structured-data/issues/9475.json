  "body": "Note: This seems to affect all file-creating cmdlets - including `>` and `>>` - with the laudable exception of `Set-Content` and `Add-Content`.\r\n\r\nConceptually related: #7999\r\n\r\nSay you want to create a file literally named `file[1].txt`.\r\n\r\nIn order to successfully pass this name to a `-Path` parameter (or `-FilePath` for `-OutFile`), it must be escaped as `` file`[1`].txt ``, because `-Path` parameters interpret their arguments as wildcard expressions.\r\n\r\nWhile such an escaped path is _accepted_, the problem is that _it isn't retranslated into its literal equivalent on file creation_, resulting in the _escaped_ representation being used as the filename; in the example above, you end up with a file literally named `` file`[1`].txt `` instead of the intended `` file[1].txt ``\r\n\r\nThis problem can generally be avoided by passing the filename to the `-LiteralPath` parameter instead, but that is not yet always an option - see #3174 - and, of course, the bug is worth fixing either way.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the following Pester tests:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nDescribe '-Path file-creation test' {\r\n  BeforeAll { Push-Location TestDrive:\\ }\r\n  AfterAll { Pop-Location }\r\n  It \"Escaped wildcard paths are created as their literal equivalents\" {\r\n   'hi' | Out-File -FilePath 'file`[1`].txt'\r\n    Test-Path -LiteralPath 'file[1].txt' | Should -Be $true\r\n    Test-Path -LiteralPath 'file`[1`].txt' | Should -Be $false\r\n }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe tests fail, because the actual name of the file created is literally `` file`[1`].txt ``, i.e., the _escaped_ name.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 6.2.0 / Windows PowerShell v5.1\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Agreed re consistency, @kwkam.\r\n\r\nThe larger issue, however, is that _output_ file paths should never have been treated as wildcards to begin with, which takes us back to #4726, #6729, and also #9225\r\n\r\nP.S.: The `-FilePath` parameters already are aliased to `-Path`:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nCommand           Name                   Aliases\r\n-------           ----                   -------\r\nExport-FormatData Path                   {FilePath}\r\nInvoke-Command    FilePath               {PSPath}\r\nOut-File          FilePath               {Path}\r\nSet-TraceSource   FilePath               {PSPath, Path}\r\nStart-Process     FilePath               {PSPath, Path}\r\nTee-Object        FilePath               {Path}\r\nTrace-Command     FilePath               {PSPath, Path}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that `PSPath` is yet another alias for some of them, which is also problematic, because `PSPath` should be the alias of `-LiteralPath`, to ensure treatment of pipeline input from, e.g., `Get-ChildItem` as the literal paths that they are.\r\n",

      "body": "@PowerShell/powershell-committee reviewed this.  The case we believe is inconsistent is `out-file file``[1``].txt` where you would properly expect this to be treated as literal as you are escaping the escape character.  Looking at the traces, the parser unescapes it once and the parameter binder is sending ``file`[1`].txt`` to the cmdlet.  The cmdlet calls into the FileSystemProvider which receives this but as it's processing the path, during normalization it appears it gets unescaped to just `file[1].txt` and later the code sees this as a valid wildcard pattern and does globbing.\r\n\r\nGiven that the current FileSystemProvider is sensitive to changes, we recommend that this scenario be addressed in FileSystemProvider v2 rather than trying to fix this in v1 and risk regression.",
