In an non-maximized instance of Windows Terminal, the path consumes most of the space, especially if opened several directories deep into the wsl user profile. There's no space left on the line for a full word in that case. Instead it should show as `PS \\\\wsl$\\distroname\\home\\username\\whatever` (and consolidate to `...` for really long paths showing only the last 2 linux directories)",
