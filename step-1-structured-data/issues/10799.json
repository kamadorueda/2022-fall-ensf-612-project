  "body": "https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/10338 removed the `ScriptDebugger.SetBreakpoints()` API, allowing .NET code to set breakpoints.\r\n\r\nAlthough previous PowerShells didn't have a convenient way to create a breakpoint object, removing this API means there's no way to avoid reflection when setting a breakpoint in a PowerShell module targeting anything prior to PS 7.\r\n\r\nThis is an issue for PowerShellEditorServices, where good debugging APIs are already scarce. A break like this will crash PSES unexpectedly (since PSStandard doesn't pick it up) and the only fix is to use reflection to find the right call at runtime (nullifying the reason to use PSStandard).",

If the caller is expecting their breakpoint to be the one registered in the debugger, with referential equality intact, that may mean we need to use a different call path.",
