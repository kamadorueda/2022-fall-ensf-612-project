  "body": "closes #5112\r\n\r\n* Adds an error when a user tries to use `-Credential` (legacy usage without `-Authentication`) or `-UseDefaultCredentials` over a non-HTTPS URI\r\n* User can Bypass error with `-AllowUnencryptedAuthentication`\r\n* `-UseDefaultCredentials` can only be reliably tested on Windows as support on other platforms depends on a kerberos infrastructure. \r\n* Adds `/Auth/` tests to WebListener for challenge authentication Basic, Negotiate, and NTLM\r\n\r\nIncidentally, this increases test coverage for the web cmdlets as `-Credential` and `-UseDefaultCredentials` were not being tested.",
