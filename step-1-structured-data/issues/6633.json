  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nClean up 'GetTypeInfo()' calls in 'help', 'cimSupport' and 'DscSupport' folders.\r\n\r\n`GetTypeInfo()` were added when porting PowerShell to early version of .NET Core (prior .NET Core 1.0).\r\nMost properties and methods in `System.Type` were missing at that time. Now the call is not needed anymore and should be removed.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [x] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
