  "body": "The GetCurrentConsoleFontEx() api is available, but fails with unspecified error code on ServerCore running in container.  Using similar logic to NanoServer where the api is not available, don't make the error fatal.  Ignore the error so PSReadline continues to work.  Impact is if using ServerCore on non-English (double char wide) characters.\r\n\r\nFix #3927 ",
