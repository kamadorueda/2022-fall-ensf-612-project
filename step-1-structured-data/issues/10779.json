      "body": "Thank you for your reply. Yet I still don't understand why arbitrary messages in the shell are justified.\r\n\r\n - I don't know what PSCore is and I don't care. I want to get some work done and could do without the distractions. What gives you the right to decide on what I direct my attention to? \r\n - If the adoption of PSCore is low, how is that suddenly my problem?\r\n - If the adoption of PSCore is low, and it is an 100% equivalent update of my powershell, i.e. it does exactly what PS does without me ever knowing, why do you not just update powershell with the next Windows update, so that I don't even notice?\r\n - The big thing with PSCore seem to be that it is \"platform independent\", i.e. it is available for linux and Mac. Why do you push ads to a Windows shell then? Wouldn't it make more sense to ask Canonical to run the add in the Message of the Day (motd) in Ubuntu Terminals? \r\n - As a developer, I am interested and excited about software, and I am really happy for the changes that the Core mentality brings, but why do I have to care about that everywhere? If Adobe were to implement Lightroom to run with magic pixies in the background, I still wouldn't care as long as it would help me archive my pictures. \r\n\r\nAs for your argument that showing links is justified because it worked: I'd like to see some p-value & effect size on that statement. \r\n\r\nAnd Finally: I am not part of a PS Community, I am was unaware of PowerShell Core, but I sure am aware of it now. Also, I will make sure to use something else instead. Past behavior is the best predictor for future behavior, so I am pretty certain that PSCore will not respect my desire to be left alone; or even my privacy. Let me guess, big \"Telemetry\" comming up to help \"improve\" my \"experience\"?\r\n\r\n",
