The Exception type is useful information and this change doesn't require the user to explore the error object to get it.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> 1/0\r\nRuntimeException: Attempted to divide by zero.\r\nPS> gerr\r\n\r\nException             :\r\n    ExceptionType  : System.Management.Automation.RuntimeException\r\n    ErrorRecord    :\r\n        Exception             :\r\n            ExceptionType : System.Management.Automation.ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n            Message       : Attempted to divide by zero.\r\n            HResult       : -2146233087\r\n        CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n        FullyQualifiedErrorId : RuntimeException\r\n        InvocationInfo        :\r\n            ScriptLineNumber : 1\r\n            OffsetInLine     : 1\r\n            HistoryId        : -1\r\n            Line             : 1/0\r\n            PositionMessage  : At line:1 char:1\r\n                               + 1/0\r\n                               + ~~~\r\n            CommandOrigin    : Internal\r\n        ScriptStackTrace      : at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 1\r\n    TargetSite     :\r\n        Name          : Divide\r\n        DeclaringType : System.Management.Automation.IntOps\r\n        MemberType    : Method\r\n        Module        : System.Management.Automation.dll\r\n    StackTrace     :\r\n   at System.Management.Automation.IntOps.Divide(Int32 lhs, Int32 rhs) in /Users/steve/repos/PowerShell/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/Operations/NumericOps.cs:line 61\r\n   at System.Dynamic.UpdateDelegates.UpdateAndExecute2[T0,T1,TRet](CallSite site, T0 arg0, T1 arg1)\r\n   at System.Management.Automation.Interpreter.DynamicInstruction`3.Run(InterpretedFrame frame) in /Users/steve/repos/PowerShell/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/interpreter/DynamicInstructions.Generated.cs:line 166\r\n   at System.Management.Automation.Interpreter.EnterTryCatchFinallyInstruction.Run(InterpretedFrame frame) in /Users/steve/repos/PowerShell/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/interpreter/ControlFlowInstructions.cs:line 357\r\n    Message        : Attempted to divide by zero.\r\n    Data           : System.Collections.ListDictionaryInternal\r\n    InnerException :\r\n        ExceptionType : System.DivideByZeroException\r\n        Message       : Attempted to divide by zero.\r\n        HResult       : -2147352558\r\n    Source         : System.Management.Automation\r\n    HResult        : -2146233087\r\nCategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], RuntimeException\r\nFullyQualifiedErrorId : RuntimeException\r\nInvocationInfo        :\r\n    ScriptLineNumber : 1\r\n    OffsetInLine     : 1\r\n    HistoryId        : -1\r\n    Line             : 1/0\r\n    PositionMessage  : At line:1 char:1\r\n                       + 1/0\r\n                       + ~~~\r\n    CommandOrigin    : Internal\r\nScriptStackTrace      : at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    -
