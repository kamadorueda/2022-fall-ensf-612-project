  "body": "This is something that I've come across at quite a few occasions now. Most recently, it was when writing a `GetHashCode` implementation. But also when writing tools for developers/myself I have wanted to do integer arithmetic with overflow/wrapping.\r\nThe only reasonable way I've found was to write it in C# and use `add-type` to access it, but that cannot be our recommendation in the long term.\r\n\r\nI can see this being done in two ways.\r\n\r\n1. By far the simplest: provide class in System.Management.Automation that provides us with this functionality, as part of the Module Writers Toolbox\u2122.\r\n\r\n2. Second, and with much higher effort/expertise involved, is to provide language support for it. I don't have any concrete suggestion for syntax yet.\r\n\r\nThis has come up often enough that I thought it was worth an issue.\r\n",
