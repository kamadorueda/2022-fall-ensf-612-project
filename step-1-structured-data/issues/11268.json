It appears to be being loaded using the new compatibility logic and _acts_ like a native module. \r\n\r\nFrom a help perspective, this module does not seem to exist (for PWSH7) yet its commands do certainly exist.  I would argue that the user is expecting to be able to Get-Help on a directly available command. Even though you may not ship it, it is a module directly accessible from what you do ship thus at least point to the 5.1 help!",
