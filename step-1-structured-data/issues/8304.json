Expanding the window horizontally or vertically increases the buffer and eliminates the exception. If you can't reproduce it, try shrinking the buffer even further in shortcut settings.\r\n\r\n`Remove-Module` does eliminate the exception, but it also eliminates the Emacs-style tab completion.\r\n\r\nWith a larger buffer, you may still be able to reproduce the issue by pressing TAB repeatedly after the hyphen.",
