  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nOMI does not support server certificate validation, so this change is to add a requirement that -SkipCACheck and -SkipCNCheck options are specified before a connection is allowed.  This way users will be aware that no server certificate validation is performed.\r\n\r\nThis **only** applies to PSCore6 remoting clients on non-Windows platforms, when creating a remote session to a Windows machine via WinRM\\OMI.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change because these skip check options are now required.  If the skip check options are not included then the connection will be denied.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```powershell\r\n# On a Linux or MacOS machine\r\nNew-PSSession -Cn <WindowsMachine> -Credential $cred -Authentication Basic -UseSSL\r\nNew-PSSession : HTTPS on Unix does not support CA or CN checks. Use the PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck and -SkipCNCheck if you are certain of the server you are connecting to.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ New-PSSession -cn paulhig-2 -Credential $cred -Authentication Basic - ...\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ResourceUnavailable: (:) [New-PSSession], PSRemotingTransportException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSRemotingDataStructureException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewPSSessionCommand\r\n\r\n$so = New-PSSessionOption -SkipCACheck -SkipCNCheck\r\n$session = New-PSSession -Cn <WindowsMachine> -Credential $cred -Authentication Basic -UseSSL -SessionOption $so\r\n\r\nEnter-PSSession -Cn <WindowsMachine> -Credential $cred -Authentication Basic -UseSSL -SessionOption $so\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] Issue filed - Issue link: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/3299\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
