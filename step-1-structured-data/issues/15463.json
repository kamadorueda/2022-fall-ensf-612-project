Set the display language of system as Eng and UTF-8 for all languages enabled.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71358306/119694704-0d1c9380-be80-11eb-8fa4-731a704b1302.png)\r\nIt seems that I have created a full utf-8 env. But after installation of Oh-My-Posh, I found that special symbols still display as weird boxes or Chinese characters that hardly used.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nIt is supposed to be like pics from Internet:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71358306/119695278-992ebb00-be80-11eb-99f7-e72cecce0999.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71358306/119695440-bfecf180-be80-11eb-9e1f-44d6cb0b3357.png)\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nMy PS7 and PS7-pervierw in Windows Terminal Preview, however, go wrong:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71358306/119695635-f62a7100-be80-11eb-885a-1f94d9f7d41a.png)\r\nSomeone says it's because of fonts. So I have tried many fonts of monospace and for powerline, including Cascadia Code font family, Consolas, Fira Code font family, Hack, Lucida Console, Sarasa Mono font family, Source Code Pro font family, Unispace and so on. None of them help display these symbols correctly. So frustrated I am now...\r\n\r\nAlso, PS7 and PS7-preview independent windows are worse:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71358306/119696748-13137400-be82-11eb-8cc7-ac8abdde0a51.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71358306/119696797-1eff3600-be82-11eb-9f39-dcceb4438adb.png)\r\n\r\n(The font in my screenshots above is Cascadia Code PL.)\r\n\r\nWhen Fira Code:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71358306/119697222-8e752580-be82-11eb-8885-eb38598952e5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0-preview.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0-preview.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for your time reading this issue.
