  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n1. Move the declaration of the variable `PSNativeArgumentPassing` (from an experimental feature) to `static InitialSessionState`, to be consistent with `PSNativeCommandUsesErrorActionPreference`.\r\n2. Change back to `GetBooleanPreference` to get the value for `PSNativeCommandUsesErrorActionPreference`, because when assigning a value to that variable in a nested scope, the variable won't have the argument transformation attribute and thus can be assigned with arbitrary values. Tests are also added.\r\n\r\n    \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/127450/130705227-6c602b6e-a931-43ea-920e-8d08a9f5deeb.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Instead of using the string `\"PSNativeCommandArgumentPassing\"`, use the const variable defined in `ExperimentalFeature`.\r\n4. Instead of using `s_nativeArgumentPassingVarPath`, use the one defined in `SpecialVariables`.\r\n5. A few other simple cleanup changes.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n",
