      "body": "This may be because the () hold a mixture of arguments for the constructor, and properties to be set after the attribute object is created. I can't get ctrl space do display a list of properties in the ISE or in 7 on VSCode unless there is the start of a property name. (e.g. type O in either and \"Options\" is offered). VSCode offers things the editor thinks might be useful but not the property choices.  The first and subsequent properties behave the same way.",

The line has to be complete like this: `[ValidatePattern()]$StringToCheck` then you move the cursor inside the parentheses and press CTRL+Space\r\nHere it is inside the ISE:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42123497/82932486-cbb18980-9f88-11ea-8612-b897a32309b6.png)\r\nHere it is inside the latest Powershell preview version, this time with the cmdletbinding attribute:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/42123497/82932690-19c68d00-9f89-11ea-9009-20e927cdc176.png)\r\n\r\nWriting this comment has made be realize why it doesn't work, adding the comma for the next parameter makes the line invalid and that breaks intellisense, adding a letter makes it valid again but that obviously limits the options offered by intellisense.",

      "body": "Oh, okay, that makes sense to a point.\r\n\r\nPlenty of other things are able to generate completions for things like that where the input is incomplete though, and we should (at least in theory) be able to offer completions for the incomplete input as well (without the trailing `)]`, it's just a matter of figuring out how that gets presented in the parser and updating the completion logic to handle that.",
