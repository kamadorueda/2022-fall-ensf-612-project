'd'\r\nPS> $characters\r\nabcd\r\nPS>$characters[1]\r\nb\r\nPS>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS> [string]$characters = 'a' ..

PowerShell will do this with any array you try to convert to a string like: `[string](\"Hello\",\"World\")`.  \r\nIf you want to create a string with the range operator you need to do it the same way you would with any other char array. One example could be like this: `[string]::new(\"a\"..\"z\")` another would be using the join operator like @237dmitry showed.",

So, it's hard to grasp, without this explanation, what actually happens when the range operator is used (on string).\r\n\r\nDon't expect users to use PowerShell every day and to know the nitty gritties.\r\n\r\nI propose there should as least be a warning note in the documentation, referencing the $OFS preference variable.",

The documentation should tell you what a feature does and how to use a feature, it shouldn't explain all the different ways you can combine the feature with other features to create neat little scripts.",

Regardless if they use a warning box or not I don't think writing about the string conversion behavior makes sense here.  \r\nIf they were to include it here, should they include that in every help page for features that output arrays? Should they include information about other array conversion tips? It makes more sense to have a general array or type conversion topic so people that want to understand why this works: `\"Hello\",\"World\"` can look it up in a relevant location rather than having it as a random note in an unrelated operator.",
