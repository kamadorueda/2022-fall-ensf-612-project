  "body": "[certificateCommon.psm1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/test/powershell/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.Security/certificateCommon.psm1) contains a self signed certificate used for tests in the `Microsoft.PowerShell.Security`. Other modules will require certificates so this test module should be moved to a common area accessible to all tests.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the certificate  in `New-GoodCertificate` is issued for only the `Key Encipherment`, `Data Encipherment`, and `Document Encryption` key usages. This key cannot be used for tests such as certificate authentication with `Invoke-WebRequest`/`Invoke-RestMethod`. A new self-signed certificate should be issued that includes key usage for all tests that may require it to prevent the need for separate certificates and functions for each key requirement.\r\n\r\nFor more details see #4546",
