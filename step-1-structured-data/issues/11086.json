  "body": "Sometimes you need search a word starting from the end of the file (surely a log file) \r\n\r\nAt Linux you can use standard tac command:\r\n\r\ntac xxxx | filter | tac \r\n\r\nSo you have the tail of the file filtered like you Want. The simple case is when filter is grep -m1 searchedword\r\n\r\nI think Get-content could have -reverse option which would read the file from the finish\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? See https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/dwuz96/large_csv_file/f7ma6g1?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share for a real example\r\n\r\nThank you! ",
