  "body": "This request fixes two items:\n1.  Certain keybindings don't show up properly when one executes \"Get-PSReadlineKeyHandler\".  This is because some of the ConsoleKeyInfo.KeyChar fields were defined with non-viewable characters.  With the recent change to the comparison of ConsoleKeyInfo, to not compare the KeyChar field, we can now modify the Key table to have actualy-viewable characters for KeyChar field.\n2. Some of the tab-related commands sometimes show duplicates as tab-completion choices.  In my testing, I've only seen this with PSReadLine cmdlets, e.g. two choices of Get-PSReadlineKeyHandler. Duplicates happen because PSReadLine cmdlets show up pre-pended with the Module name also. For example, Get-PSReadlineKeyHandler also show up as PSReadLine\\Get-PSReadlineKeyHandler. To eliminate the duplicate, I investigated several options.  Since it looks like the CommandCompletion class does generate duplicates intentionally, I've decided to go the filter route and remove the duplicates myself.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/948)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
