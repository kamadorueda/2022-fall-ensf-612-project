RegisterManifest.ps1, which expected to take a path of this location, does not work with the path because it uses the path for `wevtutil` without quoting it. This results in multiple parameters like  `C:\\Program` `Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.0`, which is invalid for `wevtutil`.\r\n\r\nThis change simply add double quotes when the pass is used for  `wevtutil`.",
