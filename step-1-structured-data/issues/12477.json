  "body": "Hi guys :)\r\n\r\npester is awesome framework to testing code but sometimes we need test code ad-hok and quickly...the idea is to provide a _test based-comment_ . for this we need:\r\n\r\n**1) new commun parameter <switch> for example -testDoc\r\n2) a comment based help with .EXAMPLE section\r\n3) and of course a code to test**\r\n\r\nfor example we assume we have a test-me function\r\n\r\n```\r\n<#\r\n.SYNOPSIS\r\n test-me \r\n.DESCRIPTION\r\n test-me function\r\n.EXAMPLE\r\ntest-me 5 6\r\n11\r\n\r\n.EXAMPLE\r\ntest-me 5\r\n10\r\n\r\n.EXAMPLE\r\ntest-me 4\r\n3\r\n#>\r\nfunction test-me {\r\n  param($a,$b=5)\r\n  $a+$b\r\n} \r\n```\r\n\r\nand then with the new commun switch **-testDoc**\r\n\r\n### result\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS > test-me -testDoc\r\n\r\nFailed Example\r\n    test-me 4\r\nExpected:\r\n    9\r\nGot:\r\n    3\r\n\r\n1 item(s) had failures 1 of 3 \r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nwe can use this technique with functions or scripts that have comments-based-help.\r\n\r\n### what benefits\r\n\r\n1) he will encourage everyone to write good comments and especially good examples\r\n\r\n2) it will help us quickly test our code\r\n\r\n3) it's not a substitute for pestering but another toolkit",
