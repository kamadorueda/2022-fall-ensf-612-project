  "body": "<sup>Follow-up to #3684.</sup>\r\n\r\nWith _multiple_ input objects, the `-NoNewline` switch causes said cmdlets not to place a newline after each (output representation of) the input object - in other words: the input objects' (representations) are _directly concatenated_.\r\n\r\nWhile the usefulness of this behavior is debatable, it should work consistently with respect to how newlines _embedded_ in input object representations are handled.\r\n\r\nCurrently, \r\n\r\n* formatter-generated output representations have their embedded newlines _stripped_\r\n\r\n* `.ToString()` generated output representations have their embedded newlines _preserved.\r\n\r\nIt is the latter behavior that should be consistently applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n([pscustomobject] @{ one = 1 }), \"two`nthree\" | Out-File -NoNewline t.txt; Get-Content -raw t.txt\r\n```\r\nNote how the first input object uses the PS formatting system, whereas the second one doesn't.\r\n\r\nActual behavior:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\none---  1two\r\nthree    # no trailing newline\r\n```\r\nNote how the internal newlines were stripped from the default output formatting for `@{ one = 1 }`, which is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\none\r\n---\r\n  1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior:\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\none\r\n---\r\n  1two\r\nthree  # no trailing newline\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou could argue that `-NoNewline` with formatter-generated output doesn't make much sense with _multiple_ input objects, and the mixing with `.ToString()` formatted objects produces strange effects, but stripping all embedded newlines makes even less sense.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.8\r\n```\r\n",
