  "body": "Note: Fixing this would be a breaking change, but arguably one that falls into [Bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area).\r\n\r\n**Currently, when you use a `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName` parameter attribute, the property named there is only bound when using _pipeline_ input and not also when passing the same object as a direct _argument_.**\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the discrepancy with a simple example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Declare a function with a parameter that binds pipeline input by the value of \r\n# property .LiteralPath or its alias .PSPath\r\nfunction foo { \r\n  param(\r\n   [Parameter(ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName)]\r\n   [Alias('PSPath')]\r\n   [string[]] ${LiteralPath}\r\n  ) \r\n  \"`$LiteralPath: [$LiteralPath]\" \r\n}\r\n\r\n# Create object with a .PSPath property.\r\n$obj = [pscustomobject] @{ PSPath = 'pspath' }\r\n\r\n# Pass the object to the function, first via the pipeline, then as a direct argument\r\n$obj | foo\r\nfoo -LiteralPath $obj\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe output shows that the `.PSPath` property is bound es expected via the pipeline, but _not_ as a direct argument:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n$LiteralPath: [pspath]                       # OK (pipeline): .PsPath value was bound.\r\n$LiteralPath: [@{PSPath=pspath}]  # !! (argument): $obj was simply stringified (.ToString())\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe **binding of the direct _argument_ pays attention only to the parameter _type_**, causing it to simply _stringify_ `$obj` with `.ToString()` (not with default output formatting).\r\n\r\nThis discrepancy is not only surprising, it **can have grave consequences** when dealing with `[System.IO.FileInfo]` instances output by **`Get-ChildItem`**,  because the latter **often stringify to a _mere filename_**, potentially causing unexpected and destructive behavior with `-LiteralPath` cmdlets such as `Remove-Item`, `Move-Item` and `Copy-Item`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create sample file 'tmpFile' in subfolder 'tmpDir'; i.e.: tmpDir/tmpFile\r\n$null > (Join-Path (New-Item -force -Type Directory tmpDir) tmpFile)\r\n\r\n# Obtain a [System.IO.FileInfo] instance representing the new file.\r\n# Note that `Get-ChildItem tmpDir` rather than `Get-Item tmpDir/tmpFile` (or\r\n# `Get-ChildItem tmpDir/tmpFile` is purposely used, because it is only\r\n# `Get-ChildItem` without a filename component in the path that stringifies \r\n#  the resulting instances to their filename only.\r\n$f = Get-ChildItem tmpDir\r\n\r\n# Demonstrate that $f stringies to just 'tmpFile' - the mere filename.\r\n\"`$f stringifies to: [$f]\"\r\n\r\n# Now bind $f to the -LiteralPath parameter as a *direct argument* of \r\n# several cmdlets, which *fails*, because trying to locate the input object\r\n# as a *string* that is the *filename only* fails, given that file is in\r\n# a *subdirectory*.\r\nRemove-Item -WhatIf -LiteralPath $f\r\nMove-Item -WhatIf -LiteralPath $f foo\r\nCopy-Item -WhatIf -LiteralPath $f foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe last 3 calls fail unexpectedly; while this happens not to be destructive / make unexpected changes in this example, it would be the case if namesake files happened to exist in the current location.\r\n\r\n**The fact that whether this problem arises depends on the specific method through which the `[System.IO.FileInfo]`, `[System.IO.DirectoryInfo]` instances were obtained makes this behavior particularly insidious.**\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0 on macOS 10.13.2\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0 on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.15063.674 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\n```\r\n",
