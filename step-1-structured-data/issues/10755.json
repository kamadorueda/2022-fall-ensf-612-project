  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSimply, a Tabbed interface for multiple powershell sessions, instead of separate floating windows. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, I'd like to be able to use a keyboard shortcut like `Ctrl+T` to initiate and focus on a new PowerShell instance. \r\n\r\nLinux Terminals, Mac Terminals, and for Windows we have CMD wrappers like Cmder, Terminator for Windows, and even IntelliJ's console view, have all enabled tabbed interfaces for Command Prompt. \r\n\r\nCMD and the old blue PowerShell could be excused for lacking this feature, but I find it strange and alien feeling to be using a modern iteration and take on PowerShell, but still no tabs. \r\n\r\n\r\nAn example of Cmder's tab interface \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1039911/66522959-7e3ce680-eaa3-11e9-91b3-c7136162c347.png)\r\n",
