  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm working on a [project](https://wiki.freebsd.org/SummerOfCode2018Projects/PortingPowerShellPorting) with Google Summer of Code and the FreeBSD organization to port PowerShell -- as well as the .NET SDK -- to the FreeBSD platform. So far, I've successfully compiled both native (libpsl-native) and managed parts of the PowerShell code on FreeBSD.\r\n\r\nAt first, three libpsl tests were failing: `IsFileTest.RootIsFile`, `GetUserFromPid.Success` and `LocaleTest.Success`. The last one was just a missing `LANG` env variable, so as soon as I set it, the test passed. But the first two ones required code changes, which I'm submitting as a PR with questions I had related to specific lines, but they are now ALL passing.\r\n\r\nHowever, the resulting PowerShell build is misbehaving in some ways and I'd like some guidance as to what I should look for:\r\n\r\n- This is what I'm getting for the shell prompt: `PS Alias:/>`.\r\n- Running any cmdlet gets me a `not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function...` error.\r\n- Typing anything in results in repeated characters. For example, if I type in `Get-Help`, this is what I get: `PS Alias:/> GGeGetGet-Get-HGet-HeGet-HelGet-Help`. Although, as I press Enter, the actual thing that gets read is `Get-Help`, and not the long string with repeated characters.\r\n\r\nThis is what my $PSVersionTable looks like:\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-preview.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.1.0-preview.3-59-ge56a6c4bc9c42ba0d0a4c413f31d4508c7a65b75\r\nOS                             FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE FreeBSD 11.1-RELEASE #0 r321309: Fri Jul 21 02:08:28 UTC 2017   ...\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc @DragonSA @davidchisnall @SteveL-MSFT ",

It was a problem in CoreFX's FileSystem native implementation that was failing in a certain function and the mount points were not being returned.

I'm trying to find out how PS interacts with the console and if there's any echoing involved.",
