  "body": "Not everyone is currently happy with the choice of \"stable\" and \"unstable.\"\n\nPlease review [the documented intent](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/master/docker) of the names, and officially settle on appropriate tags (as it requires code change).\n\nAlso settle on which container will be the \"latest\" container.\n\nAfterward, we need the [Docker Hub registry app](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/github/#github-organizations) to be approved with the PowerShell organization so I can set up automated builds on a PowerShell/PowerShell registry (example setup [on my own user](https://hub.docker.com/r/andschwa/powershell/builds/)).\n\nThis is necessary to resolve #2002.\n\n/cc @PowerShell/powershell-committee \n\nNote: I need to copy the `bootstrap.ps1` files to each unstable Dockerfile folder; while `launch.sh` copies it on the fly, this doesn't work for the automated builds. They each need a copy in the context of the folder itself. Alternatively the Dockerfiles can be renamed and put in one folder, but this is unconventional.\n",

That's easy (unless anyone has objections).\n\nFor the latest build from source in master, the basic principle is that we want to discourage people from picking this over `latest-alpha` because it sounds more stable. We've got a few options here, none of which I'm thrilled about:\n- `latest-master-<platform>`\n- `latest-dev-<platform>`\n- `latest-source-<platform>`\n- `latest-github-<platform>`\n- We can also use an arcane acronym as a way to discourage usage of this tag like `lbfm` for `latest build from master` or `lms` for `latest master source`. \n\n@andschwa : thoughts? \n",

Our general versioning elsewhere in PowerShell is moving toward Semver, which uses the term Stable (& by inference UnStable), as it provides information about the recommended use that's unavailable in Release and Nightly. If we use both, it gives good value. However, without the Stable tag, it seems you are creating a new mechanism for tagging these builds that consumers of them have to interpret independently from Semver. I believe that's not the right approach. \n",
