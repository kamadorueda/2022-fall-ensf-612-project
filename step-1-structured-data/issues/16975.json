      "body": "> isn't it true that the environment variables in windows take effect in time\r\n\r\nIt depends on the app that PowerShell is launched from since PowerShell inherits that environment.  Some apps can listen for system/user environment variable changes and update their environment accordingly.  I thought that File Explorer was an app that did that but perhaps not.  Or given that you're on Windows 11, maybe this is **another** thing they fubar'd in Windows 11.  Either way, this is not an issue with PowerShell.",
