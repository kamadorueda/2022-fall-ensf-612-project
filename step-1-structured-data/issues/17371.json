  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI just moved from powershell 5.x to 7.2 and realized get-wmiobject was replaced by get-ciminstance.   Command output of **Get-CimInstance Win32_ComputerSystem** with **-ComputerName** option returns less data.\r\n\r\n`get-ciminstance -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem -Property *`\r\n\r\nUserName displayed as an available property\r\n\r\n`get-ciminstance -ClassName Win32_Computersystem -ComputerName Computer1 -Property *`\r\n\r\nUserName is not an available property\r\n\r\nI have tried adding Select-Object UserName and Format-Table Username with no success.    I have also tried $session=New-CimInstance -ComputerName Computer1 with and without DCOM option, the trying to using that Cimsession to retrieve value with no success.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

I can go back to PS 5.1 and use gwmi.   I am new to PS 7.x so if there is another way to pull the logged in user of a computer easily please let me know.  I have tried numerous ways and everytime I add the -ComputerName option it always returns blank but if I go to a computer and run (get-ciminstance -Class Win32_OperatingSystem).username it will work fine just not remotely.",
