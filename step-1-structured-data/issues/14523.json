  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIt will be preferred that the suggesting path for `cd` by tapping `tab` could be `/`-style rather than `\\\\`-style. \r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`/` is considered as non-ambiguous when it comes to path expression. Even [the syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp) for `XPath` is also `/`-based, not to mention Linux.\r\n\r\nEvery time I copy the path to the C# as a `const string`, I have to manually replace all `\\\\`. If it is Linux that `PowerShell` hates, I will be cool with that. But when `C#` also considers `\\\\` as an escape sign, then it is inconsistent that `PowerShell`, a C# based cross-platform APP, still sticks to `\\\\`.\r\n",
