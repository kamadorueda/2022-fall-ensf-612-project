  "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI just installed powershell version 6.2.3 on my professional laptop, through a suggestion in vscode telling me that my powershell version was out of date. IT offered me to install, which I did.\r\n\r\nSince then, I noticed none of my modules in ```C:\\program files\\Windowspowershell\\modules\\``` could be loaded anymore.\r\n\r\nHaving a closer look at my env path, this is what I see in vscode:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6302961/65568608-cbc13b80-df5a-11e9-9e51-eb43ad54d9b3.png)\r\n\r\nWe don't have ```C:\\program files\\Windowspowershell\\modules\\``` anymore but ```C:\\program files\\powershell\\modules\\``` instead.\r\n\r\nThis is a breaking change for me.\r\n\r\nAfter a second check, I do have now version 6.2.3 of powershell available in vscode (loaded by default).\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6302961/65568714-117e0400-df5b-11e9-9acc-fed9ab0735ab.png)\r\n\r\nThis is of course not what I wanted.\r\n\r\nI can imagine that that path is missing only because it is powershell core, and that the folder `WindowsPowershell` can't be present on a mac / linux box.\r\n\r\nSo far, I am ok with that.\r\nBut I work on a Windows machine, and that WindowsPowershell path has been there since modules where introduced. \r\n\r\nDid I do something stupid and removed it my self? or is this really part of pscore? If so, why also on a Windows machines? \r\n\r\nAnd how can default back to Windows 5.1 on vscode, because clearly broke a lot of working habits (And reduced once more, the user experience I have with VsCode)",
