Correct me if wrong, but it's definitely on \"the radar\", main obstacle is getting PowerShell to have the same support cadence as .Net 5/Windows which seems to be what's happening with 7.1 right now.\r\n\r\nEdit: In the meantime, it's possible to do yourself as well, Scott Hanselman has a handy [guide](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/TotallyUnsupportedHacksAddWindowsTerminalToTheWinXShortcutMenu.aspx) on how to add the Windows Terminal to the Win+X menu. Should be easy enough to change with Powershell if you're not using Windows Terminal",
