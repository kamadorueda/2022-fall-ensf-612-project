This cmdlet does not guarantee secure connections to SMTP servers. While there is no immediate replacement available in PowerShell, we recommend you do not use Send-MailMessage at this time. See https://aka.ms/SendMailMessage for more information.\r\n\r\nBut the link takes you to a page regarding DotNet, not PowerShell, and it's not clear what command should be used instead as an alternative. And of course the command works.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

The recommended replacement is [MailKit](https://github.com/jstedfast/MailKit) which isn't included in PowerShell. Unless PowerShell wants to ship this library so a new `Send-MailMessage` can utilise it then it can't really do anything.\r\n\r\n> It serves no useful purpose as is.\r\n\r\nIt sort of does, it's saying this may not be secure, be careful what you use it for.",

Sending mail is 101 in coding, and to tell me it's not sure, without providing me an alternative is silly. Also, most mail clients are sending mail unencrypted unless the client/server both support the protocols necessary.\r\n",
