Currently it is sorted with `CurrentCultureIgnoreCase`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/c857392c34613fc8ece1432ceb89a5310d9e5fd9/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L1617-L1618\r\n\r\nHowever, it may be desirable on *nix platforms or on case-sensitive filesystems to make the ordering discern case-sensitivity.",

This is more performant when dealing with large structures as it doesn\u2019t need to collect everything to then sort. If the end user desires it to be sorted they can pipe the output into `Sort-Object` and sort as they wish.",

      "body": "To be clear; we're _already_ sorting this, have been since... probably 6.0. The formatting system currently does not support actual sorting of objects.\r\n\r\nYes, there are performance concerns because of that, most likely. However, it's probably not unreasonable to say that some kind of sorted output is _expected_, especially on MacOS or Linux systems, whose filesystems do not tend to order by default. The `ls` utility sorts by name by default, so I think it's not unreasonable for folks to generally expect that PS's Get-ChildItem does the same.\r\n\r\nConsider also if the formatting system was the only thing doing sorting. Users could `Get-ChildItem`, see the results, try to `Get-ChildItem | Select -First 1` or `$items[0]` and the item they end up with is not the first one they saw in the output. I don't think sorting in formatting is the answer here, it only leads to more confusion.\r\n\r\nIt you call `[System.IO.Directory]::EnumerateFileSystemEntries($path)` on Mac/Linux from PS, you can see what I mean. There is essentially no intrinsic ordering at all, so if we didn't order things it would be a complete mess and Get-ChildItem would pretty much always have to be paired with Sort-Object when used interactively, which isn't really ideal. \r\n\r\nAdding an opt-in to more performant behaviour is definitely not _ideal_ (I would kinda prefer that as the default, really), but I think it's not an unreasonable concession to have slightly less performant behaviour for a cmdlet that's often used interactively. I think users will complain if they have to constantly reach for `gci | sort-object name` instead of just `gci` when working at a console.\r\n\r\nFor cases where the interactive behaviour is not necessary or particularly important, an option that can be provided (even as a default via $PSDefaultParameterValues) is an OK compromise in my opinion.",

Although the number of incompatible changes is already so great that it makes no sense to talk about backward compatibility.\r\n\r\n_We should be discussing and trying to implement modern innovative concepts more than pink colored letters or ala old school Unix behavior._",
