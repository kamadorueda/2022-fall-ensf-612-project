This means that whenever `Runspace.Open()` is called with an `InitialSessionState` based on `InitialSessionState.CreateDefault()` the _calling_ runspace's (nb. not just the newly-opened runspace's) ExecutionPolicy is changed to `Restricted`.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$originalPolicy = Get-ExecutionPolicy\r\n$originalPolicy\r\n\r\n$otherPolicy = if ( $originalPolicy -eq 'Bypass' )\r\n{\r\n    [Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy]::Restricted\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    [Microsoft.PowerShell.ExecutionPolicy]::Bypass\r\n}\r\n\r\n$initialSessionState = [initialsessionstate]::CreateDefault()\r\n$initialSessionState.ExecutionPolicy = $otherPolicy\r\n\r\n[runspacefactory]::CreateRunspace($initialSessionState).Open()\r\n\r\nGet-ExecutionPolicy\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nI expected `ExecutionPolicy` to be the same before and after `Runspace.Open()`\r\n\r\n```none\r\nRemoteSigned\r\nRemoteSigned\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n`ExecutionPolicy` is changed to `InitialSessionState.ExecutionPolicy`.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nRemoteSigned\r\nBypass\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-preview.688\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.1.0-preview.688\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 6.3.9600\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

Setting the execution policy simply sets a process-scope environment variable, affecting all runspaces.  That process scope env var takes precedence over any non-GPO execution policy (and is not cached anywhere, the environment gets parsed each time it needs to be checked, not sure exactly how often that happens, but it's not free).\r\n\r\nChanging this behavior would probably be considered breaking, so I guess that's out of the question.  Intuitively it does seem like it should be a property of the Runspace/SessionState (at least in the form of allowing the runspace to have \"Default\" inherit from the process, but allow for it to be overridden per Runspace).",
