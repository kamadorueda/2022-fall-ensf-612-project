  "body": "The official way of building PowerShell requires PowerShell (nice dogfooding idea, like Roslyn requires previous version of Roslyn with runtime and BCL to compile).\r\n\r\nFor new platforms bootstrap, it is a problem however: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/6367#issuecomment-372491315\r\n\r\nPlease add a build script for new platform and then add PowerShell submodule to source-build repo: https://github.com/dotnet/source-build, so we have a scripting capability on new system.\r\n\r\n@dseefeld, @weshaggard to comment on the idea of adding PowerShell as one of the source-build target.",
