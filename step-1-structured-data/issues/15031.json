  "body": "Include an option/directive for the 'Start-Process' cmdlet that allows the user to specify that stream output should be *appended to an existing output file when redirecting the stdout/stderr streams to file.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when using either the '-RedirectStandardOutput' or '-RedirectStandardError' parameters to specify output file paths for redirection of the standard streams to file, the behavior of 'Start-Process' is to create/overwrite if a specified file exists. There is no means to have the output appended to an existing file. This forces the user to come up with additional and, IMHO, seemingly unnecessary work-arounds in order to implement the append logic. This seems like something that could be relatively easily implemented at a lower level, and, quite frankly, seems like basic functionality that the cmdlet should already support.\r\n\r\nThis could be as simple as adding some kind of append specifier to each parameter:\r\n```\r\n# stdout files gets overwritten (default behavior), stderr file gets appended to ('>>' specifier)\r\nStart-Process -RedirectStandardOutput='logfile.txt' -RedirectStandardError='>>errlog.txt'\r\n```\r\nOf course, this could be setup in a variety of ways and/or as the powershell devs see fit.\r\n\r\nJustification:\r\nThere are a variety of cases where it would be useful to be able to have a complete output history of a child process' output, even when the same child process is created multiple times, or across multiple executions of the parent script/command. Having the ability to append output files directly from 'Start-Process' would increase its usefulness in this respect.\r\n\r\n",

To achieve this functionality we would have to change how the FileStream is opened here https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/4c40ab11401ff2ca19ee1206b7654ed299f373e6/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/Process.cs#L2263.\r\n\r\nAll that needs to be done to implement this functionality is to either change the mode to `FileMode.Append` or set to `FileMode.Open` and seek the FileStream to the end.",

This lack of stream integration is the primary reason not to use `Start-Process` with console applications.\r\n\r\nThese two common parameters therefore aren't terribly useful with `Start-Process`, but they do work as advertised:\r\n\r\n* `-OutVariable out` captures whatever `Start-Process` itself emits to the pipeline in variable `$foo`, which only applies when `-PassThru` is also specified in order to pass out the process-info object describing the newly launched process.\r\n\r\n* `-ErrorVariable err` captures the errors that `Start-Process` itself emits in variable `$err`, which is in effect limited to the inability to even _create_ the process (e.g., `Start-Process nosuch -ErrorVariable err`) - though I've just realized that appears to be broken on Unix-like platforms - see #15054.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
