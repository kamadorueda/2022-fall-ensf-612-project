  "body": "The use-case is to upgrade multiple modules to their new version. When there is a module with number of dependent modules Install-Module allows installing all dependent modules at once. If I need to upgrade the modules to new version with no willing to have multiple versions of certain module I'd expect to be able to uninstall module with all dependent modules at ones using Uninstall-Module.\r\n\r\nHere is an example\r\n\r\nModule A with version 1.0\r\nModule B with version 1.0, which is required module in the A module's manifest\r\n\r\nThis call:\r\nInstall-Module -Name A -RequiredVersion 1.0\r\n\r\ninstalls both A and B\r\n\r\nWhen new versions of the above modules are published\r\n\r\nModule A with version 2.0\r\nModule B with version 2.0\r\n\r\nI'd like to be able to \r\n\r\nUninstall-Module -Name A\r\nInstall-Module -Name A -RequiredVersion 2.0\r\n\r\nand as a result to have installed only\r\n\r\nA version 2.0\r\nB version 2.0\r\n",
