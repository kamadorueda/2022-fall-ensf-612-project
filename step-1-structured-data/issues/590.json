I'm most interested in the value of your `TERM` variable, as well as what software you're using to connect to the Linux box (as in the whole stack: host machine, terminal emulator; are you ssh-ing through say PuTTY on Windows or from another Linux box). Also, what shell were you in on Linux before starting PowerShell (bash, or dash,  or something else)?\n",

We can file a bug with dotnet/corefx, but I imagine `vt100` support is unlikely to be very high-priority.\n\nDo you know what `TERM` your terminal emulator is supposed to be at? The vast majority are `xterm` (this is true of PuTTY, OS X's Terminal, and most Linux DE's emulators).\n\nI'm **really** surprised you found a terminal with `vt100` as the default. What emulator are you using?\n",
