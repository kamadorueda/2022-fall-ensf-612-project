  "body": "I (and various customers of my company) notice that `Add-Content` often fails to append to files with an error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAdd-Content : The process cannot access the file\r\n'C:\\Users\\Administrator\\logs\\access_log.log' because it is being used by another process.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis happens if the file in question is being read (\"tailed\") by some other process at the same time, e.g. a log collection framework.\r\n\r\nI confirmed via ProcMon that this is because `Add-Content` takes a read lock on its target file. So if the file is already open for read by another process (even if that process has taken no locks), the cmdlet will fail.\r\n\r\nThis is unexpected. Why does a **writing** cmdlet need a **read** lock? `Out-File -Append` does essentially the same thing and takes no such lock. Others are confused as well: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30733610/get-content-wait-is-locking-the-file-while-it-reads-it-preventing-add-content, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10655788/powershell-set-content-and-out-file-what-is-the-difference\r\n\r\nAs far as I can surmise the relevant bit of code is here (`FileSystemProvider.GetContentWriter`):\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/4bc52d2358222084738157a08907fac32d13bd3a/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L6808\r\n\r\nCould `FileShare.Write` be changed to `FileShare.ReadWrite`?\r\n\r\nThis applies to both Windows PowerShell and PowerShell Core",
