Other options are:\r\n\r\n> You can workaround this by putting extra space: $herestr =@\"... or $herestr= @\"...; or by enclosing in parenthesis: ($herestr=@\"...\"@)\r\nThe option of enclosing in parenthesis causes the here document to be echoed but I can confirm that these options work in V5.0 (build 10586, revision 117)",
