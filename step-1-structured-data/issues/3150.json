And it does fail.\r\nThis issue is about the badge only.\r\nTravis CI doesn't have a way to run two different projects from the same repo.\r\nUnlike in appveyor, where we just have two projects for CI and for nightly.\r\nThat's why we mix all builds at the same travis project.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that Jim wrote automation to find last nightly build form the project and upload corresponding badge to `https://jimtru1979.blob.core.windows.net/badges/DailyBuildStatus.svg`.\r\n\r\nThis issue is about this automation.",
