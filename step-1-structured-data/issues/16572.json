      "body": "@kylinholmes What you are asking is a custom provider that organizes users, similar to the `Cert:`  and `WSMan:`. This can be done as a module by community members who are interested in this idea, but I don't think PowerShell team will not have the capacity to do it.\r\n\r\nI will move this issue to Discussions, where you may find someone also likes this idea.",
