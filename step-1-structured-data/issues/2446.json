  "body": "If you watch recorded demos of introductory PowerShell sessions delivered by people like @jpsnover, they inevitably show the famous select top 10 processes pipeline. When they do, they invoke something like this (with or without aliases, etc.):\n\n```\nGet-Process | sort WorkingSet64 -desc | select -first 10\n```\n\nAs they are entering that line, they very often (almost always) say top 10 as they type \"-first 10\". It's a small thing, but it's how the mind works. We want the top 10 processes, and technically, in the output, we're getting the top 10 since they are output vertically. I've always felt this would be better if the -First parameter of Select-Object had a -Top alias and the -Last parameter of Select-Object had a -Bottom alias. Such a change would allow for this instead:\n\n```\ngps | sort WorkingSet64 -desc | select -top 10\n```\n\nNow that PowerShell is open source, I decided to add them, see what you think. New parameter aliases are defined and new Pester tests are included for verification.\n",

      "body": "I like the intent, but the problem is that `top` and `bottom` implies sorting unlike `first` and `bottom` which is not sorted.  So ideally you would have:\n\n``` powershell\nget-process | select -top 10\n```\n\nbut is this top 10 by cpu usage, workingset, etc?\n\nNow we would have to include sorting semantics but this breaks the \"do one thing and do it well\" principle unless we can determine significant common use cases to justify it.  For example would we want to support this?\n\n``` powershell\nget-process | select -top 10 -select workingset64 -desc\n```\n\nBut that didn't really save much typing nor improve readability.\n",

      "body": "I agree with all of the comments, and I sat on this idea for a while for exactly the reason that -Top and -Bottom might imply sorting. I had considered creating new parameter sets for Select-Object for -Top/-Bottom that included sorting, but I couldn't convince myself that baking sorting into Select-Object was the right solution since Select-Object is a pretty well defined atomic command. In the end I decided that as parameter aliases it wasn't so bad, and that if I was going to go the route of actually doing sorting and selecting I might create a different cmdlet instead. I hadn't thought about putting -Top/-Bottom as parameters on Sort-Object though, and I really like that idea -- it makes much more sense in the context of Sort-Object. Is that something you want to run with @lzybkr or do you mind if I have a look?\n",
