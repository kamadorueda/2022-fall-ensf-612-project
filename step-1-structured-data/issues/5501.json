It's still present on 2016 with the latest (29-hour old) `windowservercore` container. I can check my 1709 server but some rough ETA would be greatly appreciated since it's now over a year since it was first identified.",

It really is ridiculous that i have to toggle psreadline on and off to paste in long lines of code.
