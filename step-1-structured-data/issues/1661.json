  "body": "- [x] Resolves issue #1609.\n- [x] Code is [rebased][sync] on `origin/master`.\n- [x] Add tests that fail without your changes.\n- [ ] Update all relevant [documentation][docs].\n\nRoot cause: Microsoft.WSMan.Management  and  Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Diagnostics  are not put in the default snapin list for win-ops, and thus when a runspace is created using RunspaceConfiguration, those 2 are not loaded as snapins by default, which is a behavior change compared to Nano PS.\nFix: Replace the guard 'PORTABLE' to be 'UNIX' so that they are in the default snapin list when targeting windows platform.\n",
