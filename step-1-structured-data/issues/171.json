      "body": "Currently, we call File.Exists() and Directory.Exists() to see if path is directory or file, AND if path exists.\n\nYes, we could do something like:\n\nFileAttributes fa = new File.GetAttributes(path);\nif (fa & FileAttributes.Directory == FileAttributes.Directory)\n{\n     // is directory\n}\nelse\n{\n    // is not directory\n}\n\nBut above code doesn't answer the question of whether the file/directory exists.  To do so, we would need to either:\n1.  Put try/catch around File.GetAttributes(), as this call will throw if path does not exist.\n2.  Do something like:\n\nFileInfo fi = new File.FileInfo(path);\nif (fi.Exists)\n{\n   // it's a file\n}\n\nDirectoryInfo di = new Directory.DirectoryInfo(path);\nif (di.Exists)\n{\n  // it's a directory\n}\nelse\n{\n   // it doesn't exist\n}\n\nI'm not sure if either solution is better or faster than current implementation of using File.Exists() and Directory.Exists().\n",
