  "body": "\r\n## PR Summary\r\n\r\nFix for #7267. You should be able to use `break` in a `switch` statement in a `finally` block but an erroneous parse error was being generated in this case. The fix is to change the semantic check to allow for `break` in labelled statements rather than only in loop statements.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",

      "body": "@TimCurwick When it's a `return` statement, the caller will pass in `null` for the `label` parameter, and thus it won't be affected by the changes in this PR at all.\r\n\r\nFor a `continue` statement, it's fine. Use `continue` in a switch clause will continue on the next item in the collection, or exit the switch statement if no item is available. That should continue to work in a `finally` block. See the example below:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nswitch -wildcard ( 'Hello World', 'World' )\r\n{\r\n     '*hello*'\r\n     {\r\n         \"process hello in '$_'\"\r\n     }\r\n     '*world*'\r\n     {\r\n          \"process world in '$_'\"\r\n     }\r\n}\r\n\r\n> process hello in 'Hello World'\r\n> process world in 'Hello World'\r\n> process world in 'World'\r\n\r\nswitch -wildcard ( 'Hello World', 'World' )\r\n{\r\n    '*hello*'\r\n    {\r\n         \"process hello in '$_'\"\r\n         continue\r\n    }\r\n    '*world*'\r\n    {\r\n         \"process world in '$_'\"\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n> process hello in 'Hello World'\r\n> process world in 'World'\r\n```",
