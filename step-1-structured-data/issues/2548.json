  "body": "Howdy @andschwa @vors!\n\nWe are looking for guidance on what to name the Chocolatey package for the core version of PowerShell?\n\nWe typically try to match the id with other package managers to allow for things like configuration management tools to simply be able to do something like:\n\n``` puppet\npackage {'powershell-core':\n  ensure => latest,\n}\n```\n\nAnd it works on all platforms. However we currently use `powershell` as the package id for the CLR version of PowerShell.\n\nAre you looking at using something like `powershell-core` for the .NET Core version or are you set on `powershell` as the name of the package?\n",

I think it would make sense to use `powershell-core`, then `-core` part would represent edition.  @joeyaiello @HemantMahawar @SteveL-MSFT  please correct me, if I'm misrepresenting anything.\n",
