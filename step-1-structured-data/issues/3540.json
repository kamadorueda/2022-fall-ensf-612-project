  "body": "`INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE` should be defined as `IntPtr(-1)` and not as `IntPtr.Zero`  (It is declared as `((HANDLE)-1)` in Windows SDK headers).\r\n\r\n - In [PlatformInvokes.cs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/utils/PlatformInvokes.cs#L561) file, it is declared as `IntPtr.Zero`. This value is used in [SSHConnectionInfo.GetNamedPipeHandle(string pipeName)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/common/RunspaceConnectionInfo.cs#L2280) method, and, if for some reason, `CreateFile` fails, it will be unable to detect error condition. Attempt to use invalid named pipe handle will certainly not go well.\r\n\r\n - In [Process.cs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Management/commands/management/Process.cs#L2611) file, it is declared as `IntPtr.Zero`. Fortunately, this value is not used anywhere else, but, nonetheless, it is invalid.\r\n\r\n - In [MainEntry.cpp](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/powershell-native/nativemsh/pwrshexe/MainEntry.cpp#L1142) file, in `IsWow64()` function, a pseudo-handle returned from `GetCurrentProcess()` Win32 API function is compared to `INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`. This time value is correct, but its usage is incorrect, because `GetCurrentProcess()` pseudo-handle is exactly same as value of `INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE`: both are `((HANDLE)-1)`. Because of this `IsWow64()` function always returns `FALSE`. `IsWow64()` function is used to decide correct file paths of Start Menu shortcuts for PowerShell and PowerShell ISE. Since FullCLR build is not supported currently, I can't verify this, but, just by reading code, it seems that shortcut targets will be messed up.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\r\nCLRVersion\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.18-9-g8d4db01a5d4b5dcd981ef216d3d7f24b484c7c60-dirty\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",
