  "body": "When you make an in-session culture change by changing the current thread's culture by assigning to `[cultureinfo]::CurrentCulture` (the same applies to `[cultureinfo]::CurrentUICulture`), PowerShell commendably propagates this change to:\r\n\r\n* new *threads* (`Start-ThreadJob`, `ForEach-Object -Parallel`)\r\n\r\n* remotely executed code (e.g., `Invoke-Command -ComputerName. ...`)\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly, however, background jobs (`Start-Job`, postpositional `&`) do _not_ propagate such changes.\r\n\r\nNote: This discrepancy has always existed, including in Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Note: If 'it-IT' happens to be your current culture, target a different one.\r\n[cultureinfo]::CurrentCulture = 'it-IT'\r\nStart-Job { [cultureinfo]::CurrentCulture.Name } | Receive-Job -Wait -AutoRemoveJob | Should -Be it-IT\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, because `Start-Job` executes the code in the child process with the culture that was in effect at session _start-up_ time rather than the currently effective one.\r\n\r\nE.g., if the persistently configured culture is `en-US`:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected strings to be the same, but they were different. \r\nString lengths are both 5. Strings differ at index 0. Expected: 'it-IT' But was:  'en-US'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.5\r\n```\r\n",
