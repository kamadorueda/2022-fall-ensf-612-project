  "body": "XML dot notation (PowerShells automatic adaptation of `XmlDocument` instances for surfacing elements and attributes as _properties_) works well for _getting_ the inner text of elements _by index_, but not for _setting_.\r\n\r\nAs an aside: Positional index-based access currently only works if at least two elements of the same name are present - see #11189.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[xml] $xml = @'\r\n<Lvl1>\r\n  <Lvl2>a</Lvl2>\r\n  <Lvl2>b</Lvl2>\r\n  <Only>c</Only>\r\n</Lvl1>\r\n'@\r\n\r\n# GETTING: OK\r\n$xml.Lvl1.Lvl2[0] | Should -Be 'a'\r\n\r\n# SETTING with scalar: OK\r\n$xml.Lvl1.Only = 'new'\r\n$xml.Lvl1.Only | Should -Be 'new'\r\n\r\n# SETTING with INDEX: FAILS QUIETLY\r\n$xml.Lvl1.Lvl2[0] = 'new'\r\n$xml.Lvl1.Lvl2[0] | Should -Be 'new'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe tests should succeed.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe 2nd test fails, because the assignment was _ignored_:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nStrings differ at index 0.
