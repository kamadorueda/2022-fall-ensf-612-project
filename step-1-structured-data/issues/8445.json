  "body": "# Documentation Issue\r\n\r\nThe [PowerShell documentation for `ConvertFrom-Csv`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/convertfrom-csv?view=powershell-6) for the optional parameter `-Header` states:\r\n\r\n\"_If you enter fewer column headers than there are columns, the remaining columns will have no headers_\"\r\n\r\nSince the `ConvertFrom-Csv` function appears to convert csv rows to `PSCustomObjects`, this implies that the data is available via some function. However, the data appears to have been discarded. In other words, the documentation should state:\r\n\r\n\"_If you enter fewer column headers than there are columns, the data for the remaining columns is discarded_\".\r\n\r\n**NOTE**:  This is also true for PowerShell 5 and possibly previous versions\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$csv = $(Write-Output \"a,b,c`nd,e,f`ng,h,i\" | ConvertFrom-Csv -Header 1)\r\n\r\n# The additional columns do not appear to be accessible because only the identified columns are displayed\r\n$csv\r\n$csv.''\r\n$csv | Get-Member\r\n$csv | Select-Object '*'\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf headerless columns can be accessed, then the following code should not produce an error:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\nWrite-Output \"a,b,c`nd,e,f`ng,h,i\" | ConvertFrom-Csv -Header @()\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.1\r\nOS                             Linux 4.14.83-1-MANJARO #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri No...\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

If both bugs should be in the repo that you mentioned (and shouldn't be created the way that I opened the other documentation issue), I can create both of them there.",
