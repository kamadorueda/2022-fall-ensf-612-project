  "body": "Linux is inherently case-sensitive while Windows and macOS are case-preserving.  To make it easier to work with Linux, consider adding `-IgnoreCase` switch to `Get-Item` and `Get-ChildItem`.  Of course, we would need to pass this to Providers so they work correctly (Environment Variables, for example, are also case-sensitive on Linux).\r\n",
