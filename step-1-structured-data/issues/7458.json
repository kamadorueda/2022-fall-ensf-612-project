Per the [about_Execution_Policies for PS v7](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7) documentation, if the Execution Policy is set to **Unrestricted** it:\r\n\r\n> Warns the user before running scripts and configuration files that are not from the local intranet zone\r\n\r\nSince the FQDN server name is explicitly added into the Local Intranet zone, I expected that PS v7 would allow scripts to run from this FQDN Local Intranet location, as it did in PS v5.1.\r\n\r\nThis also means that for environments where folder redirection is used where the Documents folder is redirected to a FQDN path, PS v7's $Profile script is affected by this also each time PS 7 starts.\r\n\r\nFrom [the previous comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7458#issuecomment-452249172), it appears that enabling the following settings worked:\r\n\r\n- Intranet Sites: Include all local (intranet) sites not listed in other zones\r\n- Intranet Sites: Include all network paths (UNCs)\" helped\r\n\r\nHowever, this was already set for me, and this problem persists in PS v7.

That would cover at least the domain's Netlogon folder on the domain's FQDN path.  Is there some other mechanism where we can inject using \"trusted locations\" that we used to be able to do via IE's Local Intranet zone?

For instance if you open a file from a FQDN path, and that path is not in the Local Intranet zone, it gives you some extra warnings when opening Office files.  After we add the Windows domain FQDN paths to the Local Intranet zone, it corrects that problem, and files from the FQDN UNC paths open as expected in Windows Explorer with no warnings.
