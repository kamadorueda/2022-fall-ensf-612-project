  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nQuery DNS for the name `myip.opendns.com` against the OpenDNS server `resolver1.opendns.com`, it should echo your connection's public IP address.\r\n\r\nNB. it will only retun an A record on an IPv4 connection, an AAAA record on an IPv6 connection; mixing them and querying for an A record using an IPv6 connection returns a \"name not found\" lookup fail. On my connection which supports both IPv4 and IPv6, this happens:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> Resolve-DnsName -Name myip.opendns.com -Server resolver1.opendns.com\r\nresolve-dnsname : myip.opendns.com : DNS name does not exist\r\n```\r\n\r\nA WireShark packet capture shows that this goes out over IPv6 and queries both A and AAAA records. The A record lookup gets a \"DNS name does not exist\" response - lookup fail. The AAAA record gets an IPv6 address back. PowerShell is showing me the fail, rather than the success.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/187787/100550512-5a71cc80-3272-11eb-8a1e-87200fcb3f58.png)\r\n\r\nNB. that I can specify `-Type AAAA` and get a valid result, but I can't see a way to choose whether Resolve-DnsName uses IPv4 or IPv6 for its connection, so I have no way of knowing whether I should specify `-Type A` or `-Type AAAA`. One will match the connection it uses and one will not, so I would have to try both. Which is annoying, given that it defaults to trying both for me already - the only problem is it throws away the more useful result in favour of the less useful result.\r\n\r\n## Expected result\r\n\r\nThe data from the successful query, because it's more useful.\r\n\r\n## Actual result\r\n\r\nThe IPv4 lookup fail takes precedence, I see an exception, and the successful query data is lost to the void. \r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",
