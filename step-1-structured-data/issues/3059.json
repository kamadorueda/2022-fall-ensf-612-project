I can now successfully import after the ISE startup but cannot dot source the module into my ISE profile as ISE gets stuck trying to process the module and I have to force quit the application. I had to uninstall the WMF v5.1 to get it to work again. It seems like it doesn't like the module manifest for some reason even though the `Test-ModuleManifest` returns no errors.",
