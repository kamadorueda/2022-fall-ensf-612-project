To support\r\ndisconnecting, the remote computer must be running Windows PowerShell 3.0 or a later version of Windows PowerShell.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Disconnect-PSSession $Session\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: ([PSSession]Session1:PSSession) [Disconnect-PSSession], RuntimeExcepti\r\n   on\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PSSessionDisconnectFailed,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.DisconnectPSSessionCommand\r\n```\r\nLocally I have Powershell version 4 running. And `Get-PSSessionConfiguration` shows PSVersion 4 at server. And `Remove-PSSession` works perfectly. Any help appreciated",

      "body": "Hi @kireetivvs, just to make sure we're talking about the same thing, `Disconnect-PSSession` is not the same as `Remove-PSSession`. `Remove` removes the remote runspace then closes the connection. `Disconnect` closes the connection but leaves the remote session running so you can reconnect to it at a later time.  Also be aware that  [`Get-PSSessionConfiguration`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/get-pssessionconfiguration?view=powershell-6)  returns information about the _local_ computer not remote ones.",
