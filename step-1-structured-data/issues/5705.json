I suspect other folks will use the PS Core started by the installer as the easy means to get PS Core pinned to their taskbar.\r\n\r\nIf the installer could set the working dir to the current user's home dir before launching PowerShell, that would probably fix both scenarios.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-rc.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-rc.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

However, if I then right-click on the shell and pin it to the taskbar, the `Start in` is still the installation location of pwsh.",
