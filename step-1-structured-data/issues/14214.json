There is also no text on the tile underneath the icon.  \r\n\r\nReinstalling PowerShell does not resolve the issue.\r\n\r\n**Screenshot showing PowerShell icon compared to correct Start menu icons:**\r\n\r\n![PowerShell Icon](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/27423064/99883049-98d90d00-2c1c-11eb-9333-03a43f9ac273.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether it's related to the changes that were made to the Start menu in Windows 10 20H2, as I haven't installed in on earlier Windows versions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe Start menu icon should be the same size as other icons and also have the 'PowerShell' text label on the Start menu tile underneath the icon.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
