  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nA simple cmdlet to create a hash table (indexed lookup) for an array objects with properties.  While simple to do in code, it is a pattern I often find myself repeating over and over again in code and could probably be further enhanced by being built-in.\r\n\r\nThe general idea here is I have large array of objects with properties many of which are unique.  For example, all uses from an Active Directory forest.  Now let's say I have some SQL database that provides a user's user principal name and I need to lookup some other property of the user.  So, the lazy mans way of doing this might be find the users by doing:\r\n\r\n```\r\nForEach ($Row in $Rows)\r\n{\r\n   $UserData = $AllUsers | Where-Object { $_.UserPrincipalName -eq $Row.User }\r\n   Write-Host $UserData.SamAccountName\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor these scenarios, I often find myself using a simple pattern of creating a hash-based index for reuse: \r\n\r\n```\r\n$UserHash = @{}\r\n$AllUsers | ForEach-Object { $UserHash[$_.UserPrincipalName] = $_ }\r\nForEach ($Row in $Rows)\r\n{\r\n   Write-Host $UserHash[$Row.User].SamAccountName\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThis change can often result in 100x performance improvement for sufficiently large datasets.  \r\n\r\nIf somebody is already aware of a better way to do this using current cmdlets, please educate me accordingly.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nWhile it only takes two lines to implement this pattern, it would be more readable (and potentially higher performing) if we could avoid the need for a script block and wrap it into something more readable like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$UserHash = ConvertTo-HashTableLookup -InputObject $Array -Property 'HashKeyProperty'\r\n```\r\nGiven my perceived simplicity of this, I would be more than happy to work on it.\r\n",
