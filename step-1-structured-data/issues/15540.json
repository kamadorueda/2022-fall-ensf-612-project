This repository maintains PowerShell 7, which is now different from PS 5.1 in a few important ways.

After that I startet die Setup.exe from the ISO. I \"Reinstalled\" Windows 10 with the option to keep my apps and documents. At first place I had an error 0xC1900101 - 0x2000c. I disconnected my dockingstation and tryed it again. Now it run successfully and I can use PowerShell again.\r\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/67965269/windows-powershell-microsoft-powershell-commands-utility-not-found/67982788#67982788 \n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/Img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>Stack Overflow</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67965269/windows-powershell-microsoft-powershell-commands-utility-not-found\">Windows PowerShell - Microsoft.Powershell.Commands.Utility not found</a></strong></div><div>I first discovered that PowerShell is not working correctly when I open my VisualStudio 2019.
