Run `pwsh -v` (if, you cannot launch PowerShell Core using `pwsh` you are affected).\r\n  If the reported version starts with `6.0.1`, you are affected.\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Get PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell#get-powershell)\r\nto install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\r\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\r\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\r\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\r\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\r\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\r\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n[Ben Adams](https://twitter.com/ben_a_adams) of [Illyriad Games](https://www.illyriad.co.uk/)\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-0875](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-0875)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (Mar 15, 2018): Advisory published.\r\n\r\n*Version 1.0*\r\n*Last Updated 2018-03-15*",
