This is a sporadic issue.\r\n\r\n- As I have been troubleshooting this I worked on it in the morning. Then when I come home, my laptop hibernating, the exact same command might work again.\r\n- In VS Code I have setup a build task which basically copies the necessary module files, leaving .gitignore, logs and other files I don't want included when publishing the module. If I run the `Test-ModuleManifest` cmdlet against the files that was written via the \"build\" task. It might fail. However, if I run `Test-ModuleManifest` against the .psd1 file in the root of the repo it might work. And vice versa.\r\n- I have read > https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878337(v=vs.85).aspx ... \r\n- I compared my manifest against the manifest of public and solid modules such as Pester and Plaster. I cannot see any issues with my manifest. And! As I've stated, sometimes `Test-ModuleManifest` works on the MyModule.psd1 manifest. Without me chaning anything in the MyModule.psd1 file.\r\n- I've tried to execute `Import-Module` on both the MyModule.psm1 and the MyModule.psd1 files and they successfully import.\r\n- For good meassure here is the manifest of my module. Which `Test-ModuleManifest` sometimes an test successfully and sometimes not.\r\n\r\n```\r\n@{\r\n\r\n    # Script module or binary module file associated with this manifest.\r\n    RootModule = 'MyModule.psm1'\r\n\r\n    # ID used to uniquely identify this module\r\n    GUID = 'c1e187cd-222f-4df6-8238-88f90f0284ff'\r\n\r\n    # Version number of this module.\r\n    ModuleVersion = '0.0.12'\r\n\r\n    # Author of this module\r\n    Author = 'https://github.com/larssb | https://bengtssondd.it'\r\n\r\n    # Company or vendor of this module\r\n    CompanyName = 'Bengtsson Driven Development'\r\n\r\n    # Copyright statement for this module\r\n    Copyright = '(C) https://github.com/larssb | https://bengtssondd.it.

      "body": "@daxian-dbw, I'm experiencing similar behavior, if not the same as @larssb has mentioned. Currently I'm working on [PowerShellGet #294](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/294) issue for Update-ModuleManifest which uses Test-ModuleManifest internally.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm stepping thru Update-ModuleManifest, I'll introspect the data going into Test-ModuleManifest and it looks good. But the data that it returns is missing or strangely in some cases, reverted to previous values. \r\n\r\nAfter glancing into [Test-ModuleManifest](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/TestModuleManifestCommand.cs) source code several times I have a couple of questions.\r\n\r\n1. What's the need for checking multiple files in the directory of this cmdlet's Path parameter, while it seems to test just one?  [These comments and if statements.](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/ef104601727745f357bc95f32d4a43c6df2a54f1/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/TestModuleManifestCommand.cs#L76)\r\n2. Also, Update-ModuleManifest performs several IO operations and in doing so creates a temp file (with .psd1 extension) in the same directory as the file to be updated. Is this something that should be considered risky when using Test-ModuleManifest?  Because it seems that Test-ModuleManifest is retrieving data perhaps somewhere else in some cases as @larssb and I have noticed.  And risky considering my 1st question.\r\n3. And finally, what's the intention of Import-PowerShellDataFile command?  Should that be used instead of Test-ModuleManifest for accessing data? I see in PowerShellGet source code that Test-ModuleManifest is used to access data for its output.  Which seems weird considering its verb name, 'Test'.\r\n\r\nHopefully that is explained clearly, if not please let me know.",

      "body": "@mklement0  It appears @kilasuit  has indirectly led to an interesting workaround you might want to try.\r\n\r\nIn your PowerShell Profile, you might be able to **disable the cache** (rather than ever clearing it) by doing:\r\n```powershell\r\n$env:PSModuleAnalysisCachePath = 'nul'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can't say for sure this will work, though, as the code I highlighted above in ModuleCmdletBase.cs is clearly incorrect (and the comments above the code don't actually match what the code is doing, at all).\r\n\r\nI still think the behavior is rather bad/sub-optimal, since there is definitely analysis that is still being cached. Note in my example below how a WARNING is only emitted the first time:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> $env:PSModuleAnalysisCachePath = 'nul'\r\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> cd c:\\source\\Infrastructure\\SqlClone\\\r\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> Test-ModuleManifest SqlClone.psd1\r\nWARNING: The module manifest member 'ModuleToProcess' has been deprecated.

Here is a quick repro to show that following @kilasuit  guidance works, whereas outright disabling the cache (as documented)... doesn't actually disable the cache! :psyduck:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\source\\Infrastructure\\SqlClone\\> get-module -list -refresh | out-null\r\n\r\nPS C:\\source\\Infrastructure\\SqlClone\\> Test-ModuleManifest SqlClone.psd1\r\nWARNING: The module manifest member 'ModuleToProcess' has been deprecated.

It is probably because the cache file is written to on a background thread, and the packing of the cache data structure into a blob of bytes occurs *AFTER* the fact, so disabling the _file cache_ does not disable the _cache_.  Just guessing.  Either way, the code is totally bonkers.\r\n\r\nThe first steps here in my mind is an engineer at Microsoft should create a flow chart or some kind of architecture diagram to disect how this SHOULD work, since the code is completely crazy and full of micro-optimizations that probably don't add a lot of value for the complexity it adds.",
