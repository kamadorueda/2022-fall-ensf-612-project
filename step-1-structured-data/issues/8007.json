  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nOn a Windows machine, in a location which utilizes Previous Versions, request the previous versions, specifically of a folder.  Select a previous version of the selected folder, and then press the 'Open' button.\r\n\r\n(In my case I was on a mapped network drive, of a Windows 2012 R2 file server)\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nWindows Explorer opens a view of the folder in its previous state.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nPowerShell 6 opens at the selected location and point in time instead.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\nWindows 10 1803\r\nPowerShell 6.1.0\r\n\r\nI believe this is happening as I chose the option during installation of PowerShell 6.1 to enable the PowerShell context menu on folders.\r\n\r\nWhen PowerShell opened, I simply commanded `START .` and Explorer opened up the view of the folder instead.  I actually opened the folder multiple times to insure the same result, I was so caught by surprise.\r\n",
