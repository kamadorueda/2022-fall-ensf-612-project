  "body": "In order to make a module work on netstandard2.0 in Windows PowerShell, it is necessary to include netstandard.dll.\r\n\r\nSee here for more details: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/cmdlet-example/command-line-simple-example.md\r\n\r\nThe issue with this is that different versions of this could be included with different modules. It could cause dependency problems. It would be great if the netstandard.dll was either included somehow or was distributed as a module on the gallery so that module authors could reference it and the PSGet cmdlets would resolve the module correctly.
