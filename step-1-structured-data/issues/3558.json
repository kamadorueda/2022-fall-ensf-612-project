  "body": "On Unix, it is a convention for shells to accept `-i` for an interactive shell and many\r\ntools expect this behavior (`script` for example, and when setting powershell as the\r\ndefault shell) and calls the shell with the `-i` switch.  This change is breaking in\r\nthat `-i` previously could be used as short hand to match `-inputformat` which now will\r\nneed to be `-in`.\r\n\r\nAddresses https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3319\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
