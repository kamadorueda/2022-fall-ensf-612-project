  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nOpen PWSH as Adminstrator via Start > PowerShell > PowerShell 7 (x64) > Run as Administrator and run the below command. In Windows PowerShell 5.1.x it works fine. Hence, seems a regression.\r\nI haven't tried the command in any prior PWSH version.\r\nAlso, SCPolicySvc is not the only service set-service fails to set with the same error message. However, it doesn't fail to set all services, just certain ones.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32> set-service -name SCPolicySvc -startuptype disabled ; stop-service -name SCPolicySvc -force\r\nPS C:\\WINDOWS\\system32>\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS C:\\Windows\\System32> set-service -name SCPolicySvc -startuptype disabled ; stop-service -name SCPolicySvc -force\r\nSet-Service: Service 'Smart Card Removal Policy (SCPolicySvc)' cannot be configured due to the following error: Access is denied.\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\System32>\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nget-error\r\n\r\nException             :\r\n    Type           :\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Commands.ServiceCommandException\r\n    ServiceName    : SCPolicySvc\r\n    Message        : Service 'Smart Card Removal Policy\r\n(SCPolicySvc)' cannot be configured due to the following error:\r\nAccess is denied.\r\n    InnerException :\r\n        Type            : System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception\r\n        NativeErrorCode : 5\r\n        ErrorCode       : -2147467259\r\n        Message         : Access is denied.\r\n        HResult         : -2147467259\r\n    HResult        : -2146233087\r\nTargetObject          : System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController\r\nCategoryInfo          : PermissionDenied:\r\n(System.ServiceProcess.ServiceController:ServiceController)\r\n[Set-Service], ServiceCommandException\r\nFullyQualifiedErrorId : CouldNotSetService,Microsoft.PowerSh\r\nell.Commands.SetServiceCommand\r\nInvocationInfo        :\r\n    MyCommand        : Set-Service\r\n    ScriptLineNumber : 1\r\n    OffsetInLine     : 1\r\n    HistoryId        : 359\r\n    Line             : set-service -name SCPolicySvc\r\n-startuptype disabled ; stop-service -name SCPolicySvc -force\r\n    PositionMessage  : At line:1 char:1\r\n                       + set-service -name SCPolicySvc\r\n-startuptype disabled ; stop-service -n \u2026\r\n                       +\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    InvocationName   : set-service\r\n    CommandOrigin    : Internal\r\nScriptStackTrace      : at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 1\r\nPipelineIterationInfo :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\System32>\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n$PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Windows\\System32>\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8216601/146665237-d4d7d11f-d0ab-4733-b72b-c645c61ea0bf.png)\r\n",

Your account will have the ability to change the config but not write the DAC or owner thus it failing to open the service handle.\r\n\r\nThe extra access rights were added so that it would be able to set the service security descriptor. I think the better option here would be to only add those 2 extra access rights only if `-SecurityDescriptorSddl` was also specified rather than all the time.",
