  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nI recommend that URIs are either removed from Invoke-RestMethod's verbose output, or that they can be, according to the developer's _preference_. There is the possibility that a URI should be secure and therefore, shouldn't appear in any verbose output. If it is considered secure, this is immediately lost, if for instance it's retrieved from Azure Key Vault and  then ends up in someone's verbose output.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12057058/102109677-8c963900-3df1-11eb-8fc2-53f5e439a66b.png)\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nRemoving a URI from the verbose output would likely be the easiest option. Others may prefer URIs remain in the command's verbose output, however. Therefore, perhaps there should be a mechanism/variable that displays/doesn't display the default Invoke-RestMethod's verbose output. Moving forward, maybe there should be something bigger here. It's possible that this isn't the only command that may output information that a developer doesn't want shared. Perhaps this thought/design could be future-proofed, so that other information shown in verbose output, can be removed.\r\n",

Therefore, if my code were to access Azure Key Vault (for example), obtain the URI, assign it to an environment variable, run Invoke-RestMethod using the environment variable, as the Uri parameter value, then it's going to be exposed by Write-Verbose, as I can't remove the environment variable from memory/the session until the command has completed. Therefore, it can easily be written to the PowerShell hosting program.\r\n\r\nI do understand that the environment variable would briefly exist where the user can obtain it, if they knew what they were doing. Still, it would prove helpful in this instance to be able to control what is/isn't written by Invoke-RestMethod. _Perhaps_ I should just control whether Invoke-RestMethod can write verbose commands or not (Verbose:$false). Either way, I wanted to put this out there for discussion; thank you for your time and consideration.",

I saw the changes made **daxian-dbw**; however, I'm interested in how I control the URI/verbose output. I've installed 7.2.0-preview.3. Was there a change made in this version? I still see the URI in the verbose output, but perhaps there's more I need to know in order to experience any changes.
