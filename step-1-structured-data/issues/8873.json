  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSome languages like `Rust` allow a trailing comma in a parameter or argument list. In PowerShell, this would look like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam($a,)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWithout allowing a trailing comma, some people resort to formatting like the following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam( [Parameter(Mandatory)][string] $Thing\r\n     , [Parameter()][string] $AnotherThing\r\n     , [Parameter()][string] $YetAnotherThing\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe \"leading\" comma syntax gets used to minimize the lines changed when adding new parameters.\r\n\r\nIf a trailing comma was allowed, this style would be replaced with:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam( [Parameter(Mandatory)][string] $Thing,\r\n       [Parameter()][string] $AnotherThing,\r\n       [Parameter()][string] $YetAnotherThing,\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis could also be applied to method argument lists:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$something.Insert($offset, $value,)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis usage might see less use than in parameter lists though as parameter lists usually span multiple lines whereas argument lists often do not.\r\n```",

There is also non 0 number of those who tried to tackle this problem like Rust or Json5.\r\n\r\nFuthermore it doesn't break compatibility and its in spirit with other PowerShell features. For example, array elements can be specified with comma or with new lines, also hashtables. That is one of the main reasons for me why are they so enjoyable to work with. ",
