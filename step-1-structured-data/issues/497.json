  "body": "After renaming in #483, our integrations had some problems. Travis handled everything fine except for the badge. AppVeyor appears okay after updating the project URL (though the AppVeyor project itself is stuck with the old URL). Waffle needs to be deleted and remade per waffleio/waffle.io#2014 (which, though annoying, doesn't lose any information).\n",
