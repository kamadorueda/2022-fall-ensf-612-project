  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nAs a user I want to programmatically create scheduled tasks that run on e.g., the 5th of the month, or say, the 3rd Tuesday. So that I can fully automate my scheduled job creation.  Currently New-ScheduledTaskTrigger allows the creation of daily and weekly schedules, but not monthly.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nExample powershell experience:\r\n`ps> $act = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute \"calc.exe\"`\r\n`ps> $sch = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Monthly -At 3pm -DaysOfMonth 5 # Jan 5th, Feb 5th, etc.`\r\n`ps> Register-ScheduledTask -Action $act-Trigger $sch -TaskName 'My task name'`\r\n\r\n",
