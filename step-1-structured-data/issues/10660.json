On Windows PS V6 and V7 can manage  printers and print jobs but not submit a job to a printer. \r\n\r\nOn Linux one should be able to use | lp and use the built in command.  \r\n \r\n",

      "body": "@iSazonov  Yes. Completely agree, cmdlets should work on all supported OSes, but this a _should_, not a _must_.  We already have a Printer Management module which manages printer drivers, settings, queues and jobs (and it might make sense to out Out-Printer to this module). But this module only understands Windows print-devices, print-queues and print-jobs; Unix-based OSes have their own command line tools for managing these,  Windows didn't have until PowerShell added them (and the \"Print\" command which has been around since DOS, is still in CMD but only sends a printer ready file to a port name like \"PRN\" or \"LPT2\" so is effectively \"broken\") .   \r\n\r\n- My understanding of Linux isn't the best but AIUI you can do` command | lp `  and send Output to the printer. \r\n- Windows PowerShell 5 has Out-Printer with an alias of `lp` so you can do  `command | lp`  and send Output to the printer. \r\n- The only place where `command | lp`  _doesn't work_ is on PowerShell core when running on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to plug that gap.  Having something missing from some OSes is undesirable,  but having something which was in Windows PowerShell 5 missing in 7 is probably worse - especially as any linux shell, including pwsh can print using` | lp` , which is their solution until the .NET portable subset gets printing support.
