  "body": "JsonConfigFileProcessor needs inter-process synchronization to handle competing IO from different processes on the same file. If a process attempts to read the file while another process has the write lock, the read will fail. Within a single process, this is gracefully managed by ReaderWriterLockSlim. We need an inter-process version of it for this scenario.\n## Steps to reproduce\n1. Start powershell and attach a debugger to it. \n2. Set a BP in SetExecutionPolicy\n3. `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope LocalMachine Restricted`\n4. Step through the code until it opens the FileStream for the config file\n5. In another process, start PowerShell and `Get-ExecutionPolicy -list`\n## Expected behavior\n\nThe second process should block until the first finishes its write.\n## Actual behavior\n\n``` powershell\nPS > get-executionpolicy -list\n\n        Scope ExecutionPolicy\n        ----- ---------------\nMachinePolicy       Undefined\n   UserPolicy       Undefined\n      Process       Undefined\nget-executionpolicy : The process cannot access the file\n'C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\PowerShell\\Configuration\\PowerShellProperties.json' because it is being used by another process.\nAt line:1 char:1\n+ get-executionpolicy -list\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [Get-ExecutionPolicy], IOException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.IO.IOException,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.GetExecutionPolicyCommand\n```\n## Environment data\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\nName                           Value\n----                           -----\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.7-116-gd26b614837f657c1984d0f5e89c9395e4c56e6b8\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\nCLRVersion\nPSEdition                      PowerShellCore\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha\n```\n",
