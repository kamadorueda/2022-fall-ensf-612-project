  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the newly introduced, Unix-only `Switch-Process` cmdlet (alias `exec`) is _not_ designed to have full feature parity with the `exec` built-in in POSIX-compatible shells, notably not with respect to supporting stream redirections.\r\n\r\nHowever, making the replacement process inherit the caller's environment is an important part of `exec` functionality (and it is how it works in POSIX-compatible shells).\r\n\r\nRelated discussion predating `Switch-Process`:\r\n* #12750\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Run on macOS or Linux.\r\n# Note the use of `exec`; if you remove it, 'bar' prints as expected\r\npwsh -nop -c '$env:FOO=''bar''; exec /bin/sh -c ''echo $FOO'''\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nbar\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n(no output)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 7.3.0-rc.1 on Unix-like platforms\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
