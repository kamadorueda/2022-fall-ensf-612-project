  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have an issue similar to what was reported here: #10136 and #5868  (possibly others)\r\n\r\nThis feels/looks similar to a Double Hop problem, however It's intermittent and not specifically related.\r\n\r\n# Scenario\r\nWhen I connect from one machine to the second using WSMAN, I am (intermittently) unable to map a drive to a 2nd hop file share, even though I am providing fresh credentials.\r\n\r\nNew-PSDrive fails with the error:\r\n\r\n**Exception:** \r\n     System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (1312): A specified logon session does not exist. It may already have been terminated.\r\n\r\n**FullyQualifiedError:** \r\n     CouldNotMapNetworkDrive,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewPSDriveCommand\r\n\r\nThe strange things is that you can generally connect the first time, then never the 2nd time. However if you set the **new-psdrive -scope local** then you can connect the 2nd time and there after.\r\n\r\nHowever if you connect the first time without **-scope local** and then you set **-scope local** the 2nd time, then you cannot connect. However if you wait a certain amount of time then you can connect again.\r\n\r\nremoving the pssession and creating that does not help. rebooting the 2nd machine and then reconnecting doesn't work, rebooting the client machine doesn't work.\r\n\r\nHere is the code for the repro\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\n$PS7ComputerName = 'AZC1ADFS1DC01'\r\n$SAName = 'stagecus1'\r\nif (!($Cred)){$cred = get-credential $SAName}\r\n$root = \"\\\\$SAName.file.core.windows.net\\source\"\r\n\r\n# Test against PC 7 preview 6 . . works fine only the first time when not using new-psdrive -scope local.\r\n$psSessionEndPoint7 = \"PowerShell.7-preview\"\r\n$s7 = New-PSSession -ComputerName $PS7ComputerName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue -ConfigurationName $psSessionEndPoint7 #-SessionOption $pso\r\n$s7\r\n\r\nicm -Session $s7 -ScriptBlock {\r\n    $cred = $using:cred\r\n    $drive = 'P'\r\n\r\n    write-warning \"hostname:  $(hostname)\"\r\n    write-warning \"PSVersion: $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion.tostring())\"\r\n\r\n    if (-not(get-psdrive -name $drive -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue))\r\n    {\r\n        Try {\r\n            New-PSDrive -name $drive -Root $using:root -PSProvider FileSystem -Credential $using:cred -Persist -EA Stop -Scope local | ft -auto\r\n            dir \"${drive}:\\\" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\r\n        }\r\n        Catch {\r\n            $_ | select *\r\n            #$_.exception\r\n            #$_.exception.stacktrace\r\n        }\r\n        finally {\r\n            get-psdrive -name $drive -ea 0 | remove-psdrive\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior - map the drive and list the files\r\n\r\n```none\r\nWARNING: hostname:  azc1adfs1dc01\r\nWARNING: PSVersion: 7.0.0-preview.6\r\n\r\nName Used (GB) Free (GB) Provider   Root                                     CurrentLocation\r\n---- --------- --------- --------   ----                                     ---------------\r\nP         7.17   5112.83 FileSystem \\\\stagecus1.file.core.windows.net\\source\r\n\r\n    Directory: P:\\\r\n\r\nMode        LastWriteTime Length Name              PSComputerName\r\n----        ------------- ------ ----              --------------\r\nd----   9/5/2019  2:15 PM        AADAppProxy       AZC1ADFS1DC01\r\nd----   9/5/2019  2:15 PM        ADConnect         AZC1ADFS1DC01\r\nd----   9/5/2019  2:15 PM        AZFileSync        AZC1ADFS1DC01\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nOnce you remove the scope\r\nE.g.\r\n```powershell\r\nNew-PSDrive -name $drive -Root $using:root -PSProvider FileSystem -Credential $using:cred -Persist -EA Stop #-Scope local\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will map the drive only 1 time, then it will fail again.\r\n\r\n- adding the scope again does not fix the issue, unless you wait. then try again later.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nWARNING: hostname:  azc1adfs1dc01\r\nWARNING: PSVersion: 7.0.0-preview.6\r\n\r\nPSMessageDetails      :\r\nException             : System.ComponentModel.Win32Exception (1312): A specified logon session does not exist.

I suppose CredSSP is allowing New-PSDrive to use the passed on credentials.\r\n\r\nICM+New-PSDrive does not work** if ICM is used as:\r\n```\r\n1. -HostName <name> -SSHTransport\r\n2. -ComputerName <name>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**This works once and fails on subsequent attempts. This will work again, 15 minutes after the first attempt that worked. This is where the 'cached credentials must be expiring'.
