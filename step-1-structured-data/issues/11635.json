  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nIt is currently possible with pwsh to connect from linux to windows over SSH\r\nwith an pubkey or with the help of a regular password.\r\nBoth methods are working, but the auth method with a password has some benefits\r\nbecause the remote shell will run under the users credentials with a valid windows token.\r\n\r\nCommands that require a valid windows credentials token will then work\r\nGet-VM -ComputerName @(\"server1\", \"server2\", \"server2\")\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nOption1:\r\nSSHConnectionInfo does currently not allow to set an user password. \r\nit could await the output of \"ssh\" process on \"Password:\" and write\r\nthe password into the input stream\r\n\r\nOption2:\r\nSome command to upgrade the pssession with a valid WindowsUserToken\r\nlike \"Switch-User\"",
