  "body": "We have a script that runs just fine on Powershell 5, but when executing on devops agenst running ubuntu and powershell core 7.1 it always fails with a 401 Error.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$Password = ConvertTo-SecureString $MongoAtlasApiKeyPrivate -AsPlainText -Force\r\n$Credentials = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ($MongoAtlasApiKeyPublic, $Password)\r\n\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -Uri $MongoAtlasApiUrl -Method POST -ContentType \"application/json\" -Credential $Credentials -Body $json\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's trying to callt he mongo atlas api, which according to mongo's documentation requires digest authentictaion. However I couldn't find anything mentioning digest with Invoke-WebRequest. Onlny Oauth and other auth methods, but nothing about digest. Is it just no possible anymore since PWSH 6/7?\r\n\r\nThis is the corresponding mongo documentation: https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/reference/api/whitelist-add-one",

      "body": "I found an example for `digest` authentication [here](https://www.msxfaq.de/tools/prtg/getfritzmactable.htm#das_skript). It is in german, you see in the `.ps1` that the parameter `-credential` is used with `Invoke-RestMethod`. I think this is digest, as in the \"Wireshark\" part of the linked website you see the use of digest: `www-authenticate: digest`. I think that `curl` can be used with any method with the parameter `--anyauth` and has `--digest` as param as well. [Here](https://superuser.com/a/1574321/411849) is more on digest. ",
