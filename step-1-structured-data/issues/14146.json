  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSpecifying the `System.` prefix of a type name in PowerShell type literals is optional; e.g., both `[System.Text.Utf8Encoding]` and `[Text.Utf8Encoding]` work.\r\n\r\nHowever, tab completion only works if you also type the `System.` prefix\r\n\r\nJust like omitting the `System.` prefix is permitted in fully formed type literals, something like the following should work:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# SHOULD expand to [Text.Utf8Encoding] (or [System.Text.Utf8Encoding], but currently doesn't do anything.\r\nPS> [text.utf8<press tab here>  \r\n```\r\n",
