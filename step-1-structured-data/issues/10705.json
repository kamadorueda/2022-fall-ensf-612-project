Get-Command gets the commands from PowerShell modules and commands that were imported from other sessions. To get only commands that have been imported into the current session, use the ListImported parameter. Without parameters, Get-Command gets all of the cmdlets, functions, and aliases installed on the computer. Get-Command * gets all types of commands, including all of the non-PowerShell files in the Path environment variable ($env:Path), which it lists in the Application command type. Get-Command that uses the exact name of the command, without wildcard characters, automatically imports the module that contains the command so that you can use the command immediately. To enable, disable, and configure automatic importing of modules, use the $PSModuleAutoLoadingPreference preference variable. For more information, see about_Preference_Variables. Get-Command gets its data directly from the command code, unlike Get-Help, which gets its information from help topics. Starting in Windows PowerShell 5.0, results of the Get-Command cmdlet display a Version column by default. A new Version property has been added to the CommandInfo class. </div></blockquote>\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/media/logos/logo-ms-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/test-connection\">Test-Connection (Microsoft.PowerShell.Management)</a></strong></div><div>The Test-Connection cmdlet sends Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets, or pings, to one or more remote computers and returns the echo response replies. You can use this cmdlet to determine whether a particular computer can be contacted across an IP network. You can use the parameters of Test-Connection to specify both the sending and receiving computers, to run the command as a background job, to set a time-out and number of pings, and to configure the connection and authentication. Unlike the familiar ping command, Test-Connection returns a Win32_PingStatus object that you can investigate in PowerShell. The Quiet parameter returns a Boolean value in a System.Boolean object for each tested connection. If multiple connections are tested, an array of Boolean values is returned. </div></blockquote>\r\n",
