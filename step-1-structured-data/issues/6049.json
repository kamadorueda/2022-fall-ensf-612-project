  "body": "So this is something I've experienced while attempting to use Core to solve a User Profile archiving problem that's been a thorn in our side when users have paths that exceed the usual 255 character limit. Through some experimentation I've found that long path support works perfectly as long as you are local or working through a mapped drive, but it does not work through UNC Paths.\r\n\r\nVery well could be associated with #4439 or other long path issues that are currently open, but none of them directly mention UNC paths or seem like they should be closed at this point. Figured I'd put this in anyways just to check.\r\n\r\nSeems to not work regardless of if you are trying to copy Remote > Remote or Remote > Local. Accessing a Share vs Admin Share also does not matter.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n```powershell\r\n#On the \"Remote\" machine do some setup of the test files\r\n$aName = \"a\"*255\r\nSet-Location C:\\Users\\Test\\Documents\r\nNew-Item -Type Directory -Name $aName\r\nGet-Process | Out-File -Path \"C:\\Users\\Test\\Documents\\$aName\\LongFile.txt\"\r\n\r\n#On the 'local' machine that you are trying to move/copy files with\r\n$aName = \"a\"*255\r\nCopy-Item -Path \\\\ComputerName\\C$\\Users\\Documents\\$aName\\ -Destination C:\\Users\\Test2\\Documents\\CopyTarget -Recurse -Force\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nFiles from the UNC Path are copied to the CopyTarget folder\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nNo files are copied over and the command errors out on the path that exceeds 255 characters. If there are other folders and files that do not exceed 255 character paths, they will successfully be copied.\r\n```\r\nCopy-Item : Cannot find path '\\\\ComputerName\\C$\\Users\\Test\\Documents\\aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\r\naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa\\' because it does not e\r\nxist.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Copy-Item -Path \"\\\\ComputerName\\C$\\Users\\Test\\Documents\\$ ...\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (\\\\ComputerName...aaaaaaaaaaaaaa\\:String) [Copy-Item], ItemNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.CopyItemCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 6.1.7601 S\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

I don't know nearly enough about the inner workings of Core to make an educated guess and would appreciate the info!\r\n\r\nI've also just duplicated the behavior on my Win 10 machine after setting that reg key.
