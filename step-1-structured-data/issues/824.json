  "body": "## Move to GitHub\n\nThis issue tracks problems we faced, when we tried to move development.\nIt's divide into buckets.\n#### Source parity\n\nThere are two parts: we cannot build some code as-is (i.e. we need `#if !CORECLR` guards), we don't build some things yet (completely or replaced with stubs)\n- [x] #760  Replace Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.Native by the real package on Full CLR build\n- [x] ~~#745 Use C# bindings in EventLog code~~ (out of scope)\n- [x] ~~#726 Replace FlashExtract sources by Nuget packages~~ (out of scope)\n- [x] #683 FullCLR version should build x64 powershell.exe\n- [x] ~~#670 Add controlpanelitemcommand.cs to Full CLR build~~ (out of scope)\n- [x] ~~Submit `#if !CORECLR` guards and `<windows.h>` (from powershell.exe) to our current branch in source depot~~\n- [ ] We don't build all existing in the product artifacts. #1031\n#### Process problems\n- [x] ResGen is missing from `dotnet cli` (we workaround it with `Start-ResGen` + submodule, but it complicates the process). \n- [x] It's pretty hard to maintain two long-living branches at the current state of the repo: massive re-namings need to be carry-around as cherry-picks. It would be viable, when structure would settle better.\n#### Regressions in the GitHub binaries\n- [ ] #543 BVT/DRT Regressions\n- [x] #547 New-Object -Com doesn't work for custom Com objects\n- [ ] BVT/DRT run for binaries from the proposed branch [`server2016-old`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/tree/server2016-old) is not clean.\n- [x] We use artificially crafted NuGet packages as dependencies from local [`nuget-feed`](https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-windows-build/tree/master/nuget-feed). It allows us to build binaries, but they are failed to load from GAC in runtime.\n",
