Set the configuration flag System.Globalization.Invariant to true if you want to run with no globalization support.\r\n\r\n   at System.Environment.FailFast(System.String)\r\n   at System.Globalization.GlobalizationMode.GetGlobalizationInvariantMode()\r\n   at System.Globalization.GlobalizationMode..cctor()\r\n   at System.Globalization.CultureData.CreateCultureWithInvariantData()\r\n   at System.Globalization.CultureData.get_Invariant()\r\n   at System.Globalization.CultureInfo..cctor()\r\n   at System.StringComparer..cctor()\r\n   at System.AppDomain.InitializeCompatibilityFlags()\r\n   at System.AppDomain.Setup(System.Object)\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed in [dotnet core setup](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/4413) so I hope it can be ported into PS.\r\n\r\nThanks.",
