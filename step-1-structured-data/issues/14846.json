  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Start pwsh\r\n2. We get the note: `A new PowerShell stable release is available: v7.1.0 - Upgrade now, or check out the release page at: \u2026`\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n3. Why does PowerShell nut just tell how the upgrade can be done?\r\n4. I expect a Message like **Just call `pwsh install-upgrade`**\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nIt's **very** annoying and therefore a really dangerous security issue: user's don't spend 15 minutes until they get the answer.\r\n1. Users probably start reading the release note. There is no answer how the upgrade must be installed :-(\r\n2. Users must start asking google :-(\r\n3. We find the M$ Docs: **[Installing PowerShell on Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-windows?view=powershell-7.1)** - **the proposal is a shame and a nightmare:** _\"For best results when upgrading, you should use the same install method you used when you first installed PowerShell.\"_ Does anyone remember how he initially installed PowerShell?? I don't because it should _never_ be important.\r\n4. Users are forced to spend additional time to ask google for a useful solution. Of course, it should be professional, e.g. state of the PowerShell scripting art.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
