  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces all occurrences of `PsUtils.GetMainModule(currentProcess).FileName` with the new `Environment.ProcessPath` API as suggested in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/14332#issuecomment-739549844.\r\nFurthermore, all the other places in which a ProcessModule needs to be retrieved have been changed to use `Process.MainModule` .NET API directly instead of going through `PSUtils.GetMainModule` (which has been removed).\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nIn the comment linked above, @iSazonov reported that calling `PsUtils.GetMainModule(currentProcess).FileName` was particularly expensive (27ms). The new `Environment.ProcessPath` API has been implemented to tackle this problem and there is even an official .NET analyzer to recommend switching to it (https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers/pull/4909).\r\nWhile making that change, I noticed that `PSUtils.GetMainModule` wrapped `Process.MainModule` in a retry loop to workaround a .NET Framework 2.0 (!) BCL issue, therefore it shouldn't be needed at all nowadays.\r\n\r\nFixes #13790\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.
