  "body": "Windows tests currently support running as `-Unelevated` (since Windows tests always expect to be initiated as elevated).  We should consider something similar for non-Windows.  It could be as simple as running the tests under sudo, creating non-root account and running the tests under that account.  However, I'm concerned about requiring tests to be run under `sudo` all the time.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update [docs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/WritingPesterTests.md#admin-privileges-in-tests)\r\n\r\ncc @JamesWTruher ",
