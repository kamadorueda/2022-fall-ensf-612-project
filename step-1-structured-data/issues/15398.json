      "body": "I feel like this just adds more work for little gain, the best thing to do is to not create a function that shadows a native command. This is usually not a problem if you follow the `Verb-Noun` syntax that is encouraged in PowerShell. If you do have a shadow then you need to explicitly invoke the command like `&(Get-Command foo -CommandType Application)`.",
