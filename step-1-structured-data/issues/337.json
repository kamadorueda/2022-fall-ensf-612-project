We previously did because we were doing the UTF 8 to UTF 16 conversion in the native code, and so had to explicitly check that we started with UTF 8. However, we are now utilizing .NET Core better, so it does the conversion automatically during marshaling. Since we only support platforms supported by .NET Core, this explicit check should probably be removed.  VSO create date - 11/6/2015 14:17:00     VSO closed date - 12/1/2015 15:43:00     \n",
