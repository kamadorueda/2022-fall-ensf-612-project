  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAfter installing PowerShell 7 on Server 2016, when users (both regular users and admins) go to view volume shadow copies of a folder for a specific date by going to Properties > Previous Versions, pressing the \u2018Open\u2019 button opens a blank PowerShell 7 window in the location of the shadow copy (\\\\\\server\\share\\\\@timestamp\\folder) instead of opening the folder in File Explorer. Opening the folder by double-clicking on the listed folder opens it normally in File Explorer. I\u2019ve run Process Monitor to attempt to narrow down the issue, and I can see Explorer launching the pwsh.exe process, but I wasn\u2019t able to obtain much other useful information.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPressing 'Open' in the Previous Versions list with a folder selected should open the selected folder in File Explorer instead of opening a PowerShell 7 console window.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPressing the \u2018Open\u2019 button in the Previous Versions list with a folder selected opens a blank PowerShell 7 window in the location of the shadow copy (\\\\server\\share\\@timestamp\\folder) instead of opening the folder in File Explorer. Opening the folder by double-clicking on the listed folder opens it normally in File Explorer.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nThere is no error message, just unexpected behavior.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.14393\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\nUnable to post screenshots, as they contain specific UNC paths and server names.",
