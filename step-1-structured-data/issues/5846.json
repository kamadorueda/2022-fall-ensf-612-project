The final version will be `6.0.0-1` which is alphabetically behind all the current prerelease versions so `apt install powershell` installs rc2 instead of final.\r\n\r\nThe convention for prerelease versioning is taken from http://gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=install_unstable&cat=install\r\n\r\nsame for RPMs https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package_naming_guidelines",

      "body": "@chuanjiao10 it's not that simple.  We've already removed the prerelease pkgs from packages.microsoft.com, but there is caching going on.  Also for the RPM, if you have RC2 installed, it thinks that's newer so by default doesn't allow you to install 6.0.0.  Current plan is to re-release 6.0.0 as 6.0.1 which should resolve this issue.",

For example, sssd-1.8.0beta2.tar.gz is defined to be \u201c1.7.92\u201d. Use Version: 1.7.92 (in .spec file).\r\n\r\nSo for PowerShell Core 6.1.0 GA we could use the scheme: \"unreal\" version starting with 10000 - etc. 6.0.1000. We could consider 10001 - alpha1, 10002 - alfa2, 20001 - beta1, 20002 - beta2, 30001 - rc1. It allow continue use information suffixes for all package managers. \r\nIt seems the schema resolve all problems. We could easily implement it.",
