  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nI think title pretty much explains itself, but here is the idea: Have an config option in profile which allows the user to enable or disable case-sensitive tab completion. A simple filter should do.\r\n\r\nUse Case: \r\nI just want to open explorer.exe and I do this `PS> exp[-> Tab]` and this happens. \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24915107/101291721-ecf50b80-3830-11eb-956d-0f1fe1177521.png)\r\n\r\nAnd, I know adding an l should solve the problem but after years of using case-sensitive bash, it gets annoying while switching from bash to powershell. And, this has become more of a pain point since I have been using WSL regularly nowadays.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI am hoping a simple filter should do the job but I don't have the technical know-how of powershell to do it myself. If this is not released as a feature, the nudge in right direction would be great.\r\n",

PSRL (and PSES for that matter) does not receive what the engine determined to be the \"word to complete\" so it can't filter by case without duplicating a decent amount of work.\r\n\r\n",

You could write a custom `TabExpansion2` but you'd need to find the \"word to complete\" on your own.  You could probably get a sorta-good-enough version by looking at the token closest to the cursor.",
