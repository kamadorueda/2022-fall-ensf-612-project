  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI would like to pass an argument to a program, but \"Windows PowerShell\" thinks program arguments are syntax errors.\r\n\r\nNote:\r\nI actually didn't upgrade my powershell to the latest version because the link provided doesn't tell me how to do that. If you actually want me to upgrade tell me how and not to link to some release with no download-button or information on how to upgrade. I also don't know which version I am on.\r\n\r\nI also didn't search existing issues because I don't know what to search for. And searching for \"argument\" yielded 23 pages and I am not going to sift trough 23 pages.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS C:\\Users\\Redacted> \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\ssh.exe\" -V\r\nOpenSSH_8.5p1, OpenSSL 1.1.1k  25 Mar 2021\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS C:\\Users\\Redacted> \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\ssh.exe\" -V\r\nAt line:1 char:40\r\n+ \"C:\\Program Files\\Git\\usr\\bin\\ssh.exe\" -V\r\n+                                        ~~\r\nUnexpected token '-V' in expression or statement.\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnexpectedToken\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nI tried it with ', \" and without any \".\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.19041.1023\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.19041.1023\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
