      "body": "Given that I spent longer than I care to admit being tripped up by this this morning, I figure it couldn't hurt to add a comment on this issue in support of sorting it.\r\n\r\nTo my mind I see two potential courses of action:\r\n\r\n1. Make Include/Exclude and Depth mutually exclusive. Not intuitive, but at least the user will get an error rather than unexpected results.\r\n2. Adjust the cmdlet so that using these combinations of parameters works as one would expect them to.\r\n\r\nI'd say the second one is more desirable, but I'm approaching this from a high-level as a user so I don't fully appreciate the amount of work or if it would result in any breaking changes.",
