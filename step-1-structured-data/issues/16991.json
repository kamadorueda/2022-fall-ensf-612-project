  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nTake a look at this perl code:\r\n\r\n    $x = \"this is a test      123 ... this is only a test\"\r\n    $x =~ s/\"test\\s+(\\d+)\"/\"test $1\"/   \r\n    print $x\r\n    this is a test 123 ... this is only a test\r\n\r\nNotice that I match a number with regex (\\d+), it gets put into the temporary variable $1, then it gets put in the output string as an expansion of $1 temporary variable...\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do above perl replacement in powershell? I'm thinking if its possible then its something like this??\r\n\r\n    $x = \"this is a test      123 ... this is only a test\"\r\n    $x = $x -replace \"test\\s+(\\d+)\", \"test $Matches[1]\"\r\n    write-host $x\r\n    this is a test 123 ... this is only a test\r\n\r\nOf course it doesn't work... I was curious how to do this since i have a lot of perl scripts to convert to PowerShell..\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nIdeally it would be better if Powershell supported this like perl:\r\n\r\n    $x = \"this is a test      123 ... this is only a test\"\r\n    $x = $x -replace \"test\\s+(\\d+)\", \"test $1\"  \r\n    write-host $x\r\n    this is a test 123 ... this is only a test\r\n\r\n",
