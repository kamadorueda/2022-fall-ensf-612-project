  "body": "Add an extensions.json file that will prompt folks to install extensions that are recommended for this workspace (c++, c#, powershell, cmake (editing syntax) and markdown linter.\r\n\r\nAdd settings.json to start to configure C# syntax, PoweShell trim trailing whitespace and configure the markdown lint extension.\r\n\r\nUpdate launch.json to provide ability to debug PowerShell scripts.\r\n\r\nBTW I'm hoping as more people on the team use the VSCode extension , it will help get more attention to fixing some lingering issues in the PS extension.  Dogfooding FTW!!\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
