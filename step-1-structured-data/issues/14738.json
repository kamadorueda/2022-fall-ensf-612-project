Even if it does, don't be surprised if some built in modules break in core without the wincompat layer (though tbh about as likely to break in my experience).\r\n\r\nIf you control the environment you could edit the manifests yourself to add `Core` under `CompatiblePSEditions`.

If a Windows inbox module manifest does not include `Core` in `CompatiblePSEditions`, then PowerShell 7 will use implicit remoting with Windows PowerShell to load the module.  When this happens, all output is deserialized and the enum becomes a string.  We've worked with Windows teams to update their module manifests to include `Core` where we know it works, but those changes do not get backported to older versions of Windows.  `-SkipEditionCheck` forces `Import-Module` to load the module directly into the pwsh process.  I think the current workaround may be the best solution for now.",
