  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n`pwsh -configurationname` will take a session configuration name to restrict a PowerShell session, but depends on remoting (specifically WinRM).  It would be useful to have a `-configurationfile` to take a pssc and create a restricted session for that process.  This is not a security boundary, but could make it useful for testing configuration files and allow using them on Linux if `pwsh` is instantiated by something other than directly by the user.\r\n",
