  "body": "It updates an azure blob with an SVG and that location is referenced by the\r\nREADME.md file. TravisCI doesn't support this directly so in order to report\r\non the status of a daily test run there, we need to do this.\r\nProvide error reporting in case the badge can't be set\r\n\r\nThe location where the badge is stored in azure should be moved eventually to a global resource where we keep other azure blobs. We don't have that yet, but this will do. Also, the location in azure is globally readable, but not globally writable. Travis-CI configuration must be updated to include the two required environment variables.",
