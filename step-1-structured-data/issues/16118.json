Via sending commands to `pwsh`'s `stdin`.\r\nAnd I don't understand how I actually can be sure that command is done. \r\n\r\nBut now exactly I am trying to understand what I need to send powershel to be able to run a next command.\r\n\r\nI see that `pwsh` expects that some byte sequences will be given to it as an indication that command is done.\r\nAnd they different from time to time.\r\n\r\n`\\u{1b}[11;68R`\r\n`\\u{1b}[11;59R`\r\n`\\u{1b}[11;19R`\r\n\r\nAs I guess a line-disciple does this or this is done via your means?\r\n\r\nTo see what I mean you can use\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/zhiburt/expectrl/pull/14\r\n\r\nand run\r\n\r\n```\r\ncargo run --example interact\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nA prompt printed after typing command + `\\r`\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nA prompt isn't printed on sending `\\r` as `ENTER`\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.4\r\nOS                             Linux 5.12.14-300.fc34.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Jun 30 18:30:21 UTC 2021\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
