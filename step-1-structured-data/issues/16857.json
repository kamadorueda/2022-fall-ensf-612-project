  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a contributor to a Markdown wiki repo, I would like to be able to (cleanly) parse [YAML frontmatter](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#extension-yaml_metadata_block) blocks in PowerShell via `ConvertFrom-Markdown`.\r\n\r\nWhile there's a workaround available by manually extracting the HeaderBlock from parsed tokens and feeding its inline content to a YAML parser, this is very counterintuitive. Moreover, YAML frontmatter is rendered to HTML in the generated document, which isn't ideal either. (Normally, Markdig suppresses HTML generation for these tokens).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThis is already a native feature of Markdig, so it should be as easy as calling [`.UseYamlFrontMatter()`](https://atashbahar.com/post/2020-06-16-extract-front-matter-in-dotnet-with-markdig) on `MarkdownPipelineBuilder` before `.Build()`.\r\n\r\nGiven that these are essentially document properties, a property added to `[Microsoft.PowerShell.MarkdownRender.MarkdownInfo]` instances that extracts YAML frontmatter (if present) and deserializes to a CLR object would likely be the most sensible to use.",
