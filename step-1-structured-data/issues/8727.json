I did test interactively, and the reply-to field was correctly populated in an e-mail message, but even the existing Pester tests won't run on my development box since they're hard-coded to run only on Linux.\r\n\r\nIf I'm reading correctly, it looks like the existing tests actually call a mail server running on the local machine to send a message, and then they read the message back from disk. Could someone with easy access to a Linux device help with Pester tests?",
