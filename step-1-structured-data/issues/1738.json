  "body": "- [x] Resolves issue #1033 .\n- [x] Code is [rebased](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/git/README.md#sync-your-local-repo) on `origin/master`.\n\nAccording to Joey's latest update, the decision made by lawyer is like following:\n\nBasically, there's Windows PowerShell (which is FullCLR based) and PowerShell Core (which is CoreCLR based and works on Windows, Mac, Nano, Linux). The former, Windows PowerShell, should still say Windows PowerShell. The latter, PowerShell Core, should just say PowerShell\nAnd all of them should keep the copyright\n\nPlease add Joey for review as well.\n",
