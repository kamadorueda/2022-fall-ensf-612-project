  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHave installed PowerShell 7 on a number of client machines with the aim of using PS7 for remoting instead of Windows PowerShell 5.1.\r\n\r\nPart of a larger script:\r\n```ps\r\n$s = New-PSSession -ComputerName $compName -Credential $cred\r\nInvoke-Command -Session $s -ScriptBlock { Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned }\r\nInvoke-Command -Session $s -FilePath .\\PSRemoteSetup.ps1\r\n```\r\nContents of PSRemoteSetup.ps1:\r\n```ps\r\nSet-Location -Path 'C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\'\r\n.\\Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 -PowerShellHome 'C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\'\r\n```\r\nWorks on every computer so far, but triggers a PSRemotingTransportException\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nShould terminate remote session connection quietly or notify that command executed successfully\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nSession terminates with an error\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nOriginInfo            : NUM5-STORES\r\nException             :\r\n    Type             : System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSRemotingTransportException\r\n    ErrorCode        : 995\r\n    TransportMessage : The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an\r\napplication request.\r\n    ErrorRecord      :\r\n        Exception             :\r\n            Type    : System.Management.Automation.ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n            Message : Processing data from remote server NUM5-STORES failed with the following error      \r\nmessage: The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request.    \r\nFor more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.\r\n            HResult : -2146233087\r\n        CategoryInfo          : ResourceUnavailable: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n        FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSRemotingDataStructureException    \r\n    Message          : Processing data from remote server NUM5-STORES failed with the following error     \r\nmessage: The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request.    \r\n        CategoryInfo          : ResourceUnavailable: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n        FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.Management.Automation.Remoting.PSRemotingDataStructureException    \r\n    Message          : Processing data from remote server NUM5-STORES failed with the following error     \r\nmessage: The I/O operation has been aborted because of either a thread exit or an application request.    \r\nFor more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.\r\n    HResult          : -2146233087\r\nTargetObject          : NUM5-STORES\r\nCategoryInfo          : OperationStopped: (NUM5-STORES:String) [], PSRemotingTransportException\r\nFullyQualifiedErrorId : JobFailure\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "I believe the problem here is running `Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1` inside an actual PSSession. IIRC this particular step will bounce the WinRM service killing any existing connections thus leading to your error. It's the same with registering a JEA configuration as both call [Register-PSSessionConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-pssessionconfiguration?view=powershell-7.2). If you need to run this remotely you would either need to try and ignore the error or run it independently of WinRM. What I mean by that is to run it using a different transport (like SSH, PSExec, etc) or run it inside some kind of background task after you've exited the session (`Invoke-CimMethod Win32_Process Create`).",
