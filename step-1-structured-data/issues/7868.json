  "body": "`Format-Hex`'s `-Raw` switch is obsolete in PowerShell Core - it has no effect whatsoever and is only retained for backward compatibility with Windows PowerShell v5.1 (backstory [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/3320)).\r\n\r\n(As an aside: This fact is [not documented](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/1940),  nor was the parameter's (fairly obscure) original purpose ever documented for v5.1.)\r\n\r\nExplaining the obsolescence in the documentation will go a long way, but I wonder if there is/should be a mechanism to _hide_ a parameter from the _syntax diagram_, so that its continued, pointless presence doesn't cause confusion / isn't a distraction when you run `Format-Hex -?` or `Get-Command Format-Hex -Syntax`, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWritten as of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 6.1.0\r\n```\r\n",

Going forward all of the output will be displayed with a true representation of numbers that includes all of the bytes for its type (what the Raw parameter was formally doing). For example, [Int32]170 passed to Format-Hex would have previously displayed only \"AA\". Now it will display \"AA 00 00 00\".",
