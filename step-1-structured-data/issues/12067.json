  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a part-time Linux user, I am used to using `whereis`.  I would like an alias for` Get-Command` to whereis in PowerShell. Currently, no `whereis` alias is available.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8278033/76146556-0d224f00-6094-11ea-8d1a-9d99d95015c5.png)\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nConsidering I use about 10 commands in Linux and most of them have already been aliased in PowerShell since the early days, I would like to create a PR to add this alias to PowerShell itself.\r\n\r\nOh, that's not very technical, but basically I'd read the source code for other Linux-based aliases, and modify for `whereis` to `Get-Command` and assume I must have agreement first.\r\n",

      "body": "While there's been quite a bit of opposition to adding some aliases that collide with Linux in the past... I think this makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nGet-Command can and will find both native utilities as well as PowerShell commands, so despite overshadowing the builtin `whereis` alias, I think this would largely end up being an enhancement of it, rather than a detractor.",

      "body": "IMHO it's so easy to ship and sync your user profile around that this should stay in the realm of a profile alias. You can also always ship a module that adds tons of aliases and completers, but I think keeping the surface area of the core of powershell small and lean on existing available extensibility is the right move here.

My personal and professional relationship with them started to degrade when product activation was introduced. Then someday they didn't want me as a tester anymore...
