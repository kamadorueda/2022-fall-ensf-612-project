  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\nCreate a PowerShell container(mcr.microsoft.com/powershell:7.1.0-debian-buster-slim) in AKS\r\n\r\nRun following command in container\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstall-Module -Name PSWSMan -Force\r\nInstall-WSMan\r\n\r\n$username = 'admin@test.onmicrosoft.com'\r\n$password = '***********'\r\n$secure = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force\r\n$credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential($username, $secure)\r\n$session = New-PSSession -Credential $credential -ConfigurationName \"Microsoft.Exchange\" -ConnectionUri \"https://ps.compliance.protection.outlook.com/powershell-liveid/\" -Authentication Basic -AllowRedirection\r\nImport-PSSession $session -CommandName Get-Label\r\nGet-Label\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe get following error\r\n`OperationStopped: Starting a command on the remote server failed with the following error message : ERROR_WSMAN_INVALID_SELECTORS: The WS-Management service cannot process the request because the request contained invalid selectors for the resource.  For more information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic.`\r\n\r\n1 The error only occurs in an AKS which behinds Azure Firewall, it works in other AKS, works in container of Azure VM.\r\n2 If we execute Get-Label multiple times, it doesn't always error, it may work too.\r\n\r\nThe powershell is 7.1, any way we can take to troubleshooting this?",

      "body": "Looks like you are using the fork of OMI, you should raise that issue at https://github.com/jborean93/omi as that's where the code lies and not in PowerShell. I can't guarantee I will be able to get to this anytime soon, I would have a look at the logging information https://github.com/jborean93/omi#troubleshooting to try and get some more info and share that in the request.\r\n\r\nIf you do post an issue there it would also be good to know if this works from Windows. I never used AKS before so it will be quite difficult for me to test this out.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/8462645?s=400&v=4\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/jborean93/omi\">jborean93/omi</a></strong></div><div>Open Management Infrastructure.
