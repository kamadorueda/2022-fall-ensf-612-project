      "body": "My understanding is superficial, but here's a few pointers:\r\n\r\n* There appears to be a macOS system API that limits process (executable) names to 15 characters (which affects calls such as `pgrep -l com.apple.CharacterPicker`). However, this limitation _can_ be overcome, as evidenced by the output from the native `ps` utility: `ps -Ac` shows the executable names without truncation.\r\n\r\n* It is [`System.Diagnostics.Process`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.Diagnostics.Process) that reports the truncated name, so PowerShell is only the messenger here, so I suggest closing this issue and opening one at https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues\r\n\r\nSeparately, an improvement worth considering is to show the whole _command line_ as part of the default output formatting, not just the process name - the way the native `ps` utility already does. This would require opening a separate issue of type \"Feature Request / Idea\"; also, the `.CommandLine` property doesn't currently work on macOS: see #13943.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@mklement0 has it correct, this is an issue with the underlying `dotnet` API. Which can be seen here:\r\n```\r\n[System.Diagnostics.Process]::GetProcesses().foreach({$_.Name.Length})|measure -max\r\n\r\nCount             : 600\r\nAverage           : \r\nSum               : \r\nMaximum           : 15\r\nMinimum           : \r\nStandardDeviation : \r\nProperty          : \r\n```\r\nFurther, there are a number of other issues specifically with `get-process` on mac. A number of process names _cannot_ be reported because the caller does not have privilege. FWIW, on Mac `ps` is `setuid root` which why you can see them from `/bin/ps`\r\n\r\nFrom my perspective, this (the name truncation) is an external issue which should be addressed in the dotnet layer",
