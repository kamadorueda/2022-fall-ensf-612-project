  "body": "Being able to create symlinks using relative paths is an important feature that both the `ln` utility on Unix and cmd's built-in command `mklink` on Windows support.\r\n\r\nCurrently, PowerShell invariably resolves the specified path to an _absolute path_ when a symlink is created.\r\n(#801 brought us the ability to create symlinks to non-existing targets,  but even they are invariably resolved to an absolute path when the symlink is created).\r\n\r\nInstead, the symlink should be defined with the target path _exactly as specified_.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce (Unix)\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$null = New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink /tmp/$PID -Target ./foo -Force\r\nreadlink /tmp/$PID\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n./foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe symlink should be defined with the target path exactly as specified.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```\r\n/Users/jdoe/foo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe symlink was unexpectedly defined with an absolute path.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-alpha (v6.0.0-alpha.17) on Darwin Kernel Version 16.5.0: Fri Mar  3 16:52:33 PST 2017; root:xnu-3789.51.2~3/RELEASE_X86_64\r\n```\r\n",

I just ran into this issue and I must say, in _most_ scenarios that I have so far encountered (e.g. symlinks in git repositories) **absolute** symlinks are not exactly very helpful.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, I can still work around the issue by calling out to `cmd /C mklink /D mylink .\\mytarget` but this really seems like a fairly fundamental flaw in the cmdlet.",
