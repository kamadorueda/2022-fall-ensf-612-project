  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nImproving the speed of this function will encourage people to use it over the CIM / WMI alternates. Currently this takes 3 seconds to run on my laptop, regardless of how I filter it to restrict results to smaller pieces of info (eg just total memory) whereas if I use Get-CIMInstance CIM_PhysicalMemory it takes 83ms\r\n\r\n",
