      "body": "@brad-charboneau the WMI commands have been deprecated since v3 of Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThis functionality is provided via the CIM cmdlets in both Windows PowerShell v3+ and PowerShell 6+. \ud83d\ude42 \r\n\r\nMost commands using `Get-WmiObject` can be changed to `Get-CimInstance` with minimal or zero modification to the command parameters. Some more complex workflows may need a bit more attention, but by and large the CIM cmdlets are a more effective and faster replacement for the WMI cmdlets. \ud83d\ude42 ",
