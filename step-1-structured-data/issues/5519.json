While this is certainly not the intended behavior of the new `[char]` overload for `..`, it doesn't seem to break any previously defined behavior (this is basically the expected behavior for `$string..$otherstring` prior to https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/5026)\r\n\r\nRe: the \"nonstandard\" name, I took it from the [token](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/4bc52d2358222084738157a08907fac32d13bd3a/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/token.cs#L181) that represents the underlying range operator :-) \r\n",

Perhaps it's time for the \"asterisk multiplication operator\", or the \"hyphen-minus subtraction operator\", and, last but not least, the \"dot-dot range operator\".",
