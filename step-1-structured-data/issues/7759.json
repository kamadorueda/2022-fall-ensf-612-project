At first I thought this is a problem in AWS Tool for Powershell, but I realized that it resides on the Powershell loading modules and not AWS SDK library. \r\n\r\nI noticed this issue while making a linux docker image using powershell, but same issue were reported by AWS engineer using OS X also. \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n1) Install powershell on Linux\r\n2) Install AWS Tools for Powershell\r\n3) Launch powershell and try *some* commands like `Copy-S3Object`, `Get-IAMRole` (not `Get-IAMRoles`)\r\n\r\nStep 2) can be\r\n```bash\r\npwsh -command \"& {&'Install-Module' -Name AWSPowerShell.NetCore -AllowClobber -Force}\"\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```bash\r\npwsh -command \"& {&'Install-Module' -Scope CurrentUser -Name AWSPowerShell.NetCore -Force}\"\r\n```\r\nor any command that installs the module, even on running powershell.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nThe aws module should be loaded and handle AWS commands without explicit import\r\n```none\r\nPS /> Get-S3Object\r\n\r\ncmdlet Get-S3Object at command pipeline position 1\r\nSupply values for the following parameters:\r\nBucketName:\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS /> Get-S3Object\r\nGet-S3Object : The term 'Get-S3Object' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Get-S3Object\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (Get-S3Object:String) [], CommandNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.4\r\nOS                             Linux 4.9.93-linuxkit-aufs #1 SMP Wed Jun 6 16:55:56 UTC 2018\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote\r\n----------------\r\nWhat makes me confused more is,\r\n- When I type `Get-IAM` then press `Tab`, it shows\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /> Get-IAM\r\nGet-IAMAccountAuthorizationDetails  Get-IAMAttachedRolePolicies         Get-IAMGroupPolicies                Get-IAMInstanceProfiles             Get-IAMPolicies                     Get-IAMRolePolicies                 Get-IAMSAMLProviders                Get-IAMUserPolicies\r\nGet-IAMAttachedGroupPolicies        Get-IAMAttachedUserPolicies         Get-IAMGroups                       Get-IAMOpenIDConnectProviders       Get-IAMPolicyVersions               Get-IAMRoles                        Get-IAMServerCertificates           Get-IAMUsers\r\n```\r\n- At this point, `Get-IAMRole` does not work. But `Get-IAMRoles` works.\r\n- After typing `Get-IAMRoles`, it loads aws module, so autocomplete works fine. So now `Get-IAMRole` works\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /> Get-IAMRole\r\nGet-IAMRole : The term 'Get-IAMRole' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Get-IAMRole\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (Get-IAMRole:String) [], CommandNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException\r\n\r\nPS /> Get-IAMRoles\r\nGet-IAMRoles : No credentials specified or obtained from persisted/shell defaults.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Get-IAMRoles\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (Amazon.PowerShe...MRoleListCmdlet:GetIAMRoleListCmdlet) [Get-IAMRoleList], InvalidOperationException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidOperationException,Amazon.PowerShell.Cmdlets.IAM.GetIAMRoleListCmdlet\r\n\r\nPS /> Get-IAMRole\r\nGet-IAMRole : No credentials specified or obtained from persisted/shell defaults.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Get-IAMRole\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : InvalidOperation: (Amazon.PowerShe...etIAMRoleCmdlet:GetIAMRoleCmdlet) [Get-IAMRole], InvalidOperationException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidOperationException,Amazon.PowerShell.Cmdlets.IAM.GetIAMRoleCmdlet\r\n```\r\n- Now, repeat typing `Get-IAM` then press `Tab`,\r\n```powershell\r\nPS /> Get-IAM\r\nGet-IAMAccessKey                        Get-IAMAttachedRolePolicies             Get-IAMGroupForUser                     Get-IAMInstanceProfiles                 Get-IAMPolicyVersion                    Get-IAMSAMLProvider                     Get-IAMSSHPublicKey\r\nGet-IAMAccessKeyLastUsed                Get-IAMAttachedRolePolicyList           Get-IAMGroupList                        Get-IAMLoginProfile                     Get-IAMPolicyVersionList                Get-IAMSAMLProviderList                 Get-IAMSSHPublicKeyList\r\nGet-IAMAccountAlias                     Get-IAMAttachedUserPolicies             Get-IAMGroupPolicies                    Get-IAMMFADevice                        Get-IAMPolicyVersions                   Get-IAMSAMLProviders                    Get-IAMUser\r\nGet-IAMAccountAuthorizationDetail       Get-IAMAttachedUserPolicyList           Get-IAMGroupPolicy                      Get-IAMOpenIDConnectProvider            Get-IAMRole                             Get-IAMServerCertificate                Get-IAMUserList\r\nGet-IAMAccountAuthorizationDetails      Get-IAMContextKeysForCustomPolicy       Get-IAMGroupPolicyList                  Get-IAMOpenIDConnectProviderList        Get-IAMRoleList                         Get-IAMServerCertificateList            Get-IAMUserPolicies\r\nGet-IAMAccountPasswordPolicy            Get-IAMContextKeysForPrincipalPolicy    Get-IAMGroups                           Get-IAMOpenIDConnectProviders           Get-IAMRolePolicies                     Get-IAMServerCertificates               Get-IAMUserPolicy\r\nGet-IAMAccountSummary                   Get-IAMCredentialReport                 Get-IAMInstanceProfile                  Get-IAMPolicies                         Get-IAMRolePolicy                       Get-IAMServiceLinkedRoleDeletionStatus  Get-IAMUserPolicyList\r\nGet-IAMAttachedGroupPolicies            Get-IAMEntitiesForPolicy                Get-IAMInstanceProfileForRole           Get-IAMPolicy                           Get-IAMRolePolicyList                   Get-IAMServiceSpecificCredentialList    Get-IAMUsers\r\nGet-IAMAttachedGroupPolicyList          Get-IAMGroup                            Get-IAMInstanceProfileList              Get-IAMPolicyList                       Get-IAMRoles                            Get-IAMSigningCertificate               Get-IAMVirtualMFADevice\r\n```\r\nIt seems having some problem on automatically loading some modules.

This caused the gallery publishing to reject the module as it limited modules to under 4000 cmdlets in the export statement. We considered listing only 'the most important' cmdlets but couldn't come up with a single list - every service seemed to be important to someone :-). In the face of this, switching back to wildcards and noting the issue in the release notes at the time seemed the best approach.\r\n\r\nNow, we realize 4000+ cmdlets is a lot - and the growth in service APIs since we shipped v1.0 has surprised us too. We have backlog plans to re-modularize to per-service modules but have not yet been able to schedule the work. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, reverting to wildcards actually improved the import time for the module too - which now that we have PowerShell support in Lambda we're not too keen on making worse either. Realistically I think a fix will need to wait until we can get the re-modularization work scheduled. I'll bring this discussion to the wider attention of the team here at AWS and see what we can do to bump the priority.",

You're effectively running `Import-Module $module; Get-Command -Module $module`, so if you don't need the output of `Get-Command`, then just simply run `Import-Module`.\r\n\r\nIn fact, running Import-Module is significantly faster than running Get-Command and piping to Out-Null due to no pipeline output that needs to subsequently be squashed:\r\n\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\"Get-Command time: {0}\" -f (Measure-Command {\r\n    pwsh -noprofile -C \"Get-Command -Module AWSPowerShell.NetCore | Out-Null\"\r\n}).ToString()\r\n\"Import-Module time: {0}\" -f (Measure-Command {\r\n    pwsh -noprofile -C \"Import-Mdule AWSPowerShell.NetCore\"\r\n}).ToString()\r\n\r\n# Output:\r\nGet-Command time: 00:00:06.7730225\r\nImport-Module time: 00:00:00.8841475\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

I don't profess to understand what's going on under the hood, and the results did seem odd, but we didn't have time to properly investigate (a speedup is a speedup). I'm a C# developer, and I'll freely admit PowerShell performance isn't something I've worked on a lot, so always happy to learn. We'll reinvestigate the performance once we've deployed the initial version, and see what we can do.",
