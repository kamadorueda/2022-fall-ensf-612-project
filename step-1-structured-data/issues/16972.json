  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nPassing multiple processes to `Wait-Process` currently makes the latter wait for _all_ target processes.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is sometimes desirable to only wait for _any one_ of these processes to terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n* Introduce an `-Any` switch that makes `Wait-Process` return as soon as any _one_ of the target processes terminates.\r\n\r\n* Complement it with a `-PassThru` switch to pass a process-info object(s) for the terminated process(es) through - this should work whether or not `-Any` is used.\r\n\r\n",

I'll see if I can get this on the agenda for the cmdlet working group next time we meet (the group only met last week and I loused up my calendar and missed that one) . It will probably end up as up for grabs rather than getting team resource but we'll see where it goes. \r\n",
