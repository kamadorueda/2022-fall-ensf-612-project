  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nWhen PowerShell replaced cmd.exe, the old `xcopy` command was lost.  Oh, it still works, but doesn't run natively.  We have `Copy-Item`, but it doesn't preserve the directory structure.  All files are simply copied to the destination folder rather than several folders down.  To me, a simple switch solves that problem.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
