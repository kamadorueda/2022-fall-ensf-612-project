  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nIf it is a bug report:\r\n- make sure you are able to repro it on the latest released version. \r\nYou can install the latest version from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](../docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](../docs/KNOWNISSUES.md).\r\n- Fill out the following repro template\r\n\r\nIf it's not a bug, please remove the template and elaborate the issue in your own words.\r\n-->\r\nWhen using both the console host and an editor like VSCode, completions are provided for\r\nenvironment variables that differ across platforms. In the case of VSCode, I know it tries to\r\nmake recommendations for scripts that help them work cross-platform, and this seems to\r\nfit in that category. Of course, plenty of environment variables are just not cross-platform, but\r\nfor things like `$env:PSModulePath` that come with PowerShell, it would make sense.\r\n\r\nGiven that Linux requires variable names that Windows tolerates but no vice-versa, perhaps we\r\nshould prefer those?\r\n\r\nI wouldn't necessarily characterise this as a bug, but it might help obviate some bugs if changed. See #2937 and #2677. I know I have personally run into this when tests I wrote failed because I used\r\n`$env:PSModulePath`, my reasoning being that the completion of a variable name would be the\r\ncanonical name for the variable.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nIn a PowerShell terminal or editor with completions enter the input:\r\n```powershell\r\n$env:PSM<Tab>\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nThe same completed variable name across platforms.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nOn Windows:\r\n```powershell\r\n$env:PSModulePath\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Linux:\r\n```powershell\r\n$env:PSMODULEPATH\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value                                                                                                 \r\n----                           -----                                                                                                 \r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.16-28-g136213d6b4767370f0b6340ffbefa130fdc55327                                          \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                   \r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                               \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                                                                                  \r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0                                                                                               \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                   \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                                                                               \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha                                                                                           \r\nCLRVersion                                                                                                                           \r\n```\r\n",
