  "body": "Addresses #3792 \r\n\r\nThe code paths deleted where  using the undocumented API on WIn8 and newer for the following purposes:\r\n* Faster filtering\r\n* Getting two properties (left empty on Win7 and below)\r\n* Logging using Certificate components when a cert is deleted or copied.\r\n\r\nAfter the change, all the code uses public APIs.  Filtering is done in PowerShell using existing code.  I don't believe the logging is needed.\r\n",
