  "body": "Two problems were encountered:\n\n1: mc.exe was not found under program files (x86)\\Microsoft SDKs\\Windows.\nThis was worked around via disabling mc.exe discovery: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/dce4bad9d0c15e721ed8b1af0c524883ca10c3a8\n\n2: mscoree.h was not found\nThe netfx SDK 4.6 is needed to resolve this header.\n\nBoth can be addressed via installing the Windows 10 SDK (choco install windows-sdk-10.0 /y); however, build.psm1 still needs to be updated to correctly detect mc.exe when it is needed.\n",
