  "body": "Hi, I started using Powershell add-computer script to join my PCs to the domain and I quickly found out, rather painfully, is that the command will replace the GUID in AD so if another PC already exists in AD, it will replace it and I suddenly get a broken PC in AD that the users were using. Why?\r\n\r\nSo to make it harder, I am using MDT to mass deploy images and as such, I can not install RSAT on every workstation to get the AD powershell module installed in Powershell. Can anyone please recommend a method to prevent my imaging to pop existing PCs in AD using MDT or if there is a way to tell the function to not change existing PCs?\r\n\r\n",
