  "body": "Unlike the filesystem which all the files and directories already exist in our system, SHiPS Azure provider initially does not have any data in the local system to search for . When a user is navigating around, it reaches out to Azure for fetching data and builds up the navigation tree.  In the SHiPS case, when a user cd and then tab, or get-azurerm tab, the progress bar shows up while fetching data. After write-progress completes,  it lefts a large spaces.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10171679/41133134-f8676f9e-6a79-11e8-8f77-70d269b495a6.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial Analysis\r\n---------\r\nBoth the PowerShell and PSReadline are contributing to this issue.  PowerShell does not set the cursor to the place where it starts while  the PSReadline does not update the cursor position in case the screen has been scrolled up for displaying progress messages.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nportal.azure.com\r\nselect bash\r\ntype pwsh\r\ncd tab\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nAfter write-progress completes the cursor should be the initial command line place, in this case \"cd\".\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nLeft lots of spaces used for showing progress bar.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.1.0-preview.2\r\nand \r\nPSReadLine 2.0.0-Beta.1 or PSReadLine 2.0.0-Beta.2\r\n\r\n",
