  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Install latest version of Fedora\r\n2. Download the latest powershell rpm\r\n3. double-click on the rpm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nGNOME-Software should not say the package is proprietary.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nGNOME-Software will say the package is proprietary.\r\nActually it's MIT-licensed, which qualifies as free software.\r\n\r\nThis confuses users, and might discourage some users from adopting powershell.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nThe reason for this is the license field of the official RPM says \"MIT License\".\r\nIt should be \"MIT\" instead, which is a valid SPDX License Identifier (\"MIT License\" is not).\r\n\r\n```\r\nSee: https://github.com/ximion/appstream/issues/359\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nN/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
