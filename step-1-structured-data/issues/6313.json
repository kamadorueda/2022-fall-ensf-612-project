      "body": "The way `-Wrap` works is that it tries not to split a word.  So in the second case above (w/ latest master), the wrap inserts a newline after the first `'d' * 100` since it fits, but puts the second one on a new line rather than split it.  In the first case, the tab character's display size isn't taken into account, so it treats it as size 1.  `'d' * 200` is wider than the width of the console, so it has to split it in half, but due to the wrong total length calculation of the tab, it inserts the newline in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nNot sure how to fix this for all cases.  On macOS, the default tab stop is 8, so ``a`tb`` would show \"a\\<seven spaces\\>b\".  However you can use `tabs -4` to change the tab stop to 4 or even set different sizes for tab stop 1, 2, ... so we can't make assumptions about the tab stops.\r\n\r\nI suppose one option is when using `format-table -wrap`, we convert the tabs to four spaces.\r\n",
