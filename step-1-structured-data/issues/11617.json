  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<sup>Related: #11607</sup>\r\n\r\nPS Core added the ability to pass calculated properties to `Measure-Object -Property`  - see #6855\r\n\r\nHowever, the current implementation is inconsistent with how calculated properties work in other cmdlets, such as `Select-Object` (something I originally neglected to consider):\r\n\r\n* You can only pass a _script block_, not also a _hashtable_ whose `Expression` entry contains \r\n\r\n* Since you cannot pass a hashtable, you also cannot _name_ the calculated property (key `Name` or `Label`), causing the _script block's definition text_ to appear as the `.Property` value in the output.\r\n\r\n**The only thing you can do now - pass a _script block_:**\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Count the odd numbers  in the input.\r\nPS> 1, 2, 3 | Measure-Object -Sum -Property { $_ % 2 }\r\nCount             : 3\r\nAverage           : \r\nSum               : 2\r\nMaximum           : \r\nMinimum           : \r\nStandardDeviation : \r\nProperty          :  $_ % 2    # !!\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote how `$_ % 2` - the verbatim definition of the script block - became the name of the calculated property in the output object's `.Property` value.\r\n\r\n**What you should be able to do as well: pass a _hashtable_ that gives the property a name:**\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING\r\nPS> 1, 2, 3 | Measure-Object -Sum -Property @{ Name='OddNumbers'; Expression={$_ % 2 } }\r\nCount             : 3\r\nAverage           : \r\nSum               : 2\r\nMaximum           : \r\nMinimum           : \r\nStandardDeviation : \r\nProperty          :  OddNumbers\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that this would be a safe change, because attempting to pass a hashtable currently fails.\r\n\r\n\r\nWritten as of PowerShell Core 7.0.0-rc.2.",
