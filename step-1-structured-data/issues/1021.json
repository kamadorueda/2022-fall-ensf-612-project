If you change `.RETURNVALUE` to `.OUTPUTS`, it will work correctly.\r\n\r\nThe design was to stop parsing comments as comment help when we see an unknown directive. This was a design choice meant to avoid breaking any existing scripts.\r\n\r\nThe intent was to add a script analyzer rule to warning about unknown help comment directives, but I'm not sure if such a rule exists. I do see VS Code colors the unknown directive like ordinary text, so there is a hint at least.",
