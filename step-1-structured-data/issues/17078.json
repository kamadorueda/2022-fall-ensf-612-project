Not triggered if `ArrayLiteralAst`. There are same issues other than the `Get-Command`, for example, `dir` (`Get-ChildItem`), `Get-Alias`, `Get-Module`, etc.\r\n\r\nI have fixed the condition of triggering the tab completion. It is triggered if the `lastAst` is `ErrorExpressionAst` or `ArrayLiteralAst`.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nIt helps us to modify such an array, especially when we use Alt+a key (SelectCommandArguments).\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.

      "body": "@daxian-dbw @MartinGC94 Thank you for your reply and I am sorry for my mistake. I have tested it again.\r\n\r\nIt works for the following commands:\r\n\r\n* `Get-ChildItem -Path .\\a.txt,<TAB> -Recurse`\r\n* `Get-Alias -Name gal,<TAB> -Verbose`\r\n* `Get-Module -Name PSReadLine,<TAB> -All`\r\n\r\nBut it does not work, as you say, for `Get-Command -Type Alias,<TAB> -All`.\r\n\r\nWhy? I think it is because the `-Type` parameter (alias for `-CommandType`) accepts `[System.Management.Automation.CommandTypes]` enum flags. I have noticed that all the above success cases are `[string[]]` parameter.\r\n\r\nActually, my motive in the first place is to fix `Trace-Command -Name CmdletProviderClasses,<TAB> -Expression {}`. The `-Name` is also `[string[]]`. But I mistook the PR could solve more wide range of problems including `Get-Command`.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I just care about the `,<TAB>`, not the `, <TAB>` (comma and space). The `, <TAB>` completions does not work well with or without this PR. The enum flags case and the `, <TAB>` case might need more investigation and other PRs.\r\n\r\nBased on the above, I would like to propose the following fixes:\r\n\r\n* Fix test cases: replace `Get-Command` with some commands, for example, `Get-ChildItem`\r\n* Fix PR title represent a smaller problem, for example, \"Enable completions for array parameter value just after comma without space even if other parameters follow it\"\r\n",

The only problem with a partial fix is that it causes the tab completion code to throw when you try with Enums and ideally it would never throw but throwing doesn't cause any issues as far as I know.  \r\nI would encourage you to do a full fix for the experience but if not then that's fine as well, I'll probably end up doing it if you won't \ud83d\ude01",

PRs within the\r\noptimal size (typical small, or medium sized PRs) mean:\r\n\r\n- Fast and predictable releases to production:\r\n  - Optimal size changes are more likely to be reviewed faster with fewer\r\niterations.\r\n  - Similarity in low PR complexity drives similar review times.\r\n- Review quality is likely higher as complexity is lower:\r\n  - Bugs are more likely to be detected.\r\n  - Code inconsistencies are more likely to be detetcted.\r\n- Knowledge sharing is improved within the participants:\r\n  - Small portions can be assimilated better.\r\n- Better engineering practices are exercised:\r\n  - Solving big problems by dividing them in well contained, smaller problems.\r\n  - Exercising separation of concerns within the code changes.\r\n\r\n#### What can I do to optimize my changes\r\n\r\n- Use the PullRequestQuantifier to quantify your PR accurately\r\n  - Create a context profile for your repo using the [context generator](https://github.com/microsoft/PullRequestQuantifier/releases)\r\n  - Exclude files that are not necessary to be reviewed or do not increase the review complexity. Example: Autogenerated code, docs, project IDE setting files, binaries, etc. Check out the `Excluded` section from your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile. \r\n  - Understand your typical change complexity, drive towards the desired complexity by adjusting the label mapping in your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n  - Only use the labels that matter to you, [see context specification](./docs/prquantifier-yaml.md) to customize your `prquantifier.yaml` context profile.\r\n- Change your engineering behaviors\r\n  - For PRs that fall outside of the desired spectrum, review the details and check if:\r\n    - Your PR could be split in smaller, self-contained PRs instead\r\n    - Your PR only solves one particular issue. (For example, don't refactor and code new features in the same PR).\r\n\r\n#### How to interpret the change counts in git diff output\r\n\r\n- One line was added: `+1 -0`\r\n- One line was deleted: `+0 -1`\r\n- One line was modified: `+1 -1` (git diff doesn't know about modified, it will\r\ninterpret that line like one addition plus one deletion)\r\n- Change percentiles: Change characteristics (addition, deletion, modification)\r\nof this PR in relation to all other PRs within the repository.\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<p />\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\nWas this comment helpful? <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoibWF0dDl1Y2NpIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE3MDc4IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiVGh1bWJzVXAifQ==&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs up\"><strong>:thumbsup:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoibWF0dDl1Y2NpIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE3MDc4IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiTmV1dHJhbCJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Neutral\"><strong>&nbsp;:ok_hand:</strong></a> <a href=\"https://pullrequestquantifierfeedback.azurewebsites.net/feedback?payload=eyJBdXRob3JOYW1lIjoibWF0dDl1Y2NpIiwiUmVwb3NpdG9yeUxpbmsiOiJodHRwczovL2dpdGh1Yi5jb20vUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9Qb3dlclNoZWxsIiwiUHVsbFJlcXVlc3RMaW5rIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL1Bvd2VyU2hlbGwvUG93ZXJTaGVsbC9wdWxsLzE3MDc4IiwiRXZlbnRUeXBlIjoiVGh1bWJzRG93biJ9&amp;anonymous=True\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Thumbs down\"><strong>&nbsp;:thumbsdown:</strong></a> (<a href=\"MAILTO:prquantifier@microsoft.com\" title=\"Mail to prquantifier@microsoft.com\">Email</a>)\r\n[Customize PullRequestQuantifier](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/prquantifier.yaml) for this repository.\r\n\r\n",
