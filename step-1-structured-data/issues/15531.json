  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nFor PSArm, we implemented a [completer based on the lexical context of the cursor](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSArm/blob/e22c29dfea6b2f489964d427cf0ec09270dd7d8b/src/Completion/DslCompleter.cs#L70-L127), which relied on [a way to find the current immediate parent AST of the cursor](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSArm/blob/master/src/Completion/FindAstFromPositionVisitor.cs). This then used [a generalised schema description](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSArm/blob/e22c29dfea6b2f489964d427cf0ec09270dd7d8b/src/Schema/Keyword/DslKeywordSchema.cs#L10-L21) supplied for each keyword to use to context to provide completions for parameters/arguments on that keyword as well as child keywords in the body block.\r\n\r\nNone of these techniques are specific to PSArm and for PowerShell to support DSLs better, it would be good to generalise this functionality and integrate it into PowerShell itself, ideally in a way that PowerShell can also build its own schema structure based on a declarative file format or attributes within function definitions.",
