      "body": "I too got quite a shock when I first extracted a release tarball and had it spew files everywhere in the current directory. That's a really bad first impression. What's perhaps even more shocking is that something so simple to fix has been an issue for almost three years, and yet the project doesn't seem dead based on commit history.\r\n\r\nPlease follow standard conventions and extract everything under a single directory.\r\n\r\nThis isn't the only questionable thing going on here. We've got broken symlinks also packaged (why not just create them automatically during installation?) and at a glance it looks like ~75% of the .dll files are executable, so there has bee no thought put into file permissions or presentation.\r\n\r\nThese should be very easy wins so I hope someone can look into this.",
