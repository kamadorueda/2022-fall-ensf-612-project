  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nInstalled version is `PowerShell-7.3.0-rc.1-win-x64.msi`.\r\n\r\nEnable the feature using PowerShell 7. You will notice it works:\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Windows> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All\r\nDo you want to restart the computer to complete this operation now?\r\n[Y] Yes  [N] No  [?] Help (default is \"Y\"):\r\n```\r\nNow try to disable it from same PowerShell, you will notice it does not work with either option:\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Windows> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All\r\nDisable-WindowsOptionalFeature: A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'All'.\r\nPS C:\\Windows> Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Offline -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V -All\r\nDisable-WindowsOptionalFeature: A parameter cannot be found that matches parameter name 'Offline'.\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\n`Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature` should undo all the changes made by `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature` or at least the `Offline` feature should instead.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe Microsoft official website does not explain or link on how to undo the change, apparently it's only one-way:\r\n[url=https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/]Hyper-V on Windows 10[/url]\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n$PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.7\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.7\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u0085}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "> That's the problem, that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n@superbonaci  - the module which contains these commands is owned by Windows, not by the PowerShell 7 language. \r\n\r\nI can't test on the machine I'm posting from,  but my memory ( from doing this a lot, but  quite some time ago) is that removing the parent feature removed all the children so there is no need for `-all` . If I'm mis-remembering and the child features _do_ need their own calls to `disable-`  then the inconsistency should be fixed, but it can't be fixed **here**  \r\n",
