  "body": "For PR https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/4262 validation was added to Windows and Linux. \r\nOn Linux, we change the default application to a shell command to verify the output.  On Mac, you would\r\nuse `lsregister` to do something similar, however, MacOS doesn't have a straightforward way to register\r\nand unregister at runtime (no api).  Registration is done as part of app creation and startup.",
