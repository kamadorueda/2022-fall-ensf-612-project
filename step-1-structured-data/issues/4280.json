  "body": "<sup>This is a follow-up to the discussion involving @daxian-dbw and @PetSerAl in #4257</sup>\r\n\r\nContext:\r\n\r\n* PSv5.1 introduced a generally helpful optimization that optimizes `@()` away in cases where an array is _directly_ constructed inside of it.\r\n   * I presume that the motivation for this optimization was the widespread, but redundant and inefficient practice of enclosing `,`-constructed arrays (\"array literals\") in `@()`, such as in `@(1, 2)`, where `1, 2` would not only suffice, but, in PSv5-, `@()` would actually (effectively) _clone_ the array.\r\n\r\n* **Unfortunately, this optimization is also applied when a _cast_ to an array type (e.g, `[int[]]`) is involved, which can have unpleasant side effects** - see below.  \r\n_Not_ optimizing in this scenario makes for conceptually clearer, predictable behavior.\r\n\r\n* While a change would technically be a breaking one, it is hard to imagine anyone having relied on the optimized behavior _with casts_ - a typical [Bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area) change.\r\n\r\n   * Also note that when the optimization was _introduced_ in PSv5.1, it was technically a breaking change too - though I suspect it wasn't announced as such or even at all.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n@([int[]] (1, 2)).GetType().Name\r\n\r\n$arr = 1, 2; @([int[]] $arr).GetType().Name\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nObject[]\r\nObject[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nInt32[]\r\nInt32[]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that versions up to and including v5 - before the optimization was introduced - behave as expected.\r\n\r\nWhy is the current behavior problematic?\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\n<sup>The examples in this section are courtesy of @PetSerAl.</sup>\r\n\r\nAll examples are undoubtedly edge cases, but the larger point is that this behavior should never have been introduced, and, given its \"stealth status\", this is an opportunity to get rid of it.\r\n\r\n* It subverts the fundamental assumption that `@()` always creates regular PowerShell arrays (`System.Object[]`):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> @([int[]] (1, 2))[-1] = 'foo'   # BREAKS, because the array is [int[]], not [object[]]\r\nCannot convert value \"foo\" to type \"System.Int32\".  ...\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n@PetSerAl points out that this fundamental assumption is even still reflected in other places in the source code: [`ArrayExpressionAst.StaticType`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master@%7B2017-07-18%7D/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/ast.cs#L9490) (a `@(...)` expression is of type `[System.Management.Automation.Language.ArrayExpressionAst]`).\r\n\r\n* It subverts the expectation that `@()` always _clones_ an array:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $a = [int[]] (1, 2); $b = @([int[]] $a); [object]::ReferenceEquals($a, $b)\r\nTrue    # $a and $b unexpectedly reference the same array.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the accidental reference equality only happens ~if the source type and the cast type are identical~ if the cast type is either the same as the source type or a type that the source type is (directly or indirectly) derived from (covariance).\r\n\r\nThus, if the _cast_ type is `[object[]]` and the source type is a reference type too, the problem always surfaces.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on macOS 10.12.5\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on Ubuntu 16.04.2 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.4 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.15063.413 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\n```\r\n",

In my understanding, this happens only in one of the following two conditions:\r\n\r\n- the expression is a `ConvertExpressionAst` or a ParenExpression that wraps a `ConvertExpressionAst`, and the convert-to type is an array.\r\n- the expression is an `ArrayLiteralAst` or a ParenExpression that wraps an `ArrayLiteralAst`.\r\n\r\nIn the first case, since the conversion is explicitly specified, it's very unlikely the resulting array will again be used as `object[]`. In the second case, the resulting array from `ArrayLiteralAst` is already `object[]` so it doesn't matter. Plus, altering this behavior would be a breaking change. Given the above, I prefer to not make a behavior change. But feel free to notify the PowerShell-Committee if you want a further discussion.",

It is inconsistent and should be fixed. But IMHO, the fix should be to change `ArrayExpressionAst.StaticType` to always return `System.Array` (also a breaking change :)). `StaticType` is by definition not accurate, because sometimes the actual type can be known only at runtime, for example, `BinaryExpressionAst.StaticType` returns `System.Object` when it's `-bor`, and the actual type may vary at runtime.",

Is this related to the same optimization, and, if so, how?\r\n\r\n@iSazonov:\r\n\r\nMy understanding is limited, but I hope it's accurate enough to say that in your example - due to the presence of array cast `[object[]]` - the (problematic part of the) PSv5.1+ optimization effectively behaves as if `@(...)` hadn't been specified at all; in other words: `@([object[]]$a)` and `[object[]]$a` behave identically in your scenario, and `$b = [object[]]$a` simply copies the array reference (in other words `$b` and `$a` reference the same array).\r\n\r\n  * By contrast, with a purely `,` constructed array (no cast), this behavior is not problematic, because `,` creates an `[object[]]` instance that by definition has no independent existence outside of `@(...)`, and skipping the enumeration-and-repackaging step that `@(...)` normally entails actually speeds up legacy code that mistakenly uses `@()` to initialize array literals.\r\n\r\nA `@(...)` expression is parsed as type `ArrayExpressionAst` and `ArrayExpressionAst.StaticType`  - which was never changed - still indicates `[object[]]`, even though the problematic optimization introduced `@(...)` expressions whose type could be different (e.g., `@([int[]] (1, 2)).GetType().Name` yields `Int32[]`).",

However, according to [PowerShell Language Specification Version 3.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36389), as quoted: \"_The result is the (possibly empty) unconstrained 1-dimensional array_\", `@(...)` should only return `object[]` array.\r\n\r\nThe PR #4296 addressed this, and Jason approved, so I assume the committee is fine with the change to make `@(...)` always return `object[]` array. If so, we can remove the `'Review Committee'` label.",

(Most PowerShell users probably don't even think about array-element typing and probably expect arrays to be able to hold any mix of data types)\r\n\r\n* that  `@()` always returns a _new_ array, without having to worry about reference equality (which is probably not even on the radar of most PowerShell users).\r\n\r\n> In other words, I think we could be open to changing what the language specification says to allow for better performance.\r\n\r\nPassing strongly typed arrays through strikes me as a rare use case that I don't think warrants optimization, given that it would contravene the expectations above.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, optimizing the _typical_ use case is well worth considering: passing the `[object[]]` output of a _single command_ through (optimizing the `@()` away if the enclosed single command happens to return a `[object[]]` array already).\r\n\r\nI can't speak to the technical feasibility, but here's an example where the `@()` could be optimized away (without contravening the assumptions above), which makes a noticeable difference with large output sets:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Could be optimized to: Write-Output (1..10000000)\r\n# Currently, the output is collected and a new array is constructed.\r\n@(Write-Output (1..10000000))\r\n```\r\n",

(I suppose in roundabout ways a command's output could hypothetically reference an array stored in a PS variable, but I don't think we need to worry about that).\r\n\r\nThe first optimization is really just a _courtesy_ to improve the performance in cases where users mistakenly apply `@()` to (unconstrained) array literals, even though it is pointless.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd one is by far the most common use case for `@()`, if I were to guess, and many scripts could benefit from it. Again, I can't speak to technical feasibility / effort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
