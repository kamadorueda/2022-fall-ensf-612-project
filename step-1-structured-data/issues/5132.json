  "body": "Hi guys!\r\nI have checked the PowerShell solution with the [CodeRush](https://www.devexpress.com/products/coderush/) Static Analyzer and fixed several code issues. Here's the summary:\r\n\r\n- The most common issue is [CRR0012: Logical OR expression has opposite operand](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CodeRushForRoslyn/118112/Static-Code-Analysis/Analyzers-Library/CRR0012-Logical-OR-expression-has-opposite-operands), such expressions can be simplified.\r\n- In [Words.cs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.PSReadLine/Words.cs#L112) our analyzers detect [CRR0025: This conditional's code block does not appear to be reachable](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CodeRushForRoslyn/118235/Static-Code-Analysis/Analyzers-Library/CRR0025-Unreachable-conditional-code-block-the-inversed-condition-is-already-satisfied), it's obviously false positive, but these searching `while` loops caught my attention. They look very similar to nested conditionals and I decided to fold them into for loops without bodies, they look clearer in this form.\r\n- Several places had [CRR0008: If-block matches else-block](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CodeRushForRoslyn/118106/Static-Code-Analysis/Analyzers-Library/CRR0008-If-block-matches-else-block), I saved the original conditionals in comments in case they need in future\r\n- I have found the **CRR0029: The ConfigureAwait(true) is called implicitly** issue. The simple delay does not require saving the synchronization context, plus it's better always add an explicit `ConfigureAwait()` call to `await`ed calls.\r\n- In [WSMan](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.WSMan.Management/ConfigProvider.cs#L2584) I found [CRR0017: Expression checks 'nodelist' for null after usage](https://documentation.devexpress.com/CodeRushForRoslyn/118132/Static-Code-Analysis/Analyzers-Library/CRR0017-Null-check-follows-usage) and one more small issue, maybe I should add another pull request for that repository.\r\n\r\nI hope this will help, here's the full report: [CodeIssuesReport.txt](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/1387705/CodeIssuesReport.txt). Thanks for being open source!\r\n",
