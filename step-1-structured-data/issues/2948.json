  "body": "How would one configure iTerm2 in order to go forward / back a word in PowerShell Core? Right now, if I try to use `ALT + B` and `ALT + F` keyboard shortcuts, the result is simply that a `b` or `f` character is printed. I even tried manually adding keyboard mappings to the PowerShell iTerm2 profile, but this didn't seem to have any effect positive or negative.\r\n\r\nBoth Bash and ZSH use the `ALT + B` and `ALT + F` keyboard shortcuts to go forward and back a word.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1128\" alt=\"screen shot 2017-01-03 at 8 28 30 am\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/466713/21612524/d12c4e52-d18e-11e6-9c40-b9f21c2c060c.png\">\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n**Trevor Sullivan**\r\nDocker Captain\r\nMicrosoft MVP: Cloud & Data Center Management\r\nhttps://trevorsullivan.net\r\nhttps://twitter.com/pcgeek86",
