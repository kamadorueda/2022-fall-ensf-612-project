  "body": "No mater we are doing an Invoke-GPUpdate  or gpupdate .\r\nIt shows me nothing except that \"updating policy\".\r\n\r\nHowever , company has tones of gpo objects. and DC is in a office that far away from the client.\r\nIt took a very very long time to update GPO. Sometimes I wonder whether the update process is dead or not.  nothing happen.\r\n\r\nIf Invoke-GPUpdate comes with a verbose-like parameter , which will show updating xxx gpo objects. completed xxx gpo object , updating xxxx gpo object , completed xxxx gpo objects ... ,then things will be much better.\r\n\r\nBR",
