  "body": "This cleans up the `libpsl-native` library and `CorePsPlatform.cs` file quite a bit. Most notably, the `HasFeature()` runtime queries have been removed and replaced with `#if LINUX ...` in the code (@lzybkr should like this).\n\nThis enables me to much more easily go through and revert unnecessary changes to PowerShell, which I intend to do next (though I have started some here, with `NativeItemExists` and `IsWinPEHost`; there is enough left that I wish to continue it separately).\n",
