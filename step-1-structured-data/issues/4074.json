  "body": "Fix issue #2909 \r\n\r\nI haven't included a test case with this fix because \r\n1. unicode issue is better to be judged by eye.\r\n2. this issue only repros in a non-english windows system with ps running under cmd window. Our current test environment won't touch this scenario.\r\n\r\nThus, one time manual verification might be enough.\r\n\r\nSummary of the issue:\r\n\r\nUnder non-english OS, if user start ps core under comandline and type \"help <cmdletName>\", the  output will be one character per line\r\n\r\nRoot cause of the issue:\r\nOnly Nano needs to use Unicode, but Windows and Linux need the default encoding. The way we judge if the current os is Nano server has been outdated.\r\nFix:\r\nUpdate the condition we use to judge nano server.",
