  "body": "Is this a bug in get-childitem?\r\n\r\nOn Mac OS 10.12.6, powershell core 6.0.2\r\n\r\nSteps to recreate:\r\n1. Mount network share using apple file protocol:\r\n(finder -> Go menu -> Connect to server -> afp://ipaddress/sharename\r\n2. open powershell for this location \r\n3. type $items = get-childitem -recurse\r\n4. Observe: each item is in the $items array twice.\r\n5. Observe $items.count is exactly 2x times the actual count of files.\r\n\r\nNote: adding a 3rd empty folder on the share and rerun the command, it returns the correct number of files.\r\n\r\n![screenshot of terminal](https://content.screencast.com/users/basementjack/folders/Snagit/media/90b172d6-612c-4beb-baaf-14c08e9fec16/2018-03-19_08-27-27.png)\r\n\r\nNote in the above screenshot, it should not be possible for the first result to be greater than the second result.\r\n\r\nCan anyone else recreate this behavior?\r\n\r\n",
