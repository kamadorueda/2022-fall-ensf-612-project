To do this, below packages  have installed on the centos 7.3\r\n1)powershell-6.1.0.preview.1-1.rhel.7.x86_64.rpm\r\n2)omi-1.4.2-1.x86_64\r\n3)gssntlmssp-0.7.0-1.el7.x86_64\r\n\r\npwsh  session hangs when i am running two sequential invoke-command. \r\n\r\ninvoke-command -computername IP-credential domain\\user-authentication Negotiate -scriptblock {$pwd}\r\n Give the password. and able to get pwd details.\r\nbut next if i run the same steps. powershell hang and waiting for nothing.\r\n\r\nI have tried this behavior from powershell-6.0.0_beta.6-1.el7.x86_64.rpm to till powershell-6.1.0.preview.1-1.rhel.7.x86_64.rpm.\r\n\r\nThis behavior introduced in powershell-6.0.0_rc-1.rhel.7.x86_64.rpm where is its working fine powershell-6.0.0_beta.9-1 build.\r\n<img width=\"883\" alt=\"2\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2241524/38125152-1fb267bc-3405-11e8-8279-c48b4b759932.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso I am facing second issue.\r\n\r\nTill beta 6.0.0_beta.9-1 build the responses were very fast from windows to linux and vice versa but after RC and till latest build of power shell, It taking much time to connect to the system.\r\nin terms of data, where Beta was taking 6-10 sec to connect to system, the latest build is taking 1-2 minutes to connect the system.\r\n\r\nfrom beta to RC. i am not seeing much about remoting commit apart from inclusion of psrp packages. \r\nP.S: Separate Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 from psrp.windows nuget package.\r\n\r\nCan anybody help me to understand more about the issue like why it got introduced in RC where as in beta its was working fine and taking less time.\r\n \r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n<img width=\"883\" alt=\"1\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2241524/38124584-7d1d804e-3400-11e8-8a6f-9bce6c478ba6.png\">\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nPowershell should not hang second time and should get current directory result.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\npowershell session should not hang for indefinite time.\r\n\r\nRoot cause: While doing the root cause analysis through wireshark, we observed that during first time,\r\nhandshaking is happening proper way[windows box is able to connect from linux]. but while doing second time connection, linux system is waiting for response.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-preview.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.1.0-preview.1\r\nOS                             Linux 3.10.0-693.21.1.el7.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Mar 7 19:03:37 UTC 2018\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n",

In wireshark logs (NTLMSSP_AUTH does not use Domain name), in PowerShell behavior is different for different version.\r\n\r\nPowerShell 6.0.0 Beta 6 - In any case username passed without domain name, so user is treated like local admin\r\nPowerShell 6.2.3 RC - PS provides as it is username, it does not remove domain user name** . In this case Negotiate Auth uses 1st Kerberos then NTLM which consume most of the time.\r\n",
