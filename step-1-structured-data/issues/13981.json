  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nDidn't find an existing issue... basically:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n@{ Name = 'hi'} | .\\Invoke-Test.ps1\r\n```\r\n\r\nfails, but\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n[pscustomobject]@{ Name = 'hi'} | .\\Invoke-Test.ps1\r\n```\r\n\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nWhere `Invoke-Test.ps1` has a parameter, `Name`, with `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName=$true`.\r\n\r\nFor newer users of PowerShell, it's hard to grasp what a `PSCustomObject` is and why it differs from a `Hashtable`. This is a scenario that confuses folks a lot.\r\n\r\nIf one could simply pass in a hashtable and have it work the same as a `pscustomobject` users would be less confused.",
