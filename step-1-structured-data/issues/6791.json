Yes,  using `Documents` for user-created content is the right choice, but it is only a  _convention_.\r\n\r\nThis asymmetry in how the `$HOME` folder is used between Unix-like platforms and Windows is unfortunate, but in this case I think it's more important to be consistent and stick with the well-defined, directly equivalent `$HOME` on all platforms.\r\n\r\nThat said, it would generally be handy for `Set-Location` to support the special / well-known folders supported by `[Environment]::` via  the `[Environment+SpecialFolder]` enumeration, so that you could do something like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-Location -SpecialFolder MyDocuments \r\n```\r\n\r\nSee #6966\r\n",
