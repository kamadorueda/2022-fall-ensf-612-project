      "body": "A .NET [char](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.char?view=netcore-3.1) is documented\r\n\r\n> Represents a character as a UTF-16 code unit.\r\n\r\nIf a unicode character cannot fit into a single UTF-16 code point then it must be represented by multiple chars when used in a string. Technically it can represent any value between 0 and 65535 (`[UInt16]::MaxValue`) but your character exceeds that size.\r\n\r\nFor example `\ud864\udffb` is part of the [CJK Unified Ideographs Extension B](https://unicode-table.com/en/blocks/cjk-unified-ideographs-extension-b/) set and the UTF-16 encoded byte value of that is `0x64 0xD8 0xFB 0xDF`. This is known as a surrogate pair in UTF-16.\r\n\r\nYou might consider using the new [Rune](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.rune?view=netcore-3.1) type that is designed to handle unicode values. Otherwise we would need to know more about what you are trying to achieve here to help you reach your goal.",

It will output 2 as String.Length just returns the number of chars it used for the string and it doesn't take into account things like surrogate pairs or other composite glyphs in Unicode.",
