  "body": "When reloading a module with classes, and the current session has data created by the older version of the module, we get error messages like\r\n\r\n```\r\nCannot convert the \"A\" value of type \"A\" to type \"A\".\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ $a = [A]::new()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSample code:\r\n```\r\nclass A {\r\n    [string] $a\r\n}\r\n\r\n[A] $a = [A]::new()\r\n\r\n# paste this later\r\n\r\nclass A {\r\n    [string] $a\r\n}\r\n\r\n$a = [A]::new()\r\n```\r\n\r\nI suggest that we add a check if the names of the classes are the same, when generating the error message, and in that case add some explanation why it is happening.",
