  "body": "Fixes #2037 and #2205 \nI addressed the issue by delaying user settings directory creation until a write operation takes place. At that point, the console should be up and running, so it is safe to let errors propagate for eventual display to the user. This should address all startup scenarios regardless of hosting technique.\n\nI also wrote some new tests to validate basic file operations on the user settings PowerShellProperties.json file.\n",
