  "body": "The Makefile is being automatically generated, but makegen silently drops two source files because they  exist  in the $ objdir  and don't actually exist on the system. Those files are currently stubbed in monad linux, but should also come from Windows.  The files aren't going to come from Windows. We'll have to make stub targets.  This is pretty low priority. Will come after integration with PSW team.  This should happen  automagically  with the switch to DNVM, that is, since the build system itself will change, it'll become trivial to build this as it should be built from the stubs.
