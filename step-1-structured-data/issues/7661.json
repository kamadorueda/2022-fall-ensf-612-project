Unless there is a good reason, not to, at which time we will adjust the tests, if needed.\r\nDuring development, we expect the latest revision to a package to be used.  Comments in the code indicate to disable one of the tests until we have a better mechanism for this.\r\n\r\nThat is two questions combined into one:\r\n\r\n1. Does this make the build fail if a new version is released?\r\n    * Yes\r\n\r\n1. Is the failure irreproducible?\r\n    * Under certain circumstances the failure would not be reproducible, but that is true for many tests.\r\n      It would not be reproducible if the package owner removed the new package, but the tests logs what the new version was.  \r\n      So, this failure would be diagnosable.\r\n\r\nThe maintainers are happy to fix this issue, if the issue arises in your PR.\r\n",
