  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI have a Rest API Call that is supposed to upload a file.\r\nI keep getting this error\r\nThe cmdlet cannot run because the -ContentType parameter is not a valid Content-Type header. Specify a valid Content-Type for -ContentType, then retry.\r\n\r\nMy header looks like this\r\n`{\r\n  \"Content-Disposition\": \"attachment; filename=Shadow Copy Restore.docx\",\r\n  \"Authorization\": \"Bearer ....\",\r\n  \"Content-Length\": \"FILE_SIZE\",\r\n  \"Content-Type\": \"application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\"\r\n}`\r\n\r\nI've tried the content-disposition with and without quotes around the file name.\r\n\r\nI've created the body of the request with:\r\n`$body = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($path)`\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the -InFile parameter does not seen to work with this API.\r\nI have also tried a content type of application/octet-stream and get the same results.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nNo error\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nThe cmdlet cannot run because the -ContentType parameter is not a valid Content-Type header. Specify a valid Content-Type for -ContentType, then retry.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nThe cmdlet cannot run because the -ContentType parameter is not a valid Content-Type header. Specify a valid Content-Type for -ContentType, then retry.\r\nTo suppress header validation, supply the -SkipHeaderValidation parameter.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\name                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.5\r\nOS                             Linux 5.18.13-100.fc35.x86_64 #1 SMP PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Fri Jul 22 14:20:24 UTC 2022\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

After using Postman and looking at Postman's Powershell Code example I found the solution.\r\n\r\nManually build the headers as a hash table:\r\n\r\nContent-Type                   application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document\r\nAuthorization                  Bearer VcjJj....\r\nContent-Disposition            attachment; filename=\"CWilliams.docx\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRead the file in as a byte array:\r\n`$body = [System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes($path)`\r\n\r\nIssue the following Command:\r\n`$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Method 'POST' -Uri $Uri -Headers $Headers -Body $body`\r\n\r\nThis works.\r\nI was trying this before but adding 'Content-Length ' to the Headers. If you add that it fails with odd errors.\r\n\r\nWhat ever headers -InFile is producing doesn't work properly with the Smartsheet API.",
