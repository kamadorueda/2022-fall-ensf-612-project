  "body": "Before August, we should decide what APIs within the `System.Management.Automation.Platform` class ([`CorePsPlatform.cs`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/CoreCLR/CorePsPlatform.cs)) to expose publiclly, as the class itself needs to become public to unblock #1174. This will involve a refactor and clean-up of the class and the platform changes originally made during the port to Linux / OS X, which is intrinsically part of our diff review process.\n\nProposed public APIs:\n- IsLinux\n- IsOSX\n- IsWindows\n- IsCore\n- GetLocation(enum DataType) (a refactor of the XDG BDS selector)\n",

However, we have two approaches:\n- IfUnix ( XDGSelector(type) ) else ( WindowsPath )\n- SelectFolder(type) and make this internally figure out Unix / Windows paths (this requires more work)\n\nEither way, it probably makes sense to have a class for location logic.\n",
