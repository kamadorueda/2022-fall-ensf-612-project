      "body": "The AD cmdlets will do this regardless of $PSDefaultParameterValues, with specifying these properties manually, so it's not really related to that.\r\n\r\nThe AD cmdlets have a 'defaut property set' of a handful of properties that it returns when no properties are specifically requested. When you request specific properties, it treats those as \"additional\" to the default set, _not_ as a full replacement for its default set.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have objects with only certain properties on them, you need to use Select-Object to pare off the properties you don't want.",
