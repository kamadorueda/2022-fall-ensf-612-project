      "body": "@TravisEz13 I plan to move all of the HTTPS tests to WebListener (#4719).  \r\n\r\nFor HTTP (no-S) tests that are currently pointed to httpbin I plan to pick the one (possibly /get), create the same functionality in WebListener, and move all the tests that use it to WebListener. Before I begin, though, I'd like to just confirm that this is the right path to take. I figured I would start moving one httpbin target URL at a time and then work on moving the HttpListener tests one URL at a time. The end goal being that all HTTP/HTTPS tests will run against WebListener and HttpListener can be retired.",
