  "body": "<sup>Follow-up from #6714</sup>\r\n\r\nCurrently, `Set-Content` writes to whatever existing files match a wildcard pattern passed to its (implied) `-Path` parameter.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the following will overwrite _all_ existing `*.txt` files in the current directory:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n'hi' | Set-Content *.txt # !! Overwrites ALL *.txt files\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior is risky and should be changed to match the more sensible behavior of other output-to-file cmdlets such as `Out-File` (and therefore the `>` / `>>` operators), which generate an _error_ if the wildcard expression resolves to more than 1 file.\r\n\r\nIt is worth examining _all_ output-to-file cmdlets on this occasion.\r\n\r\nTechnically, this is a breaking change, but presumably one that falls into [Bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area).\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on macOS 10.13.4\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1709, OS Build: 16299.371)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.16299.251 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; Version 1709, OS Build: 16299.371)\r\n```\r\n",

Is this the case?\r\n\r\nYes, if you pass an _array_ of _literal_ file paths to `-Path` / `-LiteralPath`, which to me unambiguously signals the intent.\r\n\r\n_No change need there_, because these parameters are already typed `[string[]]`.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, the _wildcard_-based way of targeting multiple file is the fraught behavior, which I think should be eliminated.\r\n\r\nI used the `'hi' | Set-Content (Get-Item *.txt)` example to demonstrate that someone who truly wants to target multiple files will still be able to do so, even once the wildcard-based method is taken away.\r\n\r\nNow you could ask what should happen if an _array_ is passed to `-Path` (possibly implicitly) and at least one _element_ of that array is a wildcard expression?\r\n\r\nFor simplicity, my vote is for disallowing _any_ wildcard expression that matches more than 1 file, whether stand-alone or as part of an array.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, the desired behavior is:\r\n\r\n* You can pass one or more _literal_ paths to `-LiteralPath`.\r\n\r\n* You can pass one or more  literal paths or wildcard patterns - in any combination - to `-Path`, as long as no single wildcard pattern matches more than 1 file.\r\n",

      "body": "@PowerShell/powershell-committee looked at this and we compared it to behavior in `zsh` and `bash`.  It seems that `zsh` does support redirection to multiple files matching the wildcard while `bash` complains that the destination is ambiguous.  Also given that there seems to be legitimate cases where you want to initialize multiple files to the same content, then we think this is not a bucket 3 breaking change.  Also, if `-WhatIf` is used with `Set-Content` it does inform you of what was matched and would be written.  As noted, `Out-File` restricts to matching a single file so we have a bit of inconsistency between `Out-File` and `Set-Content`, but those two cmdlets don't have to be identical otherwise they'd be a single cmdlet.  We believe this is `By Design`",

And question is should we switch the default to LiteralPath in all scenarios (if we get path from pipeline we already bind to LiteralPath by PSPath).",
