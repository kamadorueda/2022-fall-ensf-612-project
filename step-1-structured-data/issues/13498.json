  "body": "## Integrate cleanmgr.exe with PowerShell\r\n\r\nIt would benefit Configuration Manager administrators greatly if there were PowerShell cmdlets for implementing cleanmgr.exe. This would greatly benefit us greatly by being able to remotely clean systems up for deployments using the PowerShell WinRM. \r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI envision being able to use a cmdlet possibly labeled Invoke-DiskCleanup that would have parameters to meet the same selection as is shown when running cleanmgr.exe. The list would be\r\n* Drive\r\n* Computer\r\n* lowdisk\r\n* verylowdisk\r\n* sageset\r\n* sagerun\r\n* Downloaded Program Files\r\n* Temporary Internet Files\r\n* Offline webpages\r\n* Windows error reports and feedback\r\n* DirectX Shader Cache\r\n* Delivery Optimization Files\r\n* Downloads\r\n* Recycle Bin\r\n* Temporary Files\r\n* Thumbnails\r\n* Remove Previous Windows Versions\r\n\r\nExample: Invoke-DiskCleanup -drive c: -Downloads -RecycleBin -Thumbnails -Computer TestSystem",
