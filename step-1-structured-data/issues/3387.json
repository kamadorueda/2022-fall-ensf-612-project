  "body": "#3051 introduced the `if((-not ($skipTest)) -and $IsWindows)` block in `test/powershell/engine/Help/HelpSystem.OnlineHelp.Tests.ps1` because our default-browser-discovery code, which was used in `Get-Help -Online`, didn't work correctly on the Azure code-coverage VM.\r\n\r\nAfter #3281, that code was replaced by calling into `ShellExecuteEx`. We need to verify if `Get-Help -Online` works fine now on the Azure code-coverage VM, and if it does then this `if` block should be removed completely.",
