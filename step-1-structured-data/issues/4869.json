I'm not sure what the test was originally meant to accomplish but there is not an equivalent `Invoke-WebRequest` test and there are already other tests for `Invoke-RestMethod` which test `text/html` responses.  httpbin.org/encoding/utf8 did not return `text/plain` anyway. *shrugs\r\n\r\nreference #2504",
