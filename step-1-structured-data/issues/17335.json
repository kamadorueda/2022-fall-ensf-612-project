(I'm thinking about C# modules)\r\n\r\nI'm considering adding an IServiceProvider property to Runspace/SessionState (and InitialSessionState) to help with getting hold of an IServiceProvider in a way that is accessible from cmdlets, and also easy to inject when writing tests.\r\n\r\nIs this something that has already been considered?\r\n\r\nWorth a PR?\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

We agree that there is value in providing a uniform way to use dependency injection in PowerShell, but we would need an alternate proposal that solves the conflict issue described in [#17349 (comment)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/17349#discussion_r874075860). We would need a way to ensure that a module author could obtain an `IServiceProvider` that is unique to their module (or group of modules).\r\n\r\nFor now we recommend utilizing the pattern suggested in [#17349 (comment)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/17349#discussion_r873888306).",

Considering how much trouble related issues have been, I don't think it's a good idea to add more on that pile. Especially since the use of DI is not blocked, I gave an example of a working pattern one can use today.\r\n\r\n> Perhaps the DJ already supports this?

I'm unsure what their answer would be other than recommending a different service provider per author, but you're welcome to start a discussion there.",
