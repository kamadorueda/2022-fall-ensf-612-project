I couldn't find with && or old connect case # 778798\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTo improve more Linux-friendlyness, I do like to propose `&&` syntax, again. (as many others used to do since powershell is released)\r\n\r\nIn CMD or Bash, there are `&&` which means \"execute command 1, and if it succeeds, execute command 2\".\r\n\r\nWhen I move cmd/bash command `build && run_tests` to PowerShell, I need to change code to run with following choices.\r\n\r\n1.  `(build) -and (run_tests)`\r\n1. `build; if ($?) {run_tests}`\r\n1. `cmd /c \"build && run_tests\" or `bash -c \"build && run_tests\"` (don't forget quote command with \"\", it means can not straight copy&pate.)\r\n\r\n`-and` is powershellish way but not familiar to fresh users, and it will output Error Message and `boolean output`. try ` (ls z:\\) -and (echo hoge)`.\r\n\r\nI think offer `build && run_tests` syntax is great experience for many users.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nNew operator `&&`.\r\n\r\nCurrently it produce error.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS> echo fuga && echo hoge\r\nAt line:1 char:11\r\n+ echo fuga && echo hoge\r\n+           ~~\r\nThe token '&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version.\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : InvalidEndOfLine\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Ref\r\n\r\n> https://connect.microsoft.com/PowerShell/feedback/details/778798/implement-the-and-operators-that-bash-has\r\n>\r\n> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/563600/can-i-get-to-work-in-powershell",
