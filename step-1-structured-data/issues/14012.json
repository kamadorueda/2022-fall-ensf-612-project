  "body": "According to https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13880#discussion_r519262499 code in `src/System.Management.Automation/engine/ComInterop/` comes from dotnet/runtime and should be frozen.\r\n\r\nBut in #13967 (part of #13880) we made changes to fix [IDE0044: Add readonly modifier](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/fundamentals/code-analysis/style-rules/ide0044).\r\n\r\nSo this PR reverts these changes and disables code analyzers in this directory.\r\n\r\n",
