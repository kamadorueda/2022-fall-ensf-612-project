  "body": "When PowerShell is installed as a .NET global tool, it prepends its own `$PSHOME` folder to `$env:PATH`.\r\n\r\nHowever, on macOS `$PSHOME` contains an _incompatible_ `pwsh` binary that is for _Linux_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, from within an existing session, invoking `pwsh` (by mere file _name_) unexpectedly fails.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Install PowerShell as a .NET global tool, to ~/.dotnet/tools\r\ndotnet tool install powershell -g\r\n\r\n# Invoke it, and try to re-invoke its own CLI.\r\n~/.dotnet/tools/pwsh -noprofile -c 'pwsh -noprofile -c write-output hi' | Should -Be 'hi'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, due to incompatible binary being invoked:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected 'hi', but got @('ResourceUnavailable: Program 'pwsh' failed to run: Exec format errorAt line:1 char:1' ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core v7.0.0 (7.0.0) on macOS 10.15.3\r\n```\r\n",

Knowing about [#11141](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/11141) explains why changing $PATH didn't fix the problem for me. The workaround I mentioned in my bug is very simple:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd $PSHOME\r\nmv pwsh pwsh.elf\r\nln -s ../../../../../../../../../../../.dotnet/tools/pwsh pwsh\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt fixes this bug as well, unsurprisingly. I've been running in this state since I posted my bug and have yet to notice any adverse effects.",
