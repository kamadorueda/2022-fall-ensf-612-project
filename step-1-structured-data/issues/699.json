  "body": "This enables building PowerShell through VS Code. The build task launches the installed version of PowerShell and runs `Start-PSBuild`. This enables a `launch` debug task to immediately debug the `powershell` process, without having to attach to an external process.\n\nNote that it launches the built version of PowerShell as `powershell -c 'exit'`. This should be modified to suit a user's needs.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/699)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",

Perhaps they should be moved to `docs/debugging/vscode` along with a more full readme on how to use them. Just putting this up for now; I'd like to reorganize all the documentation with @vors, following a pattern similar to [corefx](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/Documentation).\n",
