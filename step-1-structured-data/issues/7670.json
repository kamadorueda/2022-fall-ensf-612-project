  "body": "This issue is being open in regard to the placement of the cursor when using the up arrow to cycle through previously executed commands in 6.1-rc. In 5.1 and 6.0.4, it works correctly; however, in 6.1-rc it does not.\r\n\r\nAfter any command, when pressing the up arrow, the cursor is placed at the beginning of the command/line. The expectation is that the cursor will be at the end. Instead of being able to add to the previous command, on its far right end, I'm having to first move to the far right end, and then begin typing. It's not major, but it is a different experience from 5.1 and 6.0.4.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> Get-ChildItem\r\n> # Up arrow, cursor is under the G in Get-ChildItem.\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected that the cursor will be at the end of the previous command(s).\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nCursor is placed at the beginning of the previous command(s).\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-rc.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.0-rc.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
