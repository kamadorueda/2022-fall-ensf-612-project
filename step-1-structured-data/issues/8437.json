  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nLinuxMint is the most Windows 10 like distro.\r\nI have hacked this script to get it to seem like Debian - but it identifies as linuxmint 19 - which does not map to a proper /etc/apt/sources.list.d/microsoft.list.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI am willing to do this work, but need someone to help validate whether this is a simple mapping problem of mapping LinuxMint to an existing Ubuntu or Debian version, or if there are deeper things like specific packages needed.\r\n\r\nA related issue is #6364 - however, I am only concerned with the scope of LinuxMint 19 as a first iteration use case of that issue.",
