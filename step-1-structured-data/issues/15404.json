I'd like my scripts to generate the same file data regardless of the size of the console they happen to be invoked in.\r\n\r\nIn Linux/bash, you can only query the window dimensions thru a tty handle, and when you redirect an operation to a file handle, that query fails, so all console/window processing (even pagers) get disabled...  But with powershell, it seems file redirection still leaves the underlying operation inherently knowing (and using!) the console handle (that is not even involved in the write!).\r\n\r\nThanks for any explanation!\r\n\r\nPS You can see the same behavior with write-information \"...\" 6>file, but not with write-output \"...\" >file -- I am not sure why...\r\n",

There are lots of cases where this happens and it seems fundamentally wrong -- shouldn't the console width *only* be used for output actually going to the console, not output redirected to files?\r\n\r\nIn my case the issue is more complicated than adding an out-string -width -- I'm using information stream file redirection to allow a script to both have console output the user can see (which I'm fine being clipped) as well as writing *all unclipped data* to a log file...  But my log file ends up with line breaks every time a line is wider than the console width, which of course, makes the log file impossible to grep/parse.\r\n\r\nThis seems like a trivially simple example that should always work:\r\n\r\nps >ps.txt\r\n\r\nBut it doesn't?

      "body": "Write-Output doesn't demand a specific format, it's designed to handle any kind of object. Submitting a string to it and then writing it to a file is the exact same operation (albeit effectively doing a little bit of work twice) as just saving that string directly to the file. In other words, these two statements are equivalent:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\"*\"*200 > file.txt\r\nWrite-Output (\"*\"*200) > file.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo formatting really happens here because you only have a simple string, there's no complex object to format.\r\n\r\nHowever, non-output streams are strongly typed -- they enforce a specific object type which all other output sent to them must be converted to. For `Write-Warning`, this is `WarningRecord`, much as for `Write-Error` it's `ErrorRecord`, and similar for all the others. \r\n\r\nWhen saving this to a file, they're not simple strings or values, and get run through the formatter to determine the appropriate string representation. So, much like other examples that have been mentioned, the exact representation can depend on the console size at the time.\r\n\r\nWhether that's the \"correct\" model or not is a bit of a debate topic, I suppose, but it's how it has been designed up to this point. This has been the case since sometime around PSv3 when most of the alternate streams were introduced (Information stream was a bit later, being introduced in PS 5.1).",

How did you find this?\r\n\r\nBasically it can be used to set _any_ cmdlet/function's default parameter values for the session. The syntax is `$PSDefaultParameterValues['Cmdlet-Name:ParameterName'] = $value` -- and note that you can use wildcards for cmdlet or parameter names, so for example you could enable -Force by default for all *Item commands (get-item, get-childitem, etc) with: `$PSDefaultParameterValues['*-*Item:Force'] = $true`\r\n\r\nThat it works for `>` is basically an implementation detail because `>` is calling the `Out-File` cmdlet implicitly.",
