  "body": "This is a regression from Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nOn Windows, AppX packages (for in-box applications such as Calculator) are installed in subfolders of hidden folder `$env:ProgramFiles\\WindowsApps`\r\n\r\nPowerShell Core cannot locate these folders, not even with `-Force` (which shouldn't be necessary, because it is only the parent folder that is hidden).\r\n\r\nCuriously, you _can_ target _files inside_ those folders, though only by _literal_ name.\r\n\r\nThe problem may be related to permissions.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun the following on Windows:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$pkgDir = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsCalculator).InstallLocation\r\n\r\n# OK, because a file *inside* the dir. is targeted by literal name.\r\n{ Get-Item -EA Stop -Force $pkgDir\\Calculator.exe } | Should -Not -Throw\r\n\r\n# Targeting the dir. directly fails:\r\n{ Get-Item -EA Stop -Force -LiteralPath $pkgDir } | Should -Not -Throw\r\n{ Get-ChildItem -EA Stop -Force -LiteralPath $pkgDir } | Should -Not -Throw\r\n\r\n# Using a wildcard produces no output.\r\n# (This problem, unlike the others, also occurs in Windows PowerShell).\r\nGet-ChildItem -Force -Path $pkgDir*  | Should -Not -BeNullOrEmpty\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests but the first fail, because the directory itself cannot be targeted:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\"Cannot find path 'C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps\\Microsoft.WindowsCalculator_10.1908.0.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe' because it does not exist.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe wildcard-based command produces no output.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.5\r\n```\r\n",
