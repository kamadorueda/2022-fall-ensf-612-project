  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a trusted community module maintainer, I would like a wealth of information shouted from the rooftops about how to prevent PowerShell scripts from being reported as a trojan by Windows Defender. Recently, a file that has not changed in 2 years was reported as a Trojan to two of our users.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8278033/118113836-14a35d80-b3e7-11eb-85ff-5cfecc670245.png)\r\n\r\nWhile our file is not a trojan, false positives from Windows Defender impact the trustworthiness of our module. We've worked hard over the years to engender trust in both dbatools and PowerShell. Currently, I hold up our CI/CD process to review each commit to ensure it is not malicious before I publish it to the PowerShell Gallery.\r\n\r\nIs there a solution for whitelisting trusted community modules and adding a feature to PSScriptAnalyzer that highlights problematic techniques?\r\n\r\nSo far, one user has confirmed that the signed version from the PowerShell Gallery is not triggering AV. The problem with this is that:\r\n\r\n1. Not all PowerShell Developers can afford Code Signing Certificates\r\n2. Not everyone uses the PowerShell Gallery and we'd like to continue offering installs via GitHub. Our code cannot be signed and saved to the repository.\r\n\r\nIt seems that this may be a result of some enhancements to [AMSI and machine learning](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2020/08/27/stopping-active-directory-attacks-and-other-post-exploitation-behavior-with-amsi-and-machine-learning/)\r\n\r\n> Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) helps security software to detect such malicious scripts by exposing script content and behavior. AMSI integrates with scripting engines on Windows 10 as well as Office 365 VBA to provide insights into the execution of PowerShell, WMI, VBScript, JavaScript, and Office VBA macros. \r\n\r\n(I hope IronPython is impacted as well \ud83d\ude05)\r\n\r\nHere's information about the Defender definition that alerted the user\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8278033/118118685-8bdbf000-b3ed-11eb-94f2-d73681a7f79d.png)\r\n\r\nI assume that `[Reflection.Assembly]::LoadFrom($assemblyPath)`, which we use to make imports as fast as possible, is the problematic technique, but I can't find any confirmation. Other blogs talk about using that for loading from memory but we are loading from disk. Once we get this issue solved, however, I'd like to know what to modify in other files. Perhaps the Gallery can detect these techniques and email module owners.\r\n\r\nOther PowerShell users are experiencing this a well as noted in the following links:\r\n\r\nhttps://twitter.com/JustinWGrote/status/1392518022900850688\r\nhttps://twitter.com/psCookieMonster/status/1392796401545981953\r\nhttps://twitter.com/DrAzureAD/status/1361298815815417856\r\nhttps://twitter.com/PrzemyslawKlys/status/1392933835978027019\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/vscode-powershell/issues/3017\r\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/jj4wzw/removing_trojanpowershellmountsiaml_trigger_from/\r\nhttps://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-defender-for-endpoint/defender-detected-powershell-ise-exe-as-trojan-powershell/m-p/2180534\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, [this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20210421190712/https://getimageview.net/2020/06/02/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-is-hurting-independent-developers/) suggests that the file being unsigned is the problem, and a commenter said that \"Cleared it up by submitting it to Microsoft\u2019s service at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission.\" Do we make it part of our GitHub pipeline to submit changed files to that site?\r\n\r\nEdit: I know that the PowerShell team is not the Defender team,  but considering unsigned PowerShell files in a git repository (it's impossible to sign and commit, I've tried, it changes the SHA) trigger AV warnings, this may be a very big problem for PowerShell development and scripting in general. Taking a look at [Warren](https://twitter.com/psCookieMonster/status/1392796401545981953)'s code, which has been flagged by Defender, nothing stands out.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Pester wasn't mocking git... \r\n# Borrowed idea from https://github.com/pester/Pester/issues/415\r\nfunction Invoke-ExternalCommand {\r\n    [cmdletbinding()]\r\n    param($Command, [string[]]$Arguments, [switch]$Passthru)\r\n\r\n    Write-Verbose \"Running $Command with arguments $($Arguments -join \"; \")\"\r\n    $result = $null\r\n    $result = & $command @arguments  \r\n    Write-Verbose \"$($result | Out-String)\"\r\n    if($Passthru)\r\n    {\r\n        $Result\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n````",

      "body": "First, apologies to @SteveL-MSFT if my last comment was a little salty. I realize this isn't Powershell's problem directly. For some additional info, the script in question hasn't been touched in 2 years, and after reviewing it looking for anything we were doing that might have triggered AMSI(like direct .Net calls or inline C# type of things), it's as vanilla Powershell as you can probably get. That said, the irony of it all is that this is the script we use to make sure certain file extensions and directories are in Defender's exclusion lists. We are temporarily disabling certain Defender behaviors like real-time network scanning.\n\nI can see why heuristics may have interpreted that behavior as potentially malicious, but if you can't manage Defender policies with the Defender Powershell module then what's the alternative? Again, for our environment, these endpoints are not in a domain and have no network access except for what we specifically allow, so solutions like Group Policy are not an option.\n\nIt would be preferable if Defender had options to customize actions to take for different events. In this case, warn us, but don't quarantine immediately. Understandably, from a security perspective, that increases the potential risk for us, especially if a specific event is actually legitimately malicious. I'd argue though that that is something that we, as an organization, should have processes and solutions in place to handle such an event. \n\nIn our case, due to the segregated nature of our network environment, potential impact is rather low. We can simply replace the affected endpoint(s) without any worry of the compromise being able to spread to other systems, so for us, such a risk may be acceptable. It wouldn't for everyone though, so this is a tricky problem to solve.\n\nStill, I think the problem is that Defender's heuristics are a wee bit _too sensitive_ and need dialed back a bit.",
