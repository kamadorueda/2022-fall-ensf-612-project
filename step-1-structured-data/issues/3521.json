That creates a chicken and egg problem and we just using the previous pre-built for the `download.sh`.\r\n\r\nI propose to remove the tag version pinning from the [install instruction](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/installation/linux.md) to avoid confussion. It safe to get the version from main and it would allow maintainers update one less place, when making the release.",

I talked to @daxian-dbw  during the release and pointed out this issue i.r.t. the docker files.  I think we should fix the process for the next release.   Once download.sh is changed, Linux won't build until we publish the next build.  We need to put some thought into how to make the work properly.  I suggest using the repositories where available in download.sh. ",
