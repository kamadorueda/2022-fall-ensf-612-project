  "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThere are millions of PowerShell command logs under temp directory. Their naming is:\r\n\r\nremoteIpMoProxy_ScheduledTasks_1.0.0.0_localhost_GUID\r\n\r\nThis week, our server became unresponsive time to time and today it's completely dead. because of these log files. We tried to remove them but filesystem does not give any response. Temp directroy makes >10 MB IO per second.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/928600/87777441-c4d92180-c829-11ea-8dfd-55bfefd84e92.png)\r\n\r\nI don't know why and how these logs are generated but we use PowerShell 7.0. We will update to latest version after we resolve this incident. There is a scheduled task for every 5 minutes to check some ScheduledTask status, and here is the command of it:\r\n\r\n```$GetSystemRoot = $env:SystemRoot;\r\n$DefaultPSModulePath = $GetSystemRoot + '\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules\\';\r\n$GetPSModulePath = $env:PSModulePath;\r\n$PSModulePathCheck = '0';\r\n$PSModulePathStrings = $GetPSModulePath.Split(';');\r\nforeach ($PSModulePathString in $PSModulePathStrings) {\r\nif ($PSModulePathString -eq $DefaultPSModulePath) { $PSModulePathCheck = '1'; }\r\n}\r\nif ($PSModulePathCheck -ne '1')\t{\r\n$env:PSModulePath = $env:PSModulePath + ';' + $DefaultPSModulePath;\r\n}\r\nImport-Module ScheduledTasks;\r\n$result = 'false';\r\ntry\r\n{\r\nif ((Get-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'VirtualMetric Trigger').State -ne 'Running')\r\n{\r\n    $result = 'false';\r\n\r\n    Start-ScheduledTask -TaskName 'VirtualMetric Trigger'\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n    $result = 'true';\r\n}\r\n}\r\ncatch\r\n{\r\n$result = 'false';\r\n}\r\n$result;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't know how to produce this. Is this a result of some kind of logging?\r\n\r\nI also see this part under master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/RemoteDiscoveryHelper.cs: \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/RemoteDiscoveryHelper.cs#L1046\r\n\r\nWe just want to know why this would happen and why there is no purging system for this. Do we have to check our temp files and remove these powershell logs?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nYusuf",
