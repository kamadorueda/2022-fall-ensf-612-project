Then give pwsh execute permission.\r\n3 I made a script for batch operations, you can refer to:\r\nhttps://gitee.com/chuanjiao10/kasini3000/blob/master/zkj_install_powershell_offline_win2linux_keyfile.ps1\r\n\r\nit is copy powershell files from \"master\" to \"node\".\r\n\r\nFinally, it should be noted that:\r\nAt present, there are only packages for x86, arm cpu architecture, and other types of linux, which need to be compiled by themselves.",
