  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWe now have the very convenient ability to navigate backward and forward in an automatically maintained list of the up to 20 most recent locations (directories) via `Set-Location` / `cd`, using the  `-` and `+` `-Path` arguments.\r\n\r\nA nice complement to this functionality would be to (a) _list_ the recently visited locations and (b) allow _selecting_ one to revisit _interactively_, say with a `-SelectFromHistory` / `sel` switch:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING\r\n# -SelectFromHistory / -sel presents an interactive menu of the recently visited\r\n# locations to select from, in order to navigate back there.\r\nPS> cd -sel\r\n(1) C:\\Users\\jdoe\r\n(2) C:\\Users\\jdoe\\Projects\r\n(3) C:\\Windows\r\n...\r\nEnter the index of the location to navigate to: \r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: In non-interactive sessions, using this parameter must fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
