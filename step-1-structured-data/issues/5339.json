Therefore it does not change the build itself, hence no need for testing.\r\nIn your appveyor.yml file [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/appveyor.yml#L3), the [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-environment/#visual-studio-2017) image is specified, which already has `WiX Toolset 3.11.0.1701`",
