In another, previously unmentioned case, I was spawning `powershell` in Node, where it also wrapped at 80 characters. By default, the Node console wraps at 80 characters, so this kinda makes sense. However, when spawning other executables, the output did not wrap at 80 characters.",

Please only specify the exact Powershell version, your system's name and version, environment (shell and so on), and your test actions. The more precisely you describe the situation, the easier it will be to implement the fix.",
