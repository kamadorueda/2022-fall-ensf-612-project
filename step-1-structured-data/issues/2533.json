It's hard to track down that this code affects IntelliSense and nothing else.\nI also noticed that completion for `[pscu` in `Emacs` PSReadLine mode (default on Unix) is completely screwed.\nIt turn into `[PS` instead of anything meanfull.\nIt could be a PSReadLine issue (not the fitst time I see problems with Emacs mode).\n",
