At first I thought the issue was in the API, but the issue does not occur in Powershell 5.1, or when using postman. Powershell 7 does not allow to send credentials for basic authentication in plaintext when the api is running on localhost without https, without -AllowUnencryptedAuthentication, but when I add it, this issue occurs. The issue does not occur when I disable the authentication requirement on the API. The API simply denies the request as unauthenticated 401.\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ninvoke-webrequest `\r\n  -uri http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict `\r\n  -method post `\r\n  -Credential $Cred \r\n  -body '{\"test\":\"stuff\"}' \r\n  -AllowUnencryptedAuthentication `\r\n  -ContentType application/json\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nSuccessful request.\r\n```\r\nStatusCode        : 200\r\nStatusDescription : OK\r\nContent           : {\"HI\": [{\"Running\": true}]}\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nInvoke-WebRequest: The response ended prematurely.\r\n$error[1].exception\r\n\r\nTargetSite     : Void MoveNext()\r\nStackTrace     :    at System.Net.Http.HttpConnection.SendAsyncCore(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n                    at System.Net.Http.AuthenticationHelper.SendWithNtAuthAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Uri authUri, ICredentials credentials, Boolean\r\n                 isProxyAuth, HttpConnection connection, HttpConnectionPool connectionPool, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n                    at System.Net.Http.HttpConnectionPool.SendWithNtConnectionAuthAsync(HttpConnection connection, HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean\r\n                 doRequestAuth, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n                    at System.Net.Http.HttpConnectionPool.SendWithRetryAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean doRequestAuth, CancellationToken\r\n                 cancellationToken)\r\n                    at System.Net.Http.AuthenticationHelper.SendWithAuthAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, Uri authUri, ICredentials credentials, Boolean\r\n                 preAuthenticate, Boolean isProxyAuth, Boolean doRequestAuth, HttpConnectionPool pool, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n                    at System.Net.Http.RedirectHandler.SendAsync(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\n                    at System.Net.Http.HttpClient.FinishSendAsyncUnbuffered(Task`1 sendTask, HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationTokenSource cts, Boolean\r\n                 disposeCts)\r\n                    at Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestPSCmdlet.GetResponse(HttpClient client, HttpRequestMessage request, Boolean keepAuthorization)\r\n                    at Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.WebRequestPSCmdlet.ProcessRecord()\r\nMessage        : An error occurred while sending the request.\r\nData           : {}\r\nInnerException : System.IO.IOException: The response ended prematurely.\r\n                    at System.Net.Http.HttpConnection.SendAsyncCore(HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\r\nHelpLink       :\r\nSource         : System.Net.Http\r\nHResult        : -2146232800\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
