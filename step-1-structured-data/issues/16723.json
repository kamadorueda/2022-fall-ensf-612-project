      "body": "There are multiple annoyances here. \r\n\r\n1.  It seems the ANSI names are (e.g). Red and Bright Red, and that is the convention used in the settings for VS Code and Windows Terminal (the two main places I use PowerShell)  Back when someone decided what the names should be for `ConsoleColor` they picked Dark Red and Red , so PSStyle is \"right\" and what we have done up to now is \"wrong\". Making people who are familiar  with the ANSI  naming switch to the names in ConsoleColor is bad, making people familiar with ConsoleColor go the other way isn't good. \r\n2. We often want to specify a color parameter and help the user to complete it by giving the parameter an Enum type; if there were a new enum for names in `PSStyle` it we might not want to depend on it.  We can define our own enum or we can just use `ConsoleColor` (as used by `$host` and `Write-Host`) . We can't remove all doubt about whether  \"Red\" means the Lighter or Darker \r\n3.  The old style console host, Windows terminal, and VS Code all define what their idea of Red / light / dark red are.  Windows PowerShell redefined the console colours for dark yellow to ~ white and dark magenta to \"PowerShell blue\", so       \r\n`$e = [char]27; \"$e[35m Hello $e[0m\"`  will be visible in Windows Terminal but lost if I run PowerShell.exe, that's extreme but   \r\n`$e = [char]27; \"$e[33m Hello $e[0m\"` renders significantly differently in different places - in VSCode the default RGB values for the 16 colours make bright variants almost identical to the non-bright ones. \r\n\r\nI think the best solution might be to add Script methods (or Script Properties) to `ConsoleColor`  making it easier to go from a parameter declared `[ConsoleColor]$foreground`  to a string with the ANSI codes added. Since these would be added by loading a type.ps1xml file, they can be added in any version making dependencies less of a problem.  But not knowing what formatting as yellow will look like when someone else runs a script is a problem that will be with us for a while. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
