      "body": "Have noticed this as well; it broke some of our CI scripts that call out to all sorts of executables. Have also experienced slightly different behaviors between windows and Linux depending on the target application (for example ef migration bundles) and sometimes different if I splat arguments. \r\n\r\nSo far only when invoking applications and not with commandlets \r\n\r\nI intend on opening issues in a few repos that offer argument completer scripts (Flux, helm, kustomize) as their powershell variants are all broken since 7.3 (with a simple fix)... Will link here once I do. \r\n\r\nI checked release notes and didn't see mention of this behavior. ",
