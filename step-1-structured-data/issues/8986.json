  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently, you can only obtain multiple values with `-Count` if you supply an _input collection_ to select random elements from.\r\n\r\nHowever, **sometimes you want to generate multiple random values from a given _range_,** such as \"generate 3 random values in the range 0 to 1\":\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# WISHFUL THINKING - currently, you have to call Get-Random in a *loop*.\r\nPS> Get-Random -Maximum 1.0 -Count 3\r\n0.00964209344687038\r\n0.399765062797705\r\n0.589964029188251\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nAllow combining parameter `-Count` with (implied) `-Minimum` and /or `-Maximum` as well, in which case `-Count` simply specifies how many values in the range to generate.\r\n\r\n",
