      "body": "Some thoughts...\r\n1) Looks like [minikube](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube) is currently using Windows PowerShell. Somebody should advise minikube folks to switch to PowerShell Core / releases of this repo. Windows PowerShell (unlike this repo / PS Core) is basically in maintenance mode at this point and only taking high-impact security fixes.\r\n2) As continuation from the previous point - this issue, being a problem with Windows PowerShell, does Not belong to this repo.\r\n3) As an idea: try comparing `$Env:PSModulePath` on machines where scenario works and where it doesn't.
