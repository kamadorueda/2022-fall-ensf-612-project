  "body": "We are trying to deploy elastic search 2.3.2 package using HPSA tool in windows server 2012. The installation script is written using powershell. When I am trying to manually install the package using the scripts, it is working flawlessly. But when I am trying to deploy the package using HPSA tool, the logs are showing that the deployment is executed.But the installation bat file in the package is not getting executed and it is failing to install elastic search in machine. I tired changing different execution policy in machine, but it is not resolving the issue. Please help me out , since many days of testing is getting delayed due to this\r\n",
