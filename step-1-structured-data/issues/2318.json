  "body": "<!--\n\nIf it is a bug report:\n- make sure you are able to repro it on the latest released version. \nYou can install the latest version from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases\n- Search the existing issues.\n- Refer to the [FAQ](../docs/FAQ.md).\n- Refer to the [known issues](../docs/KNOWNISSUES.md).\n- Fill out the following repro template\n\nIf it's not a bug, please remove the template and elaborate the issue in your own words.\n-->\n## Steps to reproduce\n- Teach someone about PowerShell and its built-in remote capabilities\n- Show them the magic of Get-Service <someservice> -ComputerName A,B,C\n- They ask you if you can pipe the results to Stop- or Start-Service to run on multiple machines\n- Experience the joy of telling your children there is no Santa again, when you tell them that Stop-Service and Stop-Process don't have `-ComputerName` support.\n- Their eyes glaze over when you explain that you _can_ do it in WMI instead.\n## Expected behavior\n\n`Stop-Process` should have `-ComputerName` support.  It stinks today to have to use an ugly `Get-WMIobject` cmdlet instead to actually enact changes on remote processes or services.\n## Actual behavior\n\nIf you try to Pipe the results of `Get-Process` or`Get-Service` to its matching Start or Stop cmdlet, PowerShell tries to make changes ON YOUR LOCAL PC instead. \n## Environment data\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\n> $PSVersionTable\n\nName                           Value                                                                                   \n----                           -----                                                                                   \nPSVersion                      5.0.10514.6                                                                             \nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                     \nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                                                                 \nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.33440                                                                         \nBuildVersion                   10.0.10514.6                                                                            \nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                 \nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                     \n\n\n\n```\n",
