      "body": "JSON is a string representation of object data. The string representation may contain the literal `null`, but the data itself is still a string until the data is converted back _from_ JSON format.\r\n\r\nIf you check the contents of `$body` you'll see that it contains the word `\"null\"` -- this is a non-null string containing those letters. When converting back from JSON it will indeed resolve to a proper null value, but a valid JSON object must _always_ be string in JSON format, and will not be null in any context except after being converted back into object format.\r\n\r\nEDIT: For clarity, the fact that it has previously returned a true `null` or empty string value rather than the JSON equivalent is, effectively, a bug that has been fixed since. \ud83d\ude42 ",

I am sure it's easy to fix if it's just a small code-base. but the only issue that I see is that a lot of existing scripts that work in PS 5 and PS 6 will not work in PS 7 without changing the code.  It's a big breaking change.\r\n\r\nAny word from the Product team?  CC- @SteveL-MSFT \r\n",
