  "body": "# Overview\n\nPowerShell Core for Windows should support a common launcher that can start either a specified version of or a \"default\" version .\n# Changes Required\n1. An executable or script that supports a -version <version> parameter and passes cmd line arguments to an instance of PowerShell.exe\n2. The executable or script resides is %ProgramFiles%\\PowerShell\\powershell.exe\n3. It determines the \"default\" instance of PowerShell by reading a value from a configuration file in its same directory. File type and format are flexible and should be driven by the ease of parsing the info.\n# Open Issues\n1. The exact design has not yet been finalized. This is a place holder issue to note that work is likely required to support the desired behavior.\n2. On non-Windows systems, the installer already creates a symlink on the path that points to the latest installed instance of PowerShell. No additional work is likely required in those environments.\n",
