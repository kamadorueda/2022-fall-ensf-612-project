  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user, when I inspect the overloads of a given .NET method, I want to know which parameters are _optional_, so I only pass arguments to them if actually needed.\r\n\r\nAccessing a method without invoking it (via `(...)`) conveniently shows all its overloads (signatures), but currently doesn't indicate which parameters are _optional_:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nAdd-Type -NameSpace demo -Name Foo -MemberDefinition 'public static void Bar(string param, int optParam = -1) { }'\r\n# Show the method signature.\r\n[demo.Foo]::Bar\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Current_ output - NO indication that `optParam` is optional):\r\n\r\n```\r\nOverloadDefinitions\r\n-------------------\r\nstatic void Bar(string param, int optParam)\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Desired_ output - clear indication that `optParam` is optional, ideally also with its default value, if technically feasible:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOverloadDefinitions\r\n-------------------\r\nstatic void Bar(string param, int optParam = -1)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote: The **same representation should be used for `Get-Member`** output, as originally proposed in #7373.\r\nI suspect that the implementation is shared anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
