  "body": "# Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2018-8256: Microsoft PowerShell Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\r\n\r\n## Executive Summary\r\n\r\nA remote code execution vulnerability exists when PowerShell improperly handles specially crafted files. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could execute malicious code on a vulnerable system.\r\n\r\nTo exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send a specially crafted file to a vulnerable system.\r\n\r\nThe security update fixes the vulnerability by ensuring PowerShell properly handles files.\r\n\r\nSystem administrators are advised to update PowerShell Core to version `6.0.5` or `6.1.1`.\r\n\r\n## Affected Software\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability affects PowerShell Core prior to the following versions:\r\n\r\n| PowerShell Core Version | Fixed in          |\r\n|-------------------------|-------------------|\r\n| 6.0                     | 6.0.5             |\r\n| 6.1                     | 6.1.1             |\r\n| 6.2                     | https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/8252       |\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability also affects `Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive` if it was installed from the PowerShell Gallery.  The issue was fixed in version `1.2.2`.\r\n## Advisory FAQ\r\n\r\n### How do I know if I am affected?\r\n\r\n#### PowerShell Core\r\n\r\nIf all of the following are true:\r\n\r\n1. Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in [Affected Software](#affected-software) to see if your version of PowerShell Core is affected.\r\n1. If you are running a version of PowerShell Core where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.\r\n\r\n#### Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive installed from the PowerShell Gallery\r\n\r\n1. Run `Get-InstalledModule  -name Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive` from PowerShell.  If the module version is less than `1.2.2.0`, then you are affected.\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\n#### PowerShell Core\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Installing PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n#### Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive installed from the PowerShell Gallery\r\n\r\nRun `Update-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive`\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Commit IDs\r\n\r\n[3f85c94b](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/3f85c94bd2eb8511454418739c50542a1cb5d3e2)\r\n[da5d8e70](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/da5d8e707df55f9d252b96f800d6be94a991a10c)\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\r\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\r\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\r\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\r\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\r\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\r\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n[Snyk Security Research Team](https://snyk.io/)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\r\n\r\nSee [acknowledgments](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/acknowledgments) for more information.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-8256](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8256)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (November 13, 2018): Advisory published.\r\nV1.1 (November 14, 2018): Fix typo in how to tell if `Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive' in affected when installed from the PowerShell Gallery.\r\n\r\n*Version 1.1*\r\n*Last Updated 2018-11-14*\r\n",

When checked it shows indeed an older version. How can I in that case easily update the module without modifying permissions/ownership under C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0 ?",

The issue you mention should be fixed by a windows patch in the same [CVE](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8256).  For Windows PowerShell support, I suggest contacting Windows support.\r\nThis repo is for tracking PowerShell Core issues. \r\n\r\ncc @anmenaga @SteveL-MSFT \t",

      "body": "@KurtDeGreeff just an idea... if you want to use a patched version of the Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive module and don't care if an old (bugged) version sits on the system (or if you have permissions to delete it - just do it)...\r\njust install the patched module from the PS Gallery:\r\n`Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive`\r\nIt will be installed to `<Program Files>\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules`\r\n\r\nNow when you load the module by name `Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Archive` it will load and use fixed version (with higher module version number) even though you might have the old/bugged one sitting on the system.\r\n",
