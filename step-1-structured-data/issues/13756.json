  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nNote: I posted this issue in the [Azure Powershell Repo](https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell/issues/13136) and was redirected to this Repository for AzureAD issues.\r\n\r\nWhen running `Get-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment` in `AzureAD` version `2.0.2.116` it behaves exactly like running `Get-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignedTo` on `AzureAD` version `2.0.2.106`, while `Get-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignedTo` on `v2.0.2.116` behaved exactly like `Get-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment` on `v2.0.2.106`.\r\n\r\nI assume that in the latest update the command got swapped somehow.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, run \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignment -ObjectId <object-id>\r\nGet-AzureADServiceAppRoleAssignedTo -ObjectId <object-id>\r\n```\r\n\r\nand notice the different output between the two `AzureAD` versions\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.19041.546\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.19041.546\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\ntagging @danigian",
