      "body": "Not going to lie, this issue is why I downloaded the code.  I'm looking at a filesystem filter driver that needs to make use of alternate data streams, and I need to ensure I have tools to look at them to find and ferret out bugs.\r\n\r\nThat said, since it's well-known that Powershell doesn't allow administrators to even see alternate data streams on directories, they provide a very good place for a red team to store data for exfiltration.  The fact that Powershell doesn't support alternate stream syntax on directories is arguably a bug in Powershell.  (As has been noted, NTFS itself supports alternate data streams on directories, and has supported them since Windows NT 3.1.)\r\n\r\nThis is an incredibly easy patch.  (System.Management.Automation\\namespaces\\FileSystemProvider.cs, Microsoft.Powershell.Commands.FileSystemProvider.GetItem(string path). Just get rid of the isContainer check.)  It took me about 3 hours to find where to fix it, and about 2 minutes to understand how to fix it.\r\n\r\nI have built a local pwsh that doesn't have the isContainer check, and I have tested that it works with Get-Item.  However, a potential issue is raised due to the nature of NTFS alternate data streams on files versus directories:\r\n\r\n1. A file always has at least one stream of type $DATA, which is unnamed.  This means that `Get-Item filen.ame -Stream *` will always return at least one entry on files stored on NTFS.\r\n2. A directory usually has zero streams of type $DATA.  This means that `Get-Item dirn.ame -Stream *` will usually return nothing, which leads (interactively) to Get-Item returning a red message of `Get-Item: Reached the end of the file.`.\r\n\r\nPut simply, \"a directory is a file which can have zero data streams.\"  I haven't tested the behavior of powershell-as-distributed on FAT32 or exFAT, where neither files nor directories contain alternate data streams, but I suspect that the `Reached the end of the file.` message would be returned in all cases on those filesystems (either that or an exception would be thrown).\r\n\r\nSo, I have a question: should this functionality be enabled by an additional flag to the Get-Item command (like \"-EnableDirectoryStreams\" or such)?  Or should the isContainer check simply be removed, since containers in the NTFS filesystem can have streams and should be able to be seen regardless?\r\n",

Does the behavior parity concern apply to a glob application across multiple searches? (If you do a `Get-Item *.txt -Stream specificstream` it essentially repeats the search on every *.txt file, whereas the original glob of *.txt runs a single search against the current directory. Should a single file that is matched from the original glob but which doesn't contain specificstream prevent the search for specificstream from continuing across every requested file?)\r\n\r\nI will say that my own use case would be better served by it being a nonterminating exception, and I think that it makes more sense for a search failure on one file to not terminate the search against all other files.  That said, I'm not even a contributor here yet, and what I think doesn't really have as much weight as yours.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think that any change to the behavior for multiple files will necessitate committee review.

      "body": "So, if we catch an ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER Win32Exception (which usually indicates that the filesystem doesn't support streams), would that be a case to throw a terminating error rather than a non-terminating error?  Or is it reasonable to continue on the hypothesis that we may be running on a filesystem that may support streams for some objects but not all?  (NTFS is not the only filesystem which supports filestream syntax, and there's no enforcement within the kernel that NTFS's stream semantics are implemented or adhered to by the filesystem.)\r\n\r\nPut another way, how tightly do we want to couple the Win32 PowerShell with NTFS?",
