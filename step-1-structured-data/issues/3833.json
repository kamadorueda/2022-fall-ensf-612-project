On Debian-like Linux distros such as Ubuntu it is file `/etc/default/locale`  that stores the default locale, but _system-wide_. I'm unclear on how it works in other Linux distros. However, _user-level_ defaults on Linux would generally require modifying user-level initialization files, which are _shell-specific_.\r\n",
