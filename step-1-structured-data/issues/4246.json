  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n1. Connect to remote Powershell session on a different computer using new-PsSession.\r\n2. Run some cmdlets in the above session (using PowerShell implicit remoting)\r\n3. Now Restart the remote PS service\r\n4. Now try running new cmdlet, it throws a windows popup for credentials.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nGiven in our scenario, the credentials are oAuth tokens, they cant be entered by the user. Instead we need a handle/callback that our can provide the UI and ultimately return the credentials.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nGiven user doesn't know what to do with the popup for creds, users is forced to close the session and start afresh.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n",
