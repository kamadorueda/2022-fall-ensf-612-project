  "body": "Json is very convenient to glue tools together.\r\nFor example, both python and powershell have ability to serialize and de-serialize anything into json without a schema.\r\nUnfortunately, after de-serialization from json in PowerShell, you get immutable objects.\r\nIf you just get mutable hashtables, life would be much better: i.e. you can create some object in python, toss it to powershell, enhance with some info and inspect the complete result.\r\n\r\nOne of the date points about a similar request: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3740128/pscustomobject-to-hashtable\r\n\r\nIt's a more generic question, but I think that in context of json it's especially desirable.",

With PSObject instead of hashtable it ever requires some step like https://stackoverflow.com/a/34383413/1355726 or doing some `Get-Memeber` with NoteProperty, which is pretty obscure way to do it.",
