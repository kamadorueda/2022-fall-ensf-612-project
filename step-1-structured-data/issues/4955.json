In `psrp.windows-beta.2` package, the `win-x86` folder in the package actually contains the x64 plugin, which caused WinRM to fail to load the plugin on x86 systems.\r\n\r\nThis has been fixed in `psrp.windows-beta.3` package. @mirichmo has verified that remoting works on `Win7-x86 + WMF 5.1` and `WinBlue-x86 (no WMF)` with the x86 plugin from `psrp.windows-beta.3` package.",
