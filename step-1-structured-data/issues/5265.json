  "body": "fixes #5257 \r\n\r\nAdds support for the following response Header scenario:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nLink: <https://MYDEVORG.okta.com/api/v1/users?limit=200&filter=status+eq+%22STAGED%22>; rel=\"self\"\r\nLink: <https://MYDEVORG.okta.com/api/v1/users?after=OKTAID&limit=200&filter=status+eq+%22STAGED%22>; rel=\"next\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nCoreFX treats multiple header responses as separate array elements. Unless each array element is parsed, only the first one would be accepted. The current implimentation not only returns an incomplete `RelationLink` dictionary, but also breaks `-FollowRelLink` when a sever responds with multiple  Link headers. This PR corrects both the pagination and dictionary.\r\n\r\nThe test can currently only be done on Windows as we currently lack a native server that supports returning multiple headers with the same name (see #4639). The test would only result in a false pass on Linux and macOS.",
