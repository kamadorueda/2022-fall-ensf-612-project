It did not work previously, so I don't know whether you did something with the MSIX package in latest release or if something changed in Intune.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I tried uninstalling it on a client today, the package got removed from the computer, but Intune reports error:\r\n\r\n* Unknown error (0x87D103E8)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6450056/75671151-621e2980-5c7e-11ea-9dc0-2d0e52fcb398.png)\r\n\r\nI will try on myself and see if I can get some logs or other information.",
