I remember very early on just thinking \"oh it's a PowerShell object, it makes objects do PowerShell things\".  I know that's just anecdotal but I don't think most ps users would think about it much ~~last~~ past that. Though I could understand it being confusing for C# folks maybe.\r\n\r\n>Are there still cases where they get stripped?\r\n\r\nThe one that comes to mind is method parameters where the object will not be rehydrated the same (such as when `StoreTypeNameAndInstanceMembersLocally` is true).  I believe there are more, but none other readily remember-able.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nclass Test {\r\n    static [object] GetMembers([object] $obj) {\r\n        return Get-Member -InputObject $obj\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n[Test]::GetMembers($profile) | ? MemberType -eq  NoteProperty\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that example only certain types and pso instances will be stripped of ETS properties because in most cases they will be rehydrated correctly.  That said, if the method is binary it will not. That's why `PSSerializer.Serialize` *always* strips ETS.\r\n\r\nThe reason for that (and the reason it can't be fixed) is because most dotnet API's have no awareness of `psobject`.  They won't know that they need to (or if they don't need to) unwrap it.  They also don't typically know how to enumerate the properties since just using straight up reflection won't yield much useful.\r\n\r\nIs it super likely that you'll ever run into one of these scenarios? Nah, but if it does it'll be real hard for most to troubleshoot and I personally don't think there's a downside.",

Such objects are created under the following conditions:\r\n\r\n      * _Invariably_, for technical reasons (the CLR's string interning), when attaching ETS instance members to `[string]` instances (actually, it seems that the resurrection tables _are_ also used in this case, only with the `[psobject]` wrapper rather than the `[string]` instance as the lookup key, but the net effect is the same: the ETS instance members are attached to the _wrapper_).\r\n\r\n         * It is generally not advisable to create such wrapped `[string]` instances, because the ETS properties are hard to discover, given that the `[psobject]` wrapper still prints like a string by default; it is unfortunate that the automatic `$PROFILE` variable uses this technique; similarly, the strings output by `Get-Content` are wrapped this way, currently without an opt-out - see #7537. Such wrapped strings can conversely surface their ETS instance members in unexpected situations - see #5797.\r\n        \r\n         * For the same reasons it is not advisable to add instance ETS members to instance of .NET primitive types (such as most number types, `[char]`, and  `[bool]`) (even though they _are_ passed through to methods); additionally, the engine _caches_ certain numbers so `$v = 42; $v | Add-Member foo bar` doesn't just make `$v.foo` return `'bar'`, but also associates the property with the _literal_:  \r\n`& { param($p) $p.foo } 42` then prints `'bar'`.\r\n\r\n      * _Potentially_, by _engine-internal_ code that _opts-into_ the v2 behavior; the - sensible - default in v3+ is to leave `StoreTypeNameAndInstanceMembersLocally`  at `false`, i.e. to associate the ETS instance members with the the wrapped object themselves. (Note that _user code_ cannot opt-into v2 behavior, because the [static method that creates a `PSObject` with `StoreTypeNameAndInstanceMembersLocally` set to `true` is `internal`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/2c8955eaebfa147e6973e24ef8495afc6d6ef104/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/MshObject.cs#L1050).) See below.\r\n\r\nNote that for a method in _compiled code_ the _only_ way to receive an object with ETS members - whether instance or type-level, whether with `StoreTypeNameAndInstanceMembersLocally` set to `true` or not - is to declare the parameter as `PSObject`. \r\n\r\nBy contrast, a _cmdlet's_ parameters - which are implemented as .NET type _properties_ - _do_ receive `PSObject` wrappers as such even for `object`-typed parameters = properties (not just for `PSObject`-typed ones).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Instances of wrapper-only instance members  in the engine code as of PowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.1** (`StoreTypeNameAndInstanceMembersLocally` set to `true`):\r\n\r\nNote: Obtained via regex `PSObject.AsPSObject([^)]+?,.+?)`, with false positives weeded out.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/022c14917f266818ca5d1e9c08955d85a0b70a87/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Get-Error.cs#L79\r\n\r\n> Or lets say you're just trying to add a property or type name for formatting, now everywhere that instance is used is changed\r\n\r\nThe above use avoids that, and constitutes  the aforementioned [edge case](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/11122#issuecomment-555736430); it is a legitimate use that should have no impact on user code and is unlikely to raise questions, given that the context is _for-display_ formatting.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/022c14917f266818ca5d1e9c08955d85a0b70a87/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Select-Object.cs#L536\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/022c14917f266818ca5d1e9c08955d85a0b70a87/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Select-Object.cs#L553\r\n\r\nThis is the _bug_ reported in #7937.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n> I do kinda wish it was used more though. Resurrection is really annoying with types that are cached for instance. For example, making a provider that outputs Type objects, now every literal has PSPath attached to it.\r\n\r\nI think we can cross that bridge when we get to it. Instance members showing up on cached instances is already a problem with cached number literals, as shown above, but adding ETS instance members to instances of such types is ill-advised anyway.\r\n\r\nOverall, I think it is important _not_ to use per-wrapper instance members anymore, so as to spare users the confusion of members disappearing in ways that are hard to reason about and may seem inexplicable altogether to the casual user.\r\n\r\nIt's technically different, but the behavior described in #4347 sows similar confusion.\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Use `[System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]` - there is no need for `[psobject]` wrappers around the elements.\r\n\r\n* In PowerShell code, the wrappers will mostly not be noticeable (though can cause side effects, as shown in #5579), but they're unnecessary.\r\n\r\n* In compiled code, if you pass something like `[System.Collections.Generic.List[psobject]] @(1, 2)` to a `System.Collections.Generic.List<object>`-typed method parameter, that code will see the list elements as `[psobject]`, not `[int]`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLet me try to summarize at a higher level (my personal assessment):\r\n\r\n* From the perspective of code _written in  PowerShell_, `[psobject]` should never have entered the picture: it should always have been an _invisible helper type, used only behind the scenes_ (Compiled (C#) code for cmdlets, by contrast, _does_ need to be aware of `PSObject` and use it on occasion, but by no means always - see #5551). To put it differently: The presence of `[psobject]` in Powershell code amounts to a _leaky abstraction_.\r\n\r\n* There are unfortunate historic reasons that promoted the visibility and use of `PSObject`:\r\n\r\n  * The unfortunate technical conflation of `[pscustomobject]` and `[psobject]`: they _both_ point to `System.Management.Automation.PSObject` - even though there is a distinct `System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject` type (see #4344). Only the latter should be visible to PowerShell code. The conflation causes a number of problems, such as #4343 and #11921\r\n\r\n  * Early PowerShell code - before the availability of syntactic sugar `[pscustomobject] @{ ... }`, which notably does _not_ work in the form `[psobject] @{ ... }` - often used `New-Object PSObject`, even though `New-Object PSCustomObject` would have been the conceptually appropriate form from the beginning.\r\n\r\n  * Syntax diagrams for cmdlets with \"untyped\" parameters show `<PSObject>` (which is technically correct, but from a PowerShell user's perspective `<Object>` would make more sense - it would be a beneficial \"lie\", just like `([psobject] 42) -is [int]` being `$true` is).\r\n\r\n  * (Note that hidden members such as `.psobject` are obviously useful for advanced tasks, but, given that they're automatically available on any value directly, they don't require dealing with `[psobject]` as a whole.)\r\n\r\nWhile `[psobject]` cannot _technically_ be banished anymore from PowerShell code due to backward compatibility concerns:\r\n\r\n* we can fix the aforementioned bugs resulting from the conflation of `[pscustomobject]` and `[psobject]`, as well as the bugs that cause different behavior in the presence of incidental `[psobject]` wrappers.\r\n\r\n* we can _document_ that direct use of `[psobject]` is virtually never necessary (see below), thereby discouraging its use.\r\n\r\nEliminating `[psobject]` from PowerShell code simplifies the \"object ontology\" for PowerShell users: Objects fall into only one of two categories:\r\n\r\n* instances of .NET types that PowerShell optionally decorates with additional members, the implementation of which you needn't know or care about.\r\n\r\n* dynamically constructed ad hoc objects (\"property  bags\") in the form of `[pscustomobject]` / `System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject` instances.\r\n\r\nThat both these features are ultimately implemented via `[psobject]` is purely an implementation detail.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nTo recap the _only_  scenario in which you currently truly _need_ `[psobject]` in PowerShell code:\r\n\r\n* If you define a _method_ in a _PowerShell class_ that accepts what is conceptually a `[string]` parameter _and_ that parameter needs access to a given string's ETS _instance_ members (which would apply if you pass `$PROFILE` and need access to the `AllUsersAllHosts` property, for instance, or if you pass a `Get-Content`-output string and need access to the `.ReadCount` property, for instance), you must define that parameter as `[psobject]`.\r\n\r\n  * This conceptually obscure requirement solely exists due to a _technical limitation_ that is outside PowerShell's control.\r\n\r\n* As stated, `[psobject]`-wrapped instances of _other_ types work fine (except, potentially, due to the _bug_ described in  #7937), and in _functions_ / _scripts_ / _script blocks_ even `[string]` works fine, so there is _never_ a need to type a parameter `[psobject]` there.\r\n",
