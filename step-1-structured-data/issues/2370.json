  "body": "In 5.1, to import the classes defined in a module, you using the 'Using module' keywords. But the Using keyword does not take a ModuleSpecification object, so you can't enter a version. This is a real problem if you have multiple versions of a module. Also, module versioning lets you version the classes in a module, but Using requiring a constant prevents it.\n\nI'd like to suggest the following:\n-- Make Import-Module import classes. It already has version params + FullyQualifiedName.\n-- Add ClassesToExport key to the module manifest. If that breaks back-compat, put it in PrivateData.\n-- Add Class parameter to Export-ModuleMember.\n-- Make classes public by default, but users can use Export-ModuleMember or manifest to prevent export of a class.\n\nIf this isn't possible, at least add ModuleSpecification value to 'Using module.'\n",
