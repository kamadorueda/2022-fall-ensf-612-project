  "body": "Fix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3267\r\n\r\nThe change enables checking for the charset meta attribute when the Content-Type header does not define the charset. When found, the text content is re-encoded to the target charset.\r\n\r\nA new property has been added to BasicHtmlWebResponseObject and HtmlWebResponseObject to support verifying the encoding. Attempting to do so from the returned content is non-deterministic.\r\nSee https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/pull/1543 for example usage.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Three tests are pending the resolution for issue https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2867",
