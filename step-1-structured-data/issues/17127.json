  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nProblem with .NET forms DPI scaling, not scaling in blurry mode/legacy scaling in 7.2.2\r\nCauses position of controls to skew in unexpected manner. \r\n\r\nIn this case, I use a dialog designer that has the same exact problem as the visual studio form designer, so knowing the screen scale is not enough. Also, I do not know a viable method to get the screen scale for other forms other than below, which this problem renders useless.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$vscreen = [System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::VirtualScreen.height\r\n\r\n[xml]$xml = @\"\r\n            <Window\r\n                    xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation\"\r\n                    xmlns:x=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml\">\r\n            </Window>\r\n\"@\r\n$dum = (New-Object System.Xml.XmlNodeReader $xml)\r\n$win = [Windows.Markup.XamlReader]::Load($dum)\r\n\r\n$screen = [System.Windows.Forms.SystemInformation]::VirtualScreen.height\r\n\r\n$global:ctscale = ($screen/$vscreen)\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nForms should scale in legacy compatibility, at scale value of 1.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nForms scale at current scale of monitor, similar to WPF, but with control positions skewed.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nI uninstalled this update, needed immediate correction. Can replicate appearance programatically. Before I realized this was update related, I performed a system restore (did not resolve). Had to uninstall Powershell and reinstall to get my system to behave.\n```\n\n\n### OS Data\n\n```powershell\nVersion    Caption\r\n-------    -------\r\n10.0.19043 Microsoft Windows 10 Home\n```\n\n\n### Windows update log\n\n```markdown\nAttached\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n[WindowsUpdate.log](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/files/8455799/WindowsUpdate.log)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3017980/162546489-00d3f783-3c3a-48f3-b828-f6f6c2e317db.png)\r\n### Bad Behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3017980/162546701-6ca1ebe0-c030-4c49-89f7-aa7714865808.png)\r\n### Good behavior\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3017980/162546816-b9075b4c-6cd6-42b1-bb9f-aba8c8044f31.png)\r\n",
