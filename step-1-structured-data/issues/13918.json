  "body": "Copied from https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2499 which was originally from @aydeisen - originally filed at https://github.com/dotnet/docs/issues/5314\r\n\r\nThe documentation cited comes from /// comments in the source code. So the change needs to be made in here.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.cmdlet.shouldprocess?view=powershellsdk-1.1.0\r\n\r\nNormally, the API documentation is straightforward about the different overloads in a method, and whether they augment more minimalist overloads, or are used to cover different purposes\r\n\r\nFor the life of me, I can't figure out when I would use [ShouldProcess(String, String, String, ShouldProcessReason)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.cmdlet.shouldprocess?view=powershellsdk-1.1.0#System_Management_Automation_Cmdlet_ShouldProcess_System_String_System_String_System_String_System_Management_Automation_ShouldProcessReason__) or [ShouldProcess(String, String, String)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.cmdlet.shouldprocess?view=powershellsdk-1.1.0#System_Management_Automation_Cmdlet_ShouldProcess_System_String_System_String_System_String_) or why, instead of the other two.  The examples not being in formatted code blocks isn't really helping either.\r\n\r\nBoth of those methods say `This variant allows the caller to specify the complete text describing the operation, rather than just the name and action.`  I assume the 'caption' parameter is supposed to allow a more freeform text over the canned text when only providing the 'target' or both 'target' and 'action'.  But why would I use 'caption' when it says `may be displayed by some hosts, but not all`, and the overloads with only 'action'/'target' parameters don't document such a limitation?\r\n\r\nAdditionally, as this document is related to PowerShell, I don't understand why 'ShouldProcessReason' would ever be needed.  ShouldProcess would only be used if `CmdletBinding()` is called with `SupportsShouldProcess=$True`, which then [exposes the -WhatIf parameter](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_functions_cmdletbindingattribute?view=powershell-6#supportsshouldprocess).  What use case is there to then specify 'ShouldProcessReason'?\r\n",
