A `-bnot` on bigint would be rather inherently unpredictable due to its arbitrary size.",

      "body": "I can't find a source for this specific instance but typically the reason you see instructions defined for 32 bit integers but not smaller is due to processors being much better optimized to handle them.  So behind the scenes C# would probably have to promote the `byte` to 32bits anyway, this way it's obvious that that's being done.\r\n\r\nThe bigger problem is that there's no real way to do an unchecked explicit conversion between `int` and `byte` in PowerShell the same way you can in C#.  PowerShell uses the `IConvertible` interface methods, C# uses the `conv.u1` CIL instruction.  The latter more or less reinterprets the same bits as said type, instead of trying to convert/validate it.  So `(byte)(~(byte)0xff)` returns `0` where `[byte](-bnot ([byte]0xff))` throws because the *value* `-256` isn't valid for a `byte`.",
