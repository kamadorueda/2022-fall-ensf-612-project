  "body": "Hi\r\nWhen I open PowerShell I get a message that there's a new version of PowerShell available to install and gives me a link to this GitHub page.\r\n```\r\n  A new PowerShell stable release is available: v7.1.2\r\n   Upgrade now, or check out the release page at:\r\n     https://aka.ms/PowerShell-Release?tag=v7.1.2\r\n```\r\n If it can understand that there's a new version why there's no command like `shell-upgrade` to auto-download and install the newer version itself? it would be great and easier to update/upgrade the shell and don't need extra stuff.",
