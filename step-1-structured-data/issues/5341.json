  "body": "Fix #5260 - with this fix, folks shouldn't run afoul of the SDK version mismatch check.\r\n\r\nNote: the branch name turns out to be a little misleading.  Read further.\r\n\r\nThe approach is to see if the dotnet in the current PATH has a compatible SDK.  Folks will have a globally installed dotnet if they've installed VS or have installed the .NET Core SDK themselves.  The global dotnet may not have access to the SDK required by PSCore.  That is, the global dotnet cannot see user local dotnet SDK installs.  So if the global dotnet doesn't have the right SDK, we prepend the path to the user's local dotnet dir.\r\n\r\nAlso, update $dotnetCLIRequiredVersion to read its value from global.json so there is one less source of the truth (for the SDK version).\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
