  "body": "PowerShell Core is moving to .NET Core 2.0 with PR #3556. Once that PR is merged, we need to review all if/def and Unix specific code to:\r\n- Clean up the code\r\n- Make sure the code make sense and is not a temporary hack\r\n\r\n#### An Example (Please remove when fixed)\r\n`Platform.InternalGetFolderPath` in `src/System.Management.Automation/CoreCLR/CorePsPlatform.cs` has the following code:\r\n```\r\n                case System.Environment.SpecialFolder.ProgramFiles:\r\n                    folderPath = \"/bin\";\r\n                    if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(folderPath)) { folderPath = null; }\r\n                    break;\r\n                case System.Environment.SpecialFolder.ProgramFilesX86:\r\n                    folderPath = \"/usr/bin\";\r\n                    if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(folderPath)) { folderPath = null; }\r\n                    break;\r\n                case System.Environment.SpecialFolder.System:\r\n                case System.Environment.SpecialFolder.SystemX86:\r\n                    folderPath = \"/sbin\";\r\n                    if (!System.IO.Directory.Exists(folderPath)) { folderPath = null; }\r\n                    break;\r\n```\r\nIt use `/bin` for `ProgramFiles`, `/usr/bin` for `ProgramFilesX86` and `/sbin` for `System` and `SystemX86`. It's not clear if this is appropriate, so code like this should be reviewed.",

      "body": "@iSazonov IntelliSense doesn't work for you? It works for me in VS Code after moving to `.csproj` file. Just run `Start-PSBuild -publish`, then open the `.csproj` file in VS Code, and if you see a prompt on top of VS Code asking to restore, just click `Close`, and things like reference resolution and IntelliSense should just work.\r\nI thought creating a `sln` file would be just as simple as opening `powershell-win-core.csproj` in VS2017 and then saving a solution file, but it turned out the `.csproj` doesn't work properly within VS2017. I haven't got the chance to figure out why and fix it.",
