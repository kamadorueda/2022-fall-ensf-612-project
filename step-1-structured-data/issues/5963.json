      "body": "I just came here to log this. The existing behavior is most unhelpful.\r\n\r\nOne thought I have that differs from the above however is in the case of `Get-Command -Syntax $someAliasName`, I was thinking I'd prefer it show the actual alias mapping, followed by the syntax for the alias, especially since aliases shouldn't be used in scripts. The thinking behind this is that 100% of the time when I would use `gcm del -syntax` (or any alias in place of `del`), I'd be using the alias to save typing, as a shorthand to get the actual syntax for the command that will be invoked, and less as a command I actually want to invoke. So my expected behavior would look more like this:\r\n\r\n```none\r\ndel -> Remove-Item\r\n\r\ndel [-Path] <string[]> [-Filter <string>] [-Include <string[]>] [-Exclude <string[]>] [-Recurse] [-Force] [-Crede\r\nntial <pscredential>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [-Stream <string[]>] [<CommonParameters>]                   \r\n                                                                                                                         \r\ndel -LiteralPath <string[]> [-Filter <string>] [-Include <string[]>] [-Exclude <string[]>] [-Recurse] [-Force] [-\r\nCredential <pscredential>] [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [-UseTransaction] [-Stream <string[]>] [<CommonParameters>]  \r\n```\r\n\r\nOr maybe the output should actually state \"NOTE: del is an alias for the Remove-Item command\", at the top or bottom of the output.",
