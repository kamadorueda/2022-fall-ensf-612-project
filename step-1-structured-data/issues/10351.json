      "body": "The Visual Studio installer includes some recent updates that should be kept in mind as we update PowerShell to the latest preview build of .NET Core.\r\n\r\nThe VS installer now replaces preview versions of .NET Core 3.0 that are installed when you upgrade the preview version of VS. I upgraded my Visual Studio Preview earlier today, and now I cannot open the projects nor build because .NET Core 3.0 preview 7 was uninstalled.\r\n\r\nI'll take note to hold off on upgrading Visual Studio Preview builds until PowerShell has upgraded to the latest .NET Core Preview release moving forward, but given how this now works it would be great if the priority for reviewing/merging these preview updates in was bumped up going forward so that there's less likelihood for contributors to be impacted by doing updates out of order.",
