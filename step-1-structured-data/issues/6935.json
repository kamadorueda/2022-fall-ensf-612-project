      "body": "Yes, extra escaping is - unfortunately - required, and for the sake of backward compatibility that won't change.\r\n\r\nIn short: you must _additionally_ `\\`-escape `\"` chars. you pass to external executables.\r\n\r\nWhile your fix works, there is no strict need to switch to `\"...\"` from `'...'`, however; the following should do as well:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ndocker image inspect 4a89600a6cab -f  '{{index .Config.Labels \\\"key\\\"}}'\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor the full story, see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2361\r\n\r\n",
