  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen using `Out-GridView -PassThru`, the user might want to select multiple items. Currently, the user can add a range to selection by holding Shift, and add a particular item to selection by holding Ctrl. It would be much better if the user can do this more easily, without holding a key.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"462\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-03-07 at 6 27 35 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4462444/76155496-7d839d00-60a1-11ea-8121-64d4f256ce42.png\">\r\n\r\nWindows File Explorer provides check-box selection. `Out-GridView` can implement this, too.\r\n\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4462444/76155548-45308e80-60a2-11ea-9155-36070c728200.PNG)\r\n",
