  "body": "Per #1437 we should be able to compile DSC Configuration. It requires `function Configuration` from PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1 in **parse** time of configuration.\n\nAt the same time `PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1` has both parts: for compile time and for runtime. Bringing the whole module is possible, but undesirable solution, since it's a separate project.\n\n~~Proposition: bring `PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1` as a post-build step.~~ \n\nUpdate: @johnkord figured out the layout of `contentFiles` in nuget package and is able to get the PSDSC module published to `publish\\Modules` folder from the nuget package directly. The PSDSC nuget package has been checked in to psl-windows-build via https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-windows-build/pull/23. The same technique can be applied to the MAML work #1469\n\nRemaining Tasks:\n- [x] Update powershell-unix to depend on PSDSC.nupkg and libmi.nupkg; Update powershell-win-core to depend on PSDSC.nupkg\n- [x] Add the unix configuration tests\n- [ ] ~~Make the same configuration tests work for both unix and windows~~ (tracked by #1713)\n",
