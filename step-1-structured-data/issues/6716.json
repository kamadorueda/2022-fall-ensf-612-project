      "body": "The referenced code takes a subset of the PowerShell syntax and turns it into .NET delegates but it is essentially a different language (e.g. no commands) . PowerShell concurrency is fundamentally based on runspaces. I wrote an RFC for a task(ish) based model of concurrency a while back [Native Support for Concurrent Programming in PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/1-Draft/RFC0023-Native-Support-for-Concurrent-Programming-in-PowerShell.md) but it hasn't gone anywhere. As far as `await` goes, I suspect doing the lift-and-split that C# does would be tricky in PowerShell (but I haven't looked at it a whole lot.) Now I do like Golang's model of concurrency with tasks and channels - maybe we should do that :-) \r\n\r\nAnyway, can you provide more specific scenarios/examples of what you'd like to do? Even if we can't do a fully general implementation, I sure there's something useful we can do.",

      "body": "Sure thing! So we are in the middle of a rewrite of https://github.com/PowerShell/Polaris to a pure PowerShell implementation and are currently using HttpListener which works fine cross-platform for now but as HttpListener doesn't seem to be getting any development love lately we're looking at the new hotness Kestrel.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working with HttpListener's event based asynchronous support and using @oising's marvelous function New-ScriptBlockCallback to provide an AsyncCallback. I was hoping to find the same thing in Kestrel but it appears that they only support the task based asynchronous pattern which I can't see an easy way to convert to an event based pattern.\r\n\r\nThe sample code that I would love to write and just have work is this sample:  (simplified from this [sample in C#](https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/blob/master/aspnetcore/fundamentals/servers/kestrel/sample2/Startup.cs))\r\n\r\n```ps\r\nImport-Module .\\lib\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.dll\r\nImport-Module .\\lib\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Diagnostics.dll\r\nImport-Module .\\lib\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting.dll\r\nImport-Module .\\lib\\Microsoft.AspNetCore.Server.Kestrel.dll\r\n\r\nclass StartUp {\r\n    [void] Configure([IApplicationBuilder]$App){\r\n        [DeveloperExceptionPageExtensions]::UseDeveloperExceptionPage($App)\r\n        [RunExtensions]::Run($App, async $context => {\r\n                param($context)\r\n                return ([Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpResponseWritingExtensions]::WriteAsync($Context.Response, \"Hello World\", [Threading.CancellationToken]::None))\r\n      })\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n#$Env:ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT = \"Development\"\r\n\r\n$WebHostBuilder = $Null\r\n[IWebHostBuilder]$WebHostBuilder = [Microsoft.AspNetCore.WebHost]::CreateDefaultBuilder()\r\n$WebHostBuilder = [WebHostBuilderExtensions]::UseStartup($WebHostBuilder, [StartUp])\r\n$WebHostBuilder = [WebHostBuilderKestrelExtensions]::UseKestrel($WebHostBuilder)\r\n$WebHost = $WebHostBuilder.Build()\r\n\r\n$Result = $WebHost.StartAsync()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is my specific use-case at the moment but I think there are quite a few other .Net projects that rely heavily on the task based asynchronous pattern that are currently fairly complex to work with natively in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts!",

      "body": "So, back when I had more ideas than the focus to complete most of them, I wrote a threads/tasks prototype extension to my old PSEventing library that could handle tasks, apm (iasyncresult) and callbacks. It got annoying as I tried to deal with runspaces, and while I had solutions, it just seemed to unwieldy and inelegant so I just got bored with it. Anyway, you may have some luck if you grok  `System.Threading.Tasks.Task.FromAsync` (APM to Task methods) and the non-public static class `System.Threading.Tasks.TaskToApm` which goes in the other direction: Task to APM.",
