  "body": "`System.Management.Automation.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable(string)` maps some environment variables when they do not exist:\n\n```\nOS => \"linux\"\nCOMPUTERNAME => HOSTNAME\nUSERNAME => USER\nHOMEPATH => HOME\nUSERPROFILE => HOME\nTMP => TMPDIR\nTEMP => TMPDIR\n```\n\nThere are a couple issues with this.\n1. They aren't true environment variables, so child processes won't see $env:HOMEPATH or $env:OS\n2. There is no mapping back to Windows\n3. Other possibly useful Windows env vars aren't there, like ProgramFiles, AppData, or LocalAppData\n\nIf we keep what we have (for portability), I think it's better to define these variables as proper environment variables at startup rather than map them when they are accessed.\n\nRegarding bullet 3, I think these map to XDG directories - do we expose those as an api or env vars?\n",
