  "body": "I've been writing automation scripts to wrap a bunch of legacy EXEs and JARs for product development environment setup, and I've come across a few that perform a write operation without a line terminator and then perform a read from the user. I generally try to redirect EXE/JAR output into the verbose channel so it doesn't mess with with the PowerShell function output. But I've noticed unless the compiled programs write a new line, before the read operation, that output cannot be redirected until after the user presses a key. Is there was way to do accomplish this or is it just a limitation of the pipeline? The programs cannot be modified, so I was just looking for a workaround to either show the output in the Verbose channel or some way to automatically answer populate the read values.\r\n\r\nI came across this on Stackoveflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34616028/how-to-send-keystroke-to-executable) but that seems a little hacky.\r\n\r\ni.e. ```'Yes' | SomeFile.exe```\r\n\r\nExample Java code\r\n```\r\nSystem.out.print(prompt);\r\nSystem.out.print(\"(Y/N): \");\r\nanswer = br.readLine();\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-beta.9\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-beta.9\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.15063\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
