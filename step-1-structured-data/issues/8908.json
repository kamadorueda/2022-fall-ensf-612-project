  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\nNote the different requirements:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction :hello\" {} # allowed single double-quote\r\nfunction hello\"\" {} #required matching double-quotes\r\nfunction global::hello\"\" {} #also requires matching double quotes\r\nfunction :hello` more {} # error, 'more' was not expected.\r\n`function hello` more {} # works fine, function name is 'hello more'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll to be consistent.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nIt seems that some rules for labels are being applied to functions who's name token directly start with a colon, as the rules seem to match, such that any character that would fail as a label character just gets consumed in to the name with no regard to the rules of that character, such as the double-quote in the first statement above, or the backtick in the 4th statement.\r\n\r\nI noticed this while trying to correct the PowerShell/EditorSyntax for function names, see https://github.com/PowerShell/EditorSyntax/pull/156 for my work.  I've noticed that a label can also be a function, and that is difficult to properly detect in a TM grammar, so I was double checking some of my matches when I noticed this, and at first thought I had the rules to function names wrong.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nTested on 5.1 Windows PowerShell and 6.2 preview\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0-preview.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0-preview.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18334\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",
