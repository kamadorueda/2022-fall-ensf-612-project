      "body": "So a couple things. The finder supports directly emptying the trash. Single command: tell application \"finder\" to empty. so a call to osascript -e works there\r\n\r\nSince the cocoa frameworks allow moving to trash easily, i'd use them, as using osascript -e for that gets a little weird since you have to have a file object which you then use in: tell application \"finder\" to move <thing> to trash. You can play some games with posix file et al, but any time the frameworks will do it, that's the better way to go.",
