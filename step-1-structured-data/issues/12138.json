The only tests currently verifying the regex patterns used are here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/920b671fb41bdaa3cfc0ce030a41e81c4860d330/test/powershell/Modules/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/WebCmdlets.Tests.ps1#L1904\r\n\r\nThe cmdlets use a half-dozen different regex patterns for various purposes; we should add tests to ensure they work correctly going forward.\r\n\r\nSee also #12099 -- both that PR and the new tests should be backported to 7.0 branch as a bugfix.\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n\r\nThis is the tool we are supposed to use:  https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security-risk-detection/\r\nThe description of the requirement are here:\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-risk-detection/concepts/seed-files\r\n",

So, until you propose exactly what site to use, I can't say if such usage would require permission from the site owner.",
