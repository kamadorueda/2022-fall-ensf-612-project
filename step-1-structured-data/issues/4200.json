  "body": "Addresses issue #4145\r\n\r\nPreviously with .NET Core, `FileNotFoundException` would be thrown if a file was deleted during an enumeration, and that issue was fixed by #3806. That behavior is changed in newer .NET Core to align with full .NET. So the tests hooks and tests added in #3806 is unneeded now and thus removed.",
