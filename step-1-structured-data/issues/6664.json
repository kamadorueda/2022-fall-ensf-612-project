We can't tell if this is an issue with PowerShell Core, Windows PowerShell, or even DOS command.\r\n\r\nWe need:\r\n\r\n1. OS type and build\r\n2. PowerShell Core Version.\r\n\r\nAgain, if this is a Windows PowerShell issue then it need to be addressed in the proper UserVoice forum (not Github) or the proper teams won't be able to work on it.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n",
