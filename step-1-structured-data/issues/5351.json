  "body": "_From @Aetylus on August 12, 2016 13:12_\n\nThe `Complete` function (using `Set-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Key Tab -Function Complete`) doesn't seem to handle files with similar names but one begins with a period. I do a lot of work in gVim while on Windows which will leave `.[filename].swp` files while open, and attempting to tab complete the filename results in PowerShell completely unwriting the whole word.\n\nTake for example a directory with `.foo.bar` and `foo.bar`. If you have `ii f`, `ii fo` or `ii foo` and attempt tab complete, it will completely rewrite your line to `ii .\\`. Same with `ii .\\f`, `ii .\\fo`, and `ii .\\foo`. Once you include the period before the file extension, it will autocomplete to `ii .\\foo.bar`.\n\n\n_Copied from original issue: lzybkr/PSReadLine#415_",
