  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a Powershell Tool designer I want a command like Start/Stop-Transcript that will capture verbose output but not display it to the console So that the user of the tool gets an easy to consume minimal console experience but there is a detailed log available in case of problems with tools that run for longer than 10 mins or if the issue is not easily reproducable.\r\n\r\nToday it seems that we either need to roll our own centralised complex logging routines or highly decorated contents of our scripts using redirection operators (something like ```Tee-Object 'filename' 4>$null```) but this does not work consistently in many scenario's\r\n\r\n### example\r\n\r\n``` powershell\r\nfunction Invoke-MyTool {\r\nStart-DetailedLog 'myfile.log'\r\nWrite-Host 'Hello World'\r\nWrite-Verbose 'Hello underworld!\r\nStop-DetailedLog 'myfile.log'\r\n}\r\n\r\nInvoke-MyTool\r\n# or perhaps \r\n# Invoke-MyTool -Verbose \r\n# either would be acceptable as long as the behaviour was defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nScreen output would be\r\n```\r\nHello World\r\n```\r\n\r\nmyfile.log would be \r\n```\r\nHello World\r\nHello underworld!\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to have timestamps on each line in the log also\r\n\r\nIf this is possible to incorporate this functionality in to Start-Transcript then that would be great",

I guessed that the Transcript method would have the advantage of not needing this wrapper\r\n\r\nI probably should have commented there, but that's very explicitly only a problem with verbose and warning. The manner in which they're written to the screen isn't controlled by formatting like everything else, but instead based on an internal property on the `PSObject` wrapping it. Everything else will be written as it's typically formatted, just those two records need a little bit of help.",
