These are community experts explaining it, not information from the authors.\r\n> > I _thought_ `.foreach()` and `.where()` were for arrays only.\r\n> \r\n> Yes, but Count works for scalar and foreach()/where() too.\r\n\r\nYes, @iSazonov I've relied on that for years...  I use `.where()`  heavily and I'm now thinking  \"Do I only use it on what I know will be an array, or do I trust it to do the right thing with a scalar.\"  \r\n\r\nThe syntax Mike's using is in about_arrays (not About_foreach) and there is a note in about_Intrinsic_Members\r\n\r\nThere are  certainly some things that are not right ... \r\n```\r\nps > $s = \"one two three\"\r\nps > $s.where({$_.length -gt 10 } )\r\none two three\r\n\r\nps > $s.where({$_.length -gt 10 } ) += \"four\"\r\nInvalidArgument: Cannot convert value \"one two three\" to type \"System.Management.Automation.WhereOperatorSelectionMode\".  Error: \"Unable to match the identifier name one two three to a valid enumerator name.
