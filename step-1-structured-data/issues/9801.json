  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell installation MSI provides a link to the project's MIT licence (see #8846).\r\n\r\nI have tested the MSI for `6.2.1` and `7.0.0 preview 1` on Windows 10 (1809) x64, both of which link [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell version number in the licence should better reflect the version of PowerShell that the user is installing.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe version in the licence is 6.0 irrespective of the version being installed by the user, see the first line of the licence file:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/83708a4242befaae0e26d7f33e7ebe2f0091db08/LICENSE.txt#L1\r\n\r\n# Possible solutions\r\n\r\n  * Change the version number in the licence file to something like `PowerShell 6.0 +` in order to accommodate 6.0 and later releases.\r\n  * Remove the version number from the licence file.\r\n  * Show only the major part of the version number, EG: `PowerShell 6 and 7`\r\n  * Change the way in which the licence is displayed to reflect the specific version being installed by the user.",
