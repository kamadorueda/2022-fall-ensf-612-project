  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nWhen I open a new terminal window/tab, I like my shell to display a random quote. In `zsh`, I do this by running `fortune` from inside my `.zshrc` file. But I **don't** want my shell to output a random quote when it's being run in some other (non-login shell) context. In `zsh`, you can do this by checking the `login` option:\r\n\r\n```zsh\r\nif [[ -o login ]]; then\r\n    fortune\r\nfi\r\n```\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you can test `-o interactive` to see if `zsh` is running interactively or not.\r\n\r\nPowerShell has a `-Login` parameter, but it doesn't appear to be an intuitive way to check for it from within my `Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1` file.\r\n\r\nIt's also not clear how to check to see if PowerShell is running interactively. There's `[Environment]::UserInteractive`, but I can't tell if that's the right thing to check or not.\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "The Engine WG discussed this today.  We think having a way to interrogate the host startup parameters more directly is a good idea.  Perhaps something like a `$PSInvocation` variable or perhaps more data hung off of `$Host`.  Which brings up a point the WG discussed.  Thought needs to be put into the implementation in terms of whether this information is provided by the `host` (not all hosts support interactive and/or login features) or by the `engine`.  Given this, we're putting this `up-for-grabs`.  We also recommend that anyone attempting to implement this, write an RFC before spending a lot of time on the implementation in order to address the `host` vs `engine` issue.",
