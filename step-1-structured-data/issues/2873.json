  "body": "On newer versions of Windows with support for ANSI colors in the console, some badly behaving executables changes the Console mode. An example is ```$env:USERPROFILE\\AppData\\Local\\GitHub\\PortableGit_d7eff...\\usr\\bin\\perl.exe``` that is installed by GitHub Desktop.\r\n\r\nBefore executing the command (perl.exe), ConsoleMode is 7 (```ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT|ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT|ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING```) and after execution it is 3 (```ENABLE_PROCESSED_OUTPUT|ENABLE_WRAP_AT_EOL_OUTPUT```)\r\n\r\nThe result is that my colored prompt output is looking like \r\n```\u001b[1;31mdev-walrus-online\u001b[0m - [D:\\ws\\walon\\TnT]```\r\n\r\nIs this something PowerShell should handle (restoring ConsoleMode) or is this by design?\r\n",
