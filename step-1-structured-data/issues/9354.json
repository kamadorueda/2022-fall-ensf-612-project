  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user I want to change the format of Powershell transcripts so that my existing tools can parse them with minimal effort. \r\n\r\nSee issues #8720 and #8402 for examples of requests for this type of functionality. \r\n\r\nI'm happy to implement this myself, just looking for feedback on the proposed technical implementation first.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\n`Start-Transcript` could accept an optional script block for each type of transcript segment: header, line and footer.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nStart-Transcript\r\n    -HeaderTemplate { \"Custom header\" }\r\n    -LineTemplate { param($command, $result) \"{input: '$command', output: '$result'}\"}\r\n\r\n    # -FooterTemplate is not specified, so falls back onto a script block defined\r\n    # in environment var, or default implementation, as in this example.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would produce the following transcript `test.txt` for a session of one command (`write-host \"test\"`) with a prompt `PS prompt>`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nCustom header\r\n{ input: '', output: 'Transcript started, output file is .\\test.txt' }\r\n{ input: 'PS prompt> write-host \"test\"', output: 'test' }\r\n{ input: 'PS prompt> Stop-Transcript', output: '' }\r\n**********************\r\nPowerShell transcript end\r\nEnd time: 20190414081054\r\n**********************\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm suggesting script blocks to allow maximum flexibility. Other cmdlets for specific formats could be built on top of this, e.g. `Start-TranscriptJson`, `Start-TranscriptXml`, `Start-TranscriptMyCustomFormat`.\r\n\r\nSince Powershell outputs to different streams, the `$result` argument to the `-LineTemplate` script block should reflect the order of outputs and to which stream. For example, a data structure like `List<Tuple<StreamType, String>>` where `StreamType` is an enumeration of the output stream types (Success, Verbose, Error, Warning, Debug). This detail is omitted from the example for the sake of simplicity for now.",
