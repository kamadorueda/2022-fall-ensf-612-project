Make any number of changes in any of the tabs, then click OK.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe expectation is that these settings would be saved.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAn error occurs:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n---------------------------\r\nError Updating Shortcut\r\n---------------------------\r\nUnable to modify the shortcut:\r\nC:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\PowerShell\\PowerShell 7 (x64).lnk.\r\nCheck to make sure it has not been deleted or renamed.\r\n---------------------------\r\nOK   \r\n---------------------------\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have seen solutions around the internet which involve steps like creating a new shortcut to the existing shortcut, yada yada (stuff that shouldn't be necessary).\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n>$PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "I agree that this should be fixed; it has come up twice before: #13148 and #7825, but both issues were closed.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7825#issuecomment-423024388 explains why this currently happens, and I also suggested the following there:\r\n\r\n> As for **what needs fixing**:\r\n\r\n> * The PowerShell installer could create a _per-user_ Start Menu shortcut for PS Core instead of a single, shared one that requires elevation to modify (as an aside, if multiple users try to customize the shortcut, the customizations could collide).\r\n\r\n>   * This is how `cmd.exe` already does it for its `Command Prompt` shortcut, which is placed in `\"$env:APPDATA\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\System Tools\"` - for every user.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Maybe I'm wrong, certainly seems like this issue is pretty specific to PowerShell, just can't think of another program to compare with because, nothing else needs to modify the shortcut to save these kinds of basic preferences.\n\nSo sick of that answer.  It's a garbage feature, period.  Windows terminal addresses this by taking over for it in this area.  That alone is enough to point out it could be addressed some other way, rather than blaming MSI.",
