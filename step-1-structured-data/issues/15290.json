We found it trying to access the internet. After we used the proxy to connect to the Internet once, it no longer requested to connect to the Internet and returned to ok.\r\n\r\nCan I close the Internet request? Or don't hung up. There is no internet in this project.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146662/115647215-fdc49a80-a355-11eb-8136-20eca83c951f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/146662/115647250-0a48f300-a356-11eb-8c9f-6691889f2978.png)\r\n\r\n",
