The SSH client used to establish the connection ends silently, without having established the subsystem connection.  The PowerShell remoting layer gets no error and remains indefinitely in a pre-connection state.  I have repro'd this only on Windows so far, but suspect the same problem exists on non-Windows platforms.\r\n\r\nI found this while investigating PowerShell SSH test hang issue.  I don't know if this is the same issue as with the automated tests, but should be fixed.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Misconfigure endpoint by providing invalid path in subsystem\r\n# sshd_config file\r\nSubsystem       powershell      E:\\InvalidPath\\publish\\pwsh.exe -SSHS -NOLOGO -NOPROFILE\r\n\r\n$session = New-PSSession -HostName localhost\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nError returned because the endpoint is invalid.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nNo error.\r\nHang.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
