  "body": "- Last PR had a typo in \"TestAruments\" which caused the configuration not to get picked up\n- Now bails appropriately if PowerShell wasn't built, instead of rebuilding it every time\n- Passes `-verbose` to the xUnit runner, not dotnet, so we can see which test failed\n- Also Make git describe work relative to script, so that you don't have to watch your CWD when running commands from the build module.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/1065)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
