  "body": "Reviewer and Assignee of a PR should be separate roles.\r\n- Reviewers do code review, and eventually approve the PR\r\n- Assignee is a maintainer, who monitors the progress of the PR, coordinates the review process, and merges PR after it's approved.\r\nWhen submitting a new PR, the author is encouraged to choose Reviewer(s) and Assignee for the PR. If either Reviewer or Assignee is left blank, maintainers will choose them for the PR.\r\nHowever, for PowerShell Team members, You are **required** to choose them yourself for the PR.\r\n**Note that**, even if you are not designated as a Reviewer for a PR, you can still feel free to jump in and review the change.\r\n\r\n**The PR author is responsible to drive the PR to the Approved state.** The author should ping the reviewer(s) when they don't respond timely enough (or event talk to them if you can). If the review process is making no progress (or too slow), the author can always contact the Assignee to help coordinate the process, for example, if the reviewer(s) don't respond back for too long, the Assignee can review the existing comments and decide if the PR is in good state or a new reviewer should be pulled in.\r\n\r\nA template will be added to pull request, to remind the author to choose Reviewer(s) and Assignee for the PR.",
