This is not an issue of types or unified anything.\r\n\r\nWe need PowerShell to do _at run time_ the same thing that nuget does at compile time:\r\n\r\n1. Developer ships set of runtime-specific folders with assemblies in them\r\n2. Developer documents the RootModule or RequiredAssembly\r\n3. User just Imports the module\r\n4. PowerShell picks the right folder, because it knows what OS/framework/runtime it is.\r\n\r\nNote that this is NOT only a linux vs Windows vs mac problem. PowerShell Core on Windows requires different assemblies than Windows PowerShell, even for _formerly simple_ things shipped by Microsoft (e.g. for [System.Drawing.Common](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Drawing.Common/)).",

And it should be addressed in C# language (enhance DllImport and marshalling because DllImport and marshalling came form Windows and is limited on Unix-es) and CoreFX/CoreCLR engine. Until that we can use workarounds like ones from initial post of the Issue.\r\n",

Then it's just a _packaging_ problem: [#PowerShellGet/273](/PowerShell/PowerShellGet/issues/273)\r\n\r\n",
