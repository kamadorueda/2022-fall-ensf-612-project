This way one would know if it is a problem of `PowerShell` or `Win32-OpenSSH.`\r\nYou said that SSH is aready installed on the Windows IOT device. Could it be that it has not all features enabled? In the early days, 'installation' consisted of extracting the package and running some scripts to enable SSH server/agent features (i.e. the Windows Services `sshd` and `ssh-agent`). The documentation is still [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/wiki/Install-Win32-OpenSSH). On Windows Server machines, I install it using chocolatet this way: `choco install -y openssh -params '\"/SSHServerFeature /SSHAgentFeature\"'`\r\nThis is as much as I can help you with. But keep in mind that ARM support of PowerShell is experimental at the moment and that `Win32-OpenSSH` is still in pre-release state.",
