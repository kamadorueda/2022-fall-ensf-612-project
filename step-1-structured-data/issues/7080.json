  "body": "Heya! Using PSCore 6.1 preview 2, when cancel a command with Ctrl C, the following dialog pops up:\r\n\r\n    Terminate batch job (Y/N)?\r\n\r\nI understand why this exists, but I'd also like the option to disable it, so cancelling cancels immediately. [Judging by Stack Overflow, I'm not the only one](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39085380/how-can-i-suppress-terminate-batch-job-y-n-confirmation-in-powershell)\r\n\r\nSo a request: could we have an environment variable to control this?\r\n\r\n",

Despite this, there's no `cmd` processes (according to process explorer or `get-process`)when I run long running commands in powershell. \r\n\r\n@BrucePay can you explain this further? Why is cmd being used here? Is cmd being used as an interpreter or some other part of the console? Thanks!",
