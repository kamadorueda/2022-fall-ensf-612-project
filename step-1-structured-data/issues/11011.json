  "body": "Using DPAPI in a remote PSSession requires using `-Authentication Credssp` so that the creds are forwarded.\r\n\r\nCreating a remote session from Linux to Windows only works using `-Authentication Negotiate`. This precludes the use of DPAPI.\r\n\r\nAs a user I want to be able to encrypt data using DPAPI in a remote session created from a Linux host so that I can secure my data.\r\n\r\nI appreciate this would be non-trivial to achieve but I have no idea if is is even feasible at all.\r\n",

So this request is for an alternative.",
