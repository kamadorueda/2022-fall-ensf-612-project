  "body": "_Update_:\r\n\r\nThe decision in #8603 to rely on `Console.Clear()` amounts to inconsistent behavior across platforms, for no good reason (there's no native behavior that needs to be emulated; native behavior, if desired, is accessible via the external `clear` utility).\r\n\r\nIf there's consensus that the desired behavior is to consistently clear the screen _and_ the scrollback buffer on all platforms, we have two options:\r\n\r\n* Wait for  `Console.Clear()` to be fixed, if ever - see https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/34463\r\n\r\n* Roll our own solution in PowerShell [in the meantime].\r\n\r\nThe original proposal below was written under the assumption that platform-dependent behavior was intended, and therefore suggested an opt-in mechanism.\r\n\r\n# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nImplement a switch named `-All` to direct `Clear-Host` to clear not only the current screen of terminal (console) hosts but to clear the scrollback buffer (the output history) as well.\r\n\r\n`Clear-Host` now uses `[Console]::Clear()` (see #8603), which results in platform-specific behavior:\r\n\r\n* Unix-like platforms: clears the current screen (terminal-window content) only.\r\n* Windows: clears the current screen _and_ the scroll-back buffer.\r\n\r\nThat is, also clearing the scrollback buffer is invariably implied on Windows, whereas it is currently unavailable on Unix-like platforms.\r\n\r\nImplementing `-All` would allow users to at least opt into a consistent cross-platform experience, e.g. via  a user-defined function such as `function clsa { Clear-Host -All }`.\r\n\r\nNote: As before, this means that in the Windows console you do not have the option to selectively clear the current screen only, without erasing the scrollback buffer.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nIf `-All` is specified:\r\n\r\n* on Windows: do nothing, because clearing the scrollback buffer is _invariably_ performed anyway.\r\n* on Unix-like platforms, execute ``$host.ui.Write(\"`e[3J\")``  after `[Console]::Clear()` to also clear the scrollback buffer.\r\n",

YMMV. \r\n\r\n@JamesWTruher @joeyaiello IIRC, the thrust of what we discussed in the committee meeting is that PowerShell would call `Console.Clear()` on all 'console' platforms and the CoreCLR team would implement the appropriate behaviour on each platform.  If the CoreCLR isn't doing the right thing on a platform, then a bug should be opened in the CoreCLR repo.  ***BUT(!) we do still need to go through the `$Host.UI.RawUI` APIs in order to support 'non-console' platforms like remoting.*** In fact, if the `RawUI` APIs were fully supported on non-Windows console hosts, this whole discussion might be moot.\r\n",
