      "body": "Hex and binary aren't types. They're just a different way of writing a number. I don't think it's feasible or particularly useful to make pseudo-types for this. If you want a hex string of a number, you can do `$number.ToString('X')`, and if you want to get the hexadecimal representation of a string, you can use `$string | Format-Hex`.\r\n\r\nThere may be improvements to be had in discoverability there, but I don't think type accelerators are the way to go. They communicate the wrong thing here; these aren't separate types... just different ways of expressing the same data. That's the primary reason there _are_ separate `ToString()` modes for a lot of types.\r\n\r\nIn future, please take the time to fill out the actual issue template so that we can get a proper understanding of why you feel this kind of thing is important, as well. There are details requested in the issue templates that you don't tend to think to provide when you ignore them. \ud83d\ude42 ",
