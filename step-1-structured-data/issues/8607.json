  "body": "This issue is about an incorrect validation of the `Test-Path` cmdlet.\r\n\r\nWhen a path ends with a backslash it is supposed to be a **container**.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, according to the official documentation:\r\n\r\n> -IsValid\r\n> Indicates that this cmdlet tests the syntax of the path, regardless of whether the elements of the path exist. This cmdlet returns `$True` if the path syntax is valid and `$False` if it is not.\r\n\r\nand also\r\n\r\n> \"Leaf. An element that does not contain other elements, such as a file.\"\r\n\r\n[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/test-path?view=powershell-6](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/test-path?view=powershell-6)\r\n\r\nHowever, when using the `-IsValid` parameter combined to the `-PathType Leaf` parameter in order to validate the syntax of a file path, it is incorrectly validated as a **leaf**.\r\n\r\nFor example, the following command line returns `$true` instead of `$false`.\r\n\r\n`PS C:\\> Test-Path -IsValid -PathType Leaf -Path 'C:\\Something\\'`\r\n`True`\r\n`PS C:\\>`\r\n\r\nIt should return false because a leaf path cannot end with a backslash.\r\n\r\nThis behavior has been tested on PowerShell 5.1 and 6.1.1.",

      "body": "Hi @fullenw1 There are a couple of things to be aware of here. First, if  `-IsValid` is specified, the `-PathType` switch is simply ignored and syntactic path validation is the only thing that's done:\r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore  >  Test-Path -IsValid foo -PathType leaf\r\nTrue\r\nPSCore  >  Test-Path -IsValid foo -PathType Container\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\nSecond, when it is used by itself, `-PathType` tests the type of the _object the path resolves to_, regardless of the _path string_: \r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore  >  test-path -PathType Container $profile/\r\nFalse\r\nPSCore  >  test-path -PathType Leaf $profile/\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\nLikewise, when using the `Split-Path` cmdlet, the trailing slash is ignored. \r\n```powershell\r\nPSCore  >  Split-Path -Leaf a\\b\\c\\\r\nc\r\n```\r\nArguably `-IsValid` and `-PathType` should have been in separate parameter sets but that isn't how it was implemented and it would be a breaking change to do it now.",
