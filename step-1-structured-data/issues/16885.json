  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nAs a user I want\r\n* Intuitive module management, like Python or TypeScript\r\n* Minimal overhead to creating modules\r\n\r\nCurrently, to create a module, you must export the members either by specifying them in your module manifest or using `Export-ModuleMember`.  The former is tedious for unpublished modules (modules only used for internal code reuse within a project) and the latter seems unintuitive to call a function to support a language construct.\r\n\r\nI would like to declaratively specify which module members (at least functions) are exportable by applying a new `[Export]` attribute on the function.\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
