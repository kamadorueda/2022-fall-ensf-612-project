  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThe different streams coming from powershell would be more useful if they were in a format like json and included metadata like logging level, function, datetime, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to have a straightforward way to customize the logging in powershell without having to use custom logging functions.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n* If I'm running powershell scripts as a scheduled task or in a container I would like to be able to ship the logs to log management via a log collector\r\n* Include information other than the message itself automatically using structured logs. Information like a timestamp, severity, or other information like memory usage, cpu time, pid, etc\r\n* Simplify parsing the log for important messages like warnings/errors and allow the logs to be more consumable by a machine\r\n",
