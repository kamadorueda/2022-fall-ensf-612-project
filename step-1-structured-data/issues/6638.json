  "body": "The current way to deal with circular references is the `Depth` parameter. Its default value is too low and increasing it doesn't address a usual use case where the object is deep and doesn't contain any circular reference. \r\n\r\nAdd a `CircularDetection` switch parameter.\r\nOnce a circular reference is detected, throw an exception. If the switch is not present, cap the object by the depth limit.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCurrently no exception is thrown when the depth limit is reached. This easily propagates the error and may remain undetected until the collected data is evaluated. One option to consider is to make the detection default. The switch can be changed to `-DisableCircularDetection` which enables the current behavior. This is a breaking change for some users.\r\n\r\n#### Unaffected groups of users:\r\n\r\n- Those who use the `Depth` parameter.\r\n- Those who use shallow objects falling bellow the depth limit.\r\n- Those who use deep objects without circular references, but are not aware of or affected by the silent error.\r\n\r\n#### Affected groups of users:\r\n\r\n- Those who use objects with circular references while the very low depth limit doesn't affect them.",
