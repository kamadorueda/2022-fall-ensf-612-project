You can use win32 API's (or I think sysinternals might have a tool for it?) to set something up like this yourself, but if you'd like the feature baked into conhost/terminal you'd want to file the issue on [microsoft/terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) or feedback hub/user voice.",

      "body": "PowerShell doesn't control how it is displayed on screen, it has to be run inside a terminal program like PowerShell ISE, or Visual Studio Code, or the most basic one is Windows Console Host. It's up to them to be \"always on top\" or not, and I don't think any of them have that option.\r\n\r\nIf you are willing to try another terminal program, [ConEmu](https://conemu.github.io/) is a popular one which can run PowerShell and has [Always on top settings](https://conemu.github.io/en/SettingsAppearance.html).",
