  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nHello everyone, I'm working with PWSH, the idea in general is have a ps1 file with the definition of several scriptblocks and select one (to have control of the version to execute). To get the block I'm using the function Write-Output to return it. But it throw a weir error. \r\n\r\nThis problem only happen with the ScriptBlock, I checked the expected object of Write-Output:\r\n\r\nWrite-Output [-InputObject] <psobject> [-NoEnumerate] [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n@{}.GetType() -> System.Object\r\n{}.GetType() -> System.Object\r\n\r\nIs possible write a hashtable, and the both are System.Object.\r\n\r\nObviously, you can have different workarounds:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-Command -ScriptBlock $([Scriptblock]::Create((Write-Output -InputObject {Write-Host 'Hello block!'}.ToString())));\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-Command -ScriptBlock $(Write-Output -InputObject $([psobject]@{\"Command\"={Write-Host 'Hello block!'}})).Command\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> Write-Output -InputObject {write-host 'Hello world!'}\r\nwrite-host 'Hello world!'\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> Write-Output -InputObject {write-host 'Hello world!'}\r\nWrite-Output: Cannot evaluate parameter 'InputObject' because its argument is specified as a script block and there is no input. A script block cannot be evaluated without input.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nWrite-Output: Cannot evaluate parameter 'InputObject' because its argument is specified as a script block and there is no input. A script block cannot be evaluated without input.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nPS> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0\r\nOS                             Linux 5.14.18-100.fc33.x86_64 #1 SMP Fri Nov 12 17:38:44 UTC 2021\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
