  "body": "The readme for the [Powershell Docker Hub Repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/powershell/) does not follow the typical format of a Docker Hub readme and is therefore not very useful in the context of Docker.  I would say one of the most important aspects is missing.  The readme should include a list of what the active tags are and provide links to the Dockerfiles they were generated from.  The readme should be explaining how to use the Docker images.  Using the GitHub readme is not appropriate in this context.  See https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/ as a reference for the type of content that is expected.",
