Basically we'll have difficulty making sure the environment is passed correctly through when we exec. It might be possible for us to flush the .NET env store into the actual process environment before we exec perhaps.\r\n\r\nI'd like the understand the scenario a bit better if we can. I understand that PID 1 is special and has its own Linux namespace, but what's the constraint on the container scenario here? Is only one process allowed?\r\n\r\nMy thinking here is I'm not sure we can make this behave well enough in general that we can support it nicely.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm not sure `Start-Process` is the right place to put the logic:\r\n\r\n- We're not starting a new process\r\n- We'll be using entirely new logic, so it's not a simple perturbation from the current implementation",

If that proves useful or popular, we can consider whether it should be a part of the standard PowerShell release. But in general, our preference is for new commands to go into modules unless they really make sense at the heart of PowerShell, since the module system and the gallery lower the friction of getting new functionality",
