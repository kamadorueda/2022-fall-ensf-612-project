  "author": "adityapatwardhan",
  "body": "- Fixed the way common test modules are passed to elevated and unelevated powershell. Earlier, only elevated powershell got those through inheritance as a child process. Now we add them to the startup of the process.\r\n\r\n- Fixed error reported by PSScriptAnalyzer about ? / Where-Object\r\n\r\n- Converted all the parameters passed to powershell.exe to be a base64 encoded string to avoid complications with quotes.\r\n\r\n- Removed code which was updated $env:PSModulePath as we do it in startup args for powershell process instead. \r\n\r\n- Added a way to disable -Quiet for Pester.",
