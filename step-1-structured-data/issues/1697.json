  "body": "- [x] Addresses issue #1440.\n- [x] Code is [rebased][sync] on `origin/master`.\n\nThe is the last bug blocking side-by-side remoting on Nano Server. The root cause of this issue was that M.P.ALC.dll was getting included in the TPA list twice. Once for the side by side PSHOME and once for the inbox location. This caused CoreCLR to load the inbox version of the assembly when it should load the side-by-side version instead.\n",
