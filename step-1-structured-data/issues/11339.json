' # dot-sourcing (trailing space disambiguates)\r\n\r\nGet-Help '&' # default to call operator over background operator, print hint for how to look up the background operator\r\nGet-Help ' &' # background operator (leading space disambiguates)\r\n\r\nGet-Help '@' # default to splatting, but print hint for how to look up @() and @'...'@\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt would also be helpful to be able to output a concise table of operators, along the following lines:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Not sure what the best syntax is here; maybe include it in about_Operators with links to\r\n# the operator-specific descriptions.\r\n# Note the 'LookupName' column which shows how to resolve ambiguities.\r\nPS> Get-Help about_OperatorTable\r\n```\r\n```none\r\nName         FriendlyName                                Category        LookupName\r\n----         ------------                                --------        ----------\r\n--%          stop-parsing symbol                         ArgumentPassing\r\n@            splatting                                   ArgumentPassing\r\n-            subtraction / sign inversion                Arithmetic\r\n*            multiplication / string replication         Arithmetic\r\n...\r\n+            addition / string concatenation              Arithmetic\r\n,            array constructor                           Array\r\n..           range (numbers/characters)                  Array\r\n--           decrement                                   Assignment\r\n-=           compound assignment                         Assignment\r\n...\r\n-band        bitwise AND                                 Bitwise\r\n-bNot        bitwise complement                          Bitwise\r\n...\r\n?:           ternary conditional                         Conditional\r\n??           null-coalescing                             Conditional\r\n-contains    collection contains RHS                     Containment\r\n-in          LHS contained in RHS                        Containment\r\n-notContains collection doesn't contain RHS              Containment\r\n-notIn       LHS not contained in collection             Containment\r\n-eq          equality                                    Equality\r\n-ge          greater-than-or-equal                       Equality\r\n# ...\r\n@()          array-subexpression                         Evaluation\r\n$()          subexpression                               Evaluation\r\n.
