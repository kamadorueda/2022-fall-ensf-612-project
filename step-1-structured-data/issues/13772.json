That index needs to be initiated and increased with each iteration, something like:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$Index = 0\r\n'A'..'E' | Where-Object { $Index++ -notin 1, 3 }\r\n```\r\nThis is also required in a other situations, as shown in StackOverflow questions along with:\r\n* [Combine single arrays into columns](https://stackoverflow.com/q/23411202/1701026)\r\n* [Make array elements as the keys of hashtable](https://stackoverflow.com/q/60538325/1701026)\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nIf there would be an automated index variable, these solutions could be simplified to:\r\n\r\n### #13769 NotIndex\r\n```PowerShell\r\n'A'..'E' | Where-Object { $PSIndex -notin 1, 3 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Select odd rows\r\n```PowerShell\r\n'A'..'E' | Where-Object { $PSIndex % 2 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Combine single arrays into columns](https://stackoverflow.com/q/23411202/1701026)\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$Column1 = 1..3\r\n$Column2 = 4..6\r\n\r\n$Column1 | Foreach-Object {\r\n    [pscustomobject]@{ Column1 = $_; Column2 = $Column2[$PSIndex] }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### [Make array elements as the keys of hashtable](https://stackoverflow.com/q/60538325/1701026)\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$Keys = 1,2,3\r\n$Values = 'One', 'Two', 'Three'\r\n\r\n$HashTable = @{}\r\n$Keys | Foreach-Object { $HashTable[$_] = $Values[$PSIndex] }\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Fundamental test (expectation)\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$Collection | Foreach-Object {\r\n    $Collection[$PSIndex].Equals($PSItem) | Should -BeTrue\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n* I suspect that there already internally exists an index to support parameters like `-Index` and `-Skip` in the `Select-Object` cmdlet but I have no clue if that is available for every cmdlet in the pipeline\r\n* The automatic index variable for every cmdlet in the pipeline (and methods like `.Where{ $PSIndex ... }` ?) should all refer to a different index: ` 1..5 | % { $PSIndex } | ... | { $PSIndex }` (as also the case with `$_`/`$PSItem`)\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "As suggested in the linked issue [`#14724` implement indexer in loop](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14724), I think this purpose should be limited to cmdlets that initiate a new `$_` / `$PSItem` where **`@($Input)[$PSIndex] <=> $PSItem`** (as in the original purpose), meaning that `$PSIndex` always falls into step with `$PSItem` (no `$PSItem`, means no `$PSIndex`).\r\n\r\n**The way pipelines work it's significantly _more_ important to have an index** because it is possible to retrieve an object from a collection by its index but not visa versa (retrieve the index from a collection by the object). Meaning, a pipeline index should prevent scripters from stalling the whole pipeline by using an index iterator instead (or having to create their own index) where for an in-memory-collection you can simply start from the index:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$Collection = ...                               # this should be avoided as it stalls the pipeline, but is required for:\r\nFor ($i = 0; $i -lt $Collection.Count; $i++) {  # or something like (0..($Collection.Count - 1)).ForEach\r\n    $Item = $Collection[$i]                     # But if the $Collection is in memory anyways, this isn't an issue\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo prevent that `PSIndex` falls apart in nested loops. I suggest a similar common parameter as [`-PipelineVariable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_commonparameters?view=powershell-7.1#pipelinevariable) for `$_` / `$PSItem`, something like: **`-PipelineIndex`** (alias `-pi`?).\r\n\r\n",

The `-Index` parameter on `Select-Object` is implemented by [a counter in Select-Object](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/75b5813f8472b931a0ebcadbf5fec69e1adb3b8f/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Select-Object.cs#L744) which only gets instantiated and incremented when you specify the `-Index` (or `-SkipIndex`) parameter. There can't be a single pipeline counter: the count is different for every command in the pipeline, since any command in the pipeline can output additional things, pass input through, filter input, etc.\r\n\r\nSetting that aside: we definitely should not add a counter property to the `$_` pipeline object, because you will step on something. You don't know what properties the thing has, and there's no property you can add which you can guarantee won't interfere with an existing property. For instance, what would happen if you did:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n1..5 | foreach { $_.Index; $_ } | foreach { $_.Index; $_ } \r\n```\r\n\r\nDo you want `$PSIndex` to be set in the `-Begin` block or the `-End` block? I assume not. In that case, I can imagine implementing this as a $PSIndex iteration counter, something that would exist everywhere there's a `$PSItem` ... \r\n\r\nBut doing so could be expensive if **every** `foreach` created a counter and incremented it in every loop, even when it's not used. It could even cause overflows if more than `[int]::MaxValue` or `[int64]::MaxValue` items went through the pipeline...\r\n\r\nYou know that `ForEach-Object` supports multiple process blocks, right:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n'a'..'f' | ForEach-Object @(\r\n    { $i = $j = $k = 0 } # begin\r\n    { $i++; \"I:$i = $_\"; }\r\n    { $j++; \"J:$j = $_\" }\r\n    { $k++; \"K:$k = $_\" }\r\n    { \"Total: \" + ($i + $j + $k) } # end\r\n) | ForEach-Object @(\r\n    { $l = 0; $m = 0 } # begin\r\n    {\r\n        $l++; \"L:$l = $_\"; \r\n        'm'..'p' | ForEach-Object {\r\n             $m++; if($m -gt 75) { \"We got $m of these\" }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n)\r\n```",

Knowing that omitting initializers (like `{ $i = $j = $k = 0 } # begin`), might appear to work fine for a novice scripter, but could cause a terrible issue on the long run when the same variable is used in a higher scope (where counters use to have a simply common name like:  `$i` and `$Count`). In other words, a self-initializing index could prevent a PowerShell gotcha.",
