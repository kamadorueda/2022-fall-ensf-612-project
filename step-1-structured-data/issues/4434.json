  "body": "PowerShell control of O365 User/Contact/Group object's data is not propagated. For example using set-msoluser to set the user's title works to set the msol object. If I fetch the same user (using the ExternalDirectoryObjectId) with get-user, the title never shows up. This same behavior happens if I initially set a property value with the Office portal UI, I see the change on the msol object but never on the get-user object. Also, if I set a user's data with set-mailuser, I never see the change in the portal UI or in the msol object. What can I do to get the data sync'd? This happens with user, contact, and group properties. The O365 test tenant is stand-alone and is not dir-sync'd. If the property is set when the object is created then it propagates correctly. ",
