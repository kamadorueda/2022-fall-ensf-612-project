  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSimply running `Get-Volume` is all that's required to reproduce the problem.  The first time the command is issued, $null is returned.  Subsequent requests work OK until PowerShell is not used for a while, and then the issue appears again.\r\n\r\nI have many drives on my system (at least 5 and often more if external backup drives are connected).  I'm not sure if this is a factory.\r\n\r\nThe problem did not seem to occur on the 7.0.6 release which I used for a very long time.  I recently moved to the 7.2.x releases and the problem appeared and is something I have to workaround in all my scripts or it affects my work daily.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nGet-Volume should always return drive information.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nGet-Volume returns $null on the first attempt, and returns results afterwards.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nN/A\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\nN/A",

I will try `Import-Module storage` a few times over the coming days and see if it shows anything interesting.  This could indeed be a bug that's been introduced in Windows 11 specifically, it is a little hard to say because there was a short timespan between my upgrade to PS 7.2.x and Windows 11.\r\n\r\nOh while writing all that, I reproduced the problem directly using `Get-CimInstance`:\r\n\r\n```\r\nC:\\Users\\Fots> import-module storage\r\nC:\\Users\\Fots> import-module storage\r\nC:\\Users\\Fots> Get-CimInstance -ClassName MSFT_Volume -Namespace ROOT/Microsoft/Windows/Storage\r\nC:\\Users\\Fots> Get-CimInstance -ClassName MSFT_Volume -Namespace ROOT/Microsoft/Windows/Storage\r\n\r\nDriveLetter FriendlyName       FileSystemType DriveType HealthStatus OperationalStatus SizeRemaining      Size\r\n----------- ------------       -------------- --------- ------------ ----------------- -------------      ----\r\nH           Software Archive 2 NTFS           Fixed     Healthy      OK                      1.72 TB   4.55 TB\r\nD           Overflow           NTFS           Fixed     Healthy      OK                    270.84 GB 687.37 GB\r\nE           Kontakt Libraries  NTFS           Fixed     Healthy      OK                    210.97 GB   1.29 TB\r\n            Work Windows 10    NTFS           Fixed     Healthy      OK                     44.88 GB 244.12 GB\r\nI           Fotsies Backup 2   NTFS           Fixed     Healthy      OK                      2.78 TB   3.64 TB\r\nF           Sample Packs       NTFS           Fixed     Healthy      OK                    679.57 MB  56.37 GB\r\nC           Windows 11         NTFS           Fixed     Healthy      OK                    185.79 GB 488.17 GB\r\nG           Backup             NTFS           Fixed     Healthy      OK                    762.68 GB   1.82 TB\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'll notice the first call returned nothing at all.\r\n\r\n**Edit**: Sorry, I accidentally clicked the wrong button, reopened the issue \ud83d\ude04  If anyone can please add the appropriate label back, I'd appreciate it.",
