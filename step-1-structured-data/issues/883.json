The secure [environment variable](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings) we use to authenticate with GitHub (because the repo is still private) is only available to PRs made inside this repo.\n\nSimplest solution is to push directly to PowerShell/PowerShell and open a new PR.\n",
