ForEach-Object -Parallel runs in the foreground and can display progress as it goes. So it would be more practical and easier to use for some use-cases (such as installing software on multiple computers in at the same time).\n\nI think a parallel loop should be able to handle anything that a normal ForEach-Object loop can.",

      "body": "This appears to be an error in the Restart-Computer cmdlet.  When I run it alone in the latest preview build, it restarts the remote computer as expected, but never returns and eventually crashes PowerShell.  I get the same behavior when running it within a foreach -parallel script block.\r\n\r\nThis appears to have nothing to do with foreach -parallel, except that foreach -parallel doesn't currently support progress data (by design) and so there is no indicator of how the computer restart is proceeding.\r\n\r\nI feel this Issue should be closed and two new issues open:\r\n  a. Restart-Computer -cn <name> -Force -Wait -Timeout is broken in latest build.\r\n  b. ForEach -Parallel to support progress data stream (not sure how this would work and it would be a new feature request anyway).",
