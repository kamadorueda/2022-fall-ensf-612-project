  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSummarize #3232 to get working _in the same way on all platforms_:\r\n\r\n`sudo Remove-Item foo.txt` where foo.txt is owned by root\r\n\r\n[See also](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3232#issuecomment-565936036)\r\n\r\nWe have two common scenario for sudo - run a native command and run a script.\r\n\r\n1. Run a native command\r\nThis can be easily implemented like:\r\n```powersherll\r\nStart-Process <nativecommand> -ArgumentList \u2026 -Credential $userCred -Wait\r\n```\r\nSide effect on Windows: new window will be opened because:\r\n- Windows does not allow elevate current process\r\n- Windows does not allow attach elevated process to current console\r\n [.Net Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.processstartinfo.createnowindow?view=netframework-4.8#remarks) (and I guess Windows API too) doesn't allow to run new process attached to the same console.\r\nSo we can not get elevated `Start-Process pwsh -NoNewWindow -Credential $cred`\r\n\r\n2. Run a script\r\n2.1. We could implement this as for native command:\r\n```powersherll\r\nStart-Process pwsh -ArgumentList \"-c\",\"<scriptblockstring>\" -Credential $userCred -Wait\r\n```\r\n\r\n2.2. We could implement this in most power way using PowerShell remoting:\r\n```powersherll\r\nInvoke-Command -ComputerName LocalHost -ScriptBlock <scriptblock> -Credential $userCred -ArgumentList ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Current implementation proposal is 2.2.\r\nAlternative proposal - [start another pwsh process](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3232#issuecomment-500506716)\r\n\r\n#### Proposed name\r\n\r\n- __pssudo__ to avoid a conflict with Unix native sudo.\r\n- Invoke-AsUser\r\n\r\n#### Proposed UX behavior\r\n\r\n- interactively ask for credentials at first run\r\n- store credentials for a time and doesn't ask in follow runs\r\n\r\nIt is still not clear:\r\n- PowerShell remoting to localhost by default has disabled elevated accounts in WinRM loopback - how could we address this in the context sudo? Even if PowerShell remoting does not allow us to do sudo by default, we could implement it turned off by default or allow only for an interactive session.\r\n- PS sudo implementation should works over any transport - WinRM and SSH. But again there is a question about elevation in loopback -  regardless of a protocol, security should remain at the same level, which implies that SSH loopback should behave the same as for WinRM taking in account how Windows internals work but currently SSH loopback works (with manual connection).",

      "body": "This has been discussed on and off.\r\n\r\nThere are a few thoughts that I haven't seen in the other thread. Since that one is focused more on the UX, I'll do the dump on implementation here.\r\n\r\nBasically because PowerShell runs everything except for native commands in-process, this is very tricky.\r\n\r\nThere are essentially two options, both with significant drawbacks.\r\n\r\n1. `sudo` becomes an alias to a remote/subprocess invocation in PowerShell to an Administrator/root process, where it runs the given command and gives back the result. This works fine for native commands, but for cmdlets only gives back deserialised objects. It also means that to make things performant we basically need to set up a persistent remote root session to host those commands. The main drawback is then the deserialisation (`sudo` cmdlets work subtly differently from non-sudo), with the two other drawbacks of having to override `sudo` (makes sense, but not ideal) and having to manage the security boundary and lifetime of the administrator remote host.\r\n\r\n2. PowerShell itself becomes a `setuid` command and `sudo` works in process as a builtin (again we must override the util), becoming an administrator process when a `sudo` command is run. The major drawbacks here are (1) being a `setuid` command makes PowerShell quite dangerous and requires authentication to use in whatever scenario and (2) upgrading the entire process to root does not cater to the abstraction of runspaces or indeed any threading at all.\r\n\r\nGiven the two options, I really don't like either of them, but certainly think (2) is the more flawed and should be excluded at the outset.\r\n\r\nThis is just a braindump off the top of my head, so feel free to share, expand on or poke holes in implementation ideas here.",

Check [Luke Sampson's sudo.ps1](https://github.com/lukesampson/psutils/blob/master/sudo.ps1) implementation. This doesnt work if you want to redirect StdIn/StdOut. So on my own implementation [gsudo](https://github.com/gerardog/gsudo) (windows-only) I did a workaround for this scenario capturing StdIn/Out/Err and streaming via RPC to the non-elevated instance (when redirected, as in 'gsudo dir > somefile'.\r\n",

The Terminal, or more specific the terminal emulator software is trustworthy.\r\n> 3. The command that he wants to elevate is trustworthy.\r\n> \r\n> What was uac designed for regarding enterprises?\r\n> From what I've read it was designed to help admins to \"not shoot them selves into the food that easily\", e.g. \"del /S /Q C:\" in the search bar... Basically it provides a kind of \"-WhatIf\".\r\n> And regarding private and/or standalone computers?\r\n> It just inadvertently helps to obey good security habits of two separate user accounts for non administrative and administrative tasks. For the advantage of having separate contexts at all, because most people just have used the administrative account for everything including browsing the internet and so on.\r\n> \r\n> I'd be totally fine with the attach to unprivileged process solution, as it provides the same guarantee uac currently does, but also for comandline applications. Also it is a feature that could be made to be disableable, like uac.\r\n> \r\n> But anyway, we do not need to start from scratch for the security part, there is already something similar that we can hook onto its called _UIAccess_ _Applications_: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-allow-uiaccess-applications-to-prompt-for-elevation-without-using-the-secure-desktop\r\n> \r\n> > <img alt=\"\" width=\"48\" src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/33f806df33d5e02f85f614b0b73745ce34fcf1ac/68747470733a2f2f646f63732e6d6963726f736f66742e636f6d2f656e2d75732f6d656469612f6c6f676f732f6c6f676f2d6d732d736f6369616c2e706e67\">**[User Account Control Allow UIAccess applications to prompt for elevation without using the secure desktop (Windows 10) - Windows security](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-account-control-allow-uiaccess-applications-to-prompt-for-elevation-without-using-the-secure-desktop)**Best practices and more for the policy setting, User Account Control Allow UIAccess applications to prompt for elevation without using the secure desktop.\r\n\r\nSo, how does this enable us to elevate a running powershell session?\r\n\r\nThought.

      "body": "@minecraftchest1 The cleanest implementation would be an addition to windows internals it self. It would provide the most standardized way of handling this especially because this is a core functionality that not only PowerShell is looking for.\r\n\r\nBut that said there are different ways to implement it.\r\n1. The pipe based one I explained above.\r\n2. Create a service that either runs with LocalSystem privileges or with an user having SeTcbPrivilege (Act as part of the operating system) and that service than could perform the call to GetTokenInformation/SetTokenInformation with TokenLinkedToken (or even full impersonation) on behalf of the actual application and therefore bypass UAC (the official way) and elevating the already running application/thread (after checking permissions of course).\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\nAfter thinking a bit more about this. It doesn't work quite that easily as windows doesn't allow to change/overwrite the primary token of a process after it was launched (maaybe a kernel driver could do that though). But even that we could work around. But than we'd have two use cases:\r\n1. Elevating native applications\r\n2. Elevating PowerShell cmdlets/functions/Win32-Api-Calls/\u2026\r\n\r\nFor the 1st one we could just use:\r\n1. Invoker process calls \"sudo notepad.exe\"\r\n2. sudo creates a new but suspended process for notepad.exe and invokes an IPC call to the helper process (running with SeTcbPrivileges, SeDebugPrivilege, SeCreateTokenPrivilege and SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege).\r\n3. The helper process than duplicates the token of the calling process checks its privileges according to predefined rules for elevation (like /etc/sudoers on linux) than either crafts a new one (if another user should be impersonated) or just uses the linked token (if the user is an administrator but the process is currently running as invoker).\r\n4. The helper process than injects the token into the suspended process using the token acquired in the previous step.\r\n5. The helper process than resumes the suspended process and returns control back to the caller.\r\n6. The sudo process now acts as a proxy in between the unprivileged and the privileged process and forwards stdin/stdout/stderr.\r\n\r\nFor the 2nd one we would have to do a bit more advanced handling:\r\n1. Modify the PSSession stuff in powershell to be an interface (e.g. so that *-PSSession is transport-agnostic and that anyone can implement new kinds of transportation).\r\n2. Create a new kind of PSSession (in addition to SSH and WinRM) that will connect two PowerShell processes one being elevated and the other one not.\r\n3. Call `sudo powershell-IPCSession.exe` (for details about what sudo does see above) in the background\r\n4. `powershell-IPCSession.exe` once started spawns a new powershell session and connects it to the named pipe created by the non privileged process.\r\n5. The non privileged process now can perform elevated actions within this session via the IPC pipe.",

Pipeline inputs and outputs are automatically serialized and deserialized.\r\n\r\nExample usage from the [docs](https://gerardog.github.io/gsudo/docs/usage/powershell#invoke-gsudo-cmdlet).\r\n\r\n> ``` powershell\r\n> # Accepts pipeline input.\r\n> Get-process SpoolSv | Invoke-gsudo { Stop-Process -Force }\r\n> \r\n> # Variable usage\r\n> $folder = \"C:\\ProtectedFolder\"\r\n> Invoke-gsudo { Remove-Item $using:folder }\r\n> \r\n> # The result is serialized (PSObject) with properties.\r\n> (Invoke-gsudo { Get-ChildItem $using:folder }).LastWriteTime\r\n> ```\r\n> \r\n\r\n(The cmdlet is optional, you can still just prepend `gsudo` to [elevate a command string](https://gerardog.github.io/gsudo/docs/usage/powershell))\r\n\r\nSorry if I am spamming this thread. I thought that mentioning it here once was on-topic.
