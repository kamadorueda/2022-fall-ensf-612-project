Ctrl-D isn't any shortcut, it's just a way to let the shell send an EOF to the process stdin.\r\nThe problem here is that no new line is print after an EOF.\r\n\r\nThe same issue exists when the shell reads an EOF, it's not related to ctrl-d at all.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmcroce@t490s:~$ echo date |bash\r\nmer 8 dic 2021, 18:05:41, CET\r\nmcroce@t490s:~$ echo date |dash\r\nmer 8 dic 2021, 18:05:44, CET\r\nmcroce@t490s:~$ echo date |zsh\r\nmer 8 dic 2021, 18:05:47, CET\r\nmcroce@t490s:~$ echo date |pwsh\r\nPowerShell 7.2.0\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.\r\n\r\nhttps://aka.ms/powershell\r\nType 'help' to get help.\r\n\r\nPS /home/mcroce> date\r\nmer 8 dic 2021, 18:05:50, CET\r\nPS /home/mcroce> mcroce@t490s:~$\r\n```\r\n\r\nAbove you can see that every shell writes a new line when reaching the end of the stdin, but powershell doesn't and clobbers the prompt.\r\nNo ctrl-d involved at all this time, just regular end of stream reached.",
