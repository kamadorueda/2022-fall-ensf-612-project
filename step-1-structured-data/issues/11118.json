  "body": "Follow-up from #9997, where @SeeminglyScience notes:\r\n\r\n> Yeah, looks like a binder bug. There must be a difference in how it approaches converting single item arrays vs more populated arrays. That would explain why the third [test below] works, the binder would still be cached.\r\n\r\nNote that the `[System.Management.Automation.Internal.AutomationNull]::Value` singleton - created with no-output command `& {}` below - is of type `[psobject]`.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# This FAILS: multi-element array, one element of which is the AutomationNull singleton.\r\n$anull = & {}; [Type]::GetTypeArray(@(0, $anull)).Name | Should -Be 'Int32', 'PSObject'\r\n\r\n# This SUCCEEDS - single-element array, with just AutomationNull.\r\n$anull = & {}; [Type]::GetTypeArray(@(, $anull)).Name | Should -Be 'PSObject'\r\n\r\n# RETRYING the ORIGINAL command NOW SUDDENLY SUCCEEDS.\r\n$anull = & {}; [Type]::GetTypeArray(@(0, $anull)).Name | Should -Be 'Int32', 'PSObject'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests should succeed.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe first test fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\nOperationStopped: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs mentioned, after the 2nd test has run, the original tests suddenly starts working, due to the binder having been cached.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.5\r\n```\r\n",
