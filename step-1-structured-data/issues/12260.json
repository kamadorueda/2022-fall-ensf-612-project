      "body": "I did not want to edit the original issue, so I added a new comment to enhance.\r\n\r\n## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nAs the [current VpnClient module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/vpnclient/?view=windowsserver2019-ps) on Windows platform includes `Get`, `Set`, `New`, `Add` & `Remove` verbs, an `Invoke` verb seems like the missing piece.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nEstablishes a VPN connection using an existing VPN configuration.\r\n```\r\nInvoke-VpnConnection \r\n[-Name] <String>\r\n[-Credential] <System.Management.Automation.PSCredential>\r\n```\r\n### Description\r\nThe **Invoke-VpnConnection** command checks the VPN configuration by name and establishes a connection by a saved configuration. It can use the credentials or certificate defined in the configuration by default.  If a certificate or credential is not configured, the default is the current user.\r\n\r\nIf there is not a VPN configuration with the Name property, it throws an error:\r\n`VPN connection test was not found. : The system could not find the phone book entry for this connection.`\r\n\r\nIf the connection fails, It throws an error related to the exception: Incorrect Credentials, Network Connection Failure etc.\r\n\r\nIt requires the whole VpnClient module to be cross platform.\r\n\r\n### Parameters\r\n`-Name`\r\nSpecifies the name of this VPN connection profile.\r\n\r\n| Type:                                      | String |\r\n| :--- | :--- | \r\n| Position:                                 | 1                          |\r\n| Aliases:                                   | None                   |\r\n| Default value:                         | None                  |\r\n| Accept pipeline input:            | True                    |\r\n| Accept wildcard characters:   | False                   |\r\n\r\n`-Credential`\r\nOptional. Specifies a user account that have permission to perform this action. If a certificate or credential is not configured, the default is the current user.\r\n\r\n| Type:                                      | PSCredential |\r\n| :--- | :--- | \r\n| Position:                                 | Named                |\r\n| Aliases:                                   | None                   |\r\n| Default value:                         | None                  |\r\n| Accept pipeline input:            | False                   |\r\n| Accept wildcard characters:   | False                   |\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\n#### Example 1\r\n`Get-VpnConnection | Invoke-VpnConnection`\r\nGets the only VPN connection defined and establishes a connection using stored credentials. If credentials are not defined in the VPN Configuration, it falls back to current logged in user.\r\n\r\n#### Example 2\r\n`Invoke-VpnConnection -Name \"Fabrikam\" -Credential (Get-Credential)`\r\nEstablishes a new VPN connection by name overriding the saved credentials, if exists.\r\n\r\n### Inputs\r\n**None**\r\n\r\nThis cmdlet does not take any object as input.\r\n\r\n### Outputs\r\n**None**\r\n\r\nThis cmdlet does not generate any output.\r\n",
