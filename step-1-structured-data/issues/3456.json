I was curious how common this was, and it's not uncommon:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$verbs = (Get-Verb).Verb\r\nFind-Module | ? { $modName = $_.Name; $verbs | ? { $modName.StartsWith($_) } }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis gives my 97 modules, some of which sound more like scripts than modules, but it's hard to see without looking more closely.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, consider this just one opinion, nothing more.",
