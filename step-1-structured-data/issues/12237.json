Using the REG.EXE command from the shell inspects this value:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>  reg.exe query HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\\Personalize\r\n\r\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\\Personalize\r\n    ColorPrevalence    REG_DWORD    0x0\r\n    EnableTransparency    REG_DWORD    0x1\r\n    AppsUseLightTheme    REG_DWORD    0x0\r\n    SystemUsesLightTheme    REG_DWORD    0x1\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nPowerShell `Get-Property` retrieves the modified value as expected. *But* the actual value in the Registry remains unchanged, and the Windows system appearance does not change.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> Get-ItemProperty -name SystemUsesLightTheme    -Path  HKCU:\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\\Personalize\r\n\r\nSystemUsesLightTheme : 0\r\nPSPath               : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Softwar\r\n                       e\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\\Personalize\r\nPSParentPath         : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Softwar\r\n                       e\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\r\nPSChildName          : Personalize\r\nPSDrive              : HKCU\r\nPSProvider           : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry\r\n\r\n\r\n> reg.exe query HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\\Personalize\r\n\r\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Themes\\Personalize\r\n    ColorPrevalence    REG_DWORD    0x0\r\n    EnableTransparency    REG_DWORD    0x1\r\n    AppsUseLightTheme    REG_DWORD    0x1\r\n    SystemUsesLightTheme    REG_DWORD    0x1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0-preview.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0-preview.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
