  "body": "Conceptually related: #11689\r\n\r\nWhen you successfully invoke `Push-Location`, it is the _current_ location that is pushed onto the (unnamed or specified) stack, so that a subsequent `Pop-Location` call returns to that location.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly, this also happens when the attempt to change the location _fails_, e.g. due to being given a nonexistent path.\r\n\r\nThat is:\r\n\r\n* The current location then doesn't change (due to the failure), yet _the current location has been pushed onto the stack nonetheless_\r\n* Calling `Pop-Location` then effectively _remains_ in the current location (due to that same location having been pushed onto the stack, even though no location change occurred)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe behavior  is both surprising and inconvenient in interactive use.\r\n\r\nIt differs from how `bash` and `zsh` handle the situation, which do _not_ push the current location onto the stack if the target directory cannot be changed to.\r\n\r\nNote: Changing this behavior, though definitely desirable for _interactive_ behavior, I think, would technically a _breaking change_:\r\n\r\nConceivably, there is code out there that _relies_ on `Push-Location` _unconditionally_ pushing the current location and _blindly_ calls `Pop-Location` afterwards.\r\n\r\nIf the change is considered too risky, the surprising behavior should at least be documented.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$prev = $PWD; Set-Location $HOME; Push-Location temp:/\r\n# temp:/ is now current, with $HOME pushed onto the stack.\r\n\r\n# Make a failed attempt to push a different location.\r\nPush-Location /No/Such/Dir -ErrorAction Ignore \r\n\r\n# Given that Push-Location failed, it is reasonable to expect popping \r\n# to return to $HOME.\r\ntry {\r\n  (Pop-Location -PassThru).Path | Should -Be $HOME\r\n} finally {\r\n  $prev | Set-Location\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected strings to be the same, but they were different. \r\nExpected length: 15 Actual length:   6 Strings differ at index 0. \r\nExpected: '/Users/jdoe' But was:  'Temp:/'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-rc.2\r\n```\r\n",
