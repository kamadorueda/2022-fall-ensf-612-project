Our cmdlet [Set-AzKeyVaultSecret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/az.keyvault/set-azkeyvaultsecret?view=azps-4.3.0) relies on `*.format.ps1xml` to hide some sensitive properties, including the secret in plain text.\r\n\r\nHowever when excuting in a job, like in this issue Azure/azure-powershell/issues/12266 , the format rules somehow do not apply, and the secret text would appear.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSee Azure/azure-powershell/issues/12266\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFormat rules should apply no matter the cmdlet is run in or not in a job.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nFormat rules do not apply. Plain text secret displayed.\r\n\r\nSee Azure/azure-powershell/issues/12266\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.19041.1\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.19041.1\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```\r\nPowerShell core reproduces this issue too --\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

Objects received from there have to be deserialized, which will mean that any defined formats will not apply to the received objects; they're essentially re-created as PSCustomObject with an additional PSTypeName of `Deserialized.Original.Type.Name`\r\n\r\nWhile it's unfortunate in this particular case, I'm not sure this is necessarily avoidable. The best thing I can think to do here is to flag sensitive properties as hidden, perhaps using `System.Management.Automation.HiddenAttribute`? \ud83e\udd14 ",

      "body": "Good to know! I must be remembering something else, then, maybe an edge case where it wasn't working properly for whatever reason.\r\n\r\n@isra-fel after tinkering around a little it seems to me the most likely source of the issue is that the user doesn't have your module actually imported in the parent session, and it's only imported for the child job. As a result, the format information is missing from the parent session.\r\n\r\nThat's not something we can really do anything about necessarily, and is probably one of the reasons I'd really question why a _format_ file is being used to hide supposedly sensitive information? Custom formats are a UX and convenience feature, not a security feature. If the data is potentially sensitive, it should probably be hidden in a way that doesn't depend on a format file.",

If I import the module in advance and the problem would be gone.\r\n\r\nAgree with @vexx32 's point. We need to revisit our design.\r\n\r\nThanks again. This issue can be closed :)",
