However, the `-Configuration` parameter only allows users to refer to a configuration (.cscfg) file via a local filepath.\r\n\r\nDesired: The `-Configuration` parameter should allow for users to refer to a  configuration (.cscfg) file that's in blob storage via the blob's URL, in addition to a local file path.",
