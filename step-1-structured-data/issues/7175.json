This results in a less than pleasant reading experience. Here is what I'm seeing in 6.1 preview 3 on Windows:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177512/41734116-4145f77a-7543-11e8-8951-e91c008ecbd7.png)\r\n\r\nCompare this to the nicer formatted 5.1 help:\r\n\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177512/41734185-7348234c-7543-11e8-8575-7c041c354fed.png)\r\n\r\nThere is also a typo in the 6.1 Get-ChildItem Description - it says `all child continers` and it should be `all child containers`.  Apparently that has been introduced by the rendered as the typo isn't in the source doc.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-preview.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.1.0-preview.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nMoved from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2606 per request of @sdwheeler.",

I checked with 6.0.2 and it's the same issue when you pipe help to a pager, so it's not a regression from the formatting changes, but I think it's something in the HelpSystem.  It's in `future` since it's not blocking 6.1 release.  `future` is the new `backlog`.",
