  "body": "It would be great if there was an aka.ms shortcut for the current version of each of the MSI installers published. \r\n\r\nThat would make it much easier to deploy PS Core with tools like SCCM. A simple install script could be used to download the MSI and then run the installation with the advantage that you'd always be installing the current version. ",
