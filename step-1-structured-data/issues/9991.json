      "body": "@iSazonov this changes existing functionality indirectly by installing PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\nBasically, if you _don't_ have PS Core installed, entering `powershell` in the address bar in File Explorer actually invokes `powershell.exe` as it's on `%PATH%`.\r\n\r\nHowever, once you install PS Core, it creates the `%HOME%\\Documents\\PowerShell` folder. Attempting to invoke Windows PowerShell in the same way as before now defaults to opening this folder instead of invoking `powershell.exe`.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's anything we can really do to fix this, though. Literally any creation of a similarly-named folder in a similar location will similarly break most things that could potentially be invoked this way.\r\n\r\nIf anything, this should be raised via Windows channels to see if there's anything that can / should be done on that end.",
