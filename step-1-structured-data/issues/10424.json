However, if you use `+` append sign in front of the variable, it works.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nBelow you will see that I try to run the command without the `+` to set the `ErrorVariable`, which won't work. Later, it works with `+` with a different parameter. In the first case, outputting the `$errorVariable` does not display anything. \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/369188/63544666-ec711e00-c4e2-11e9-9fda-d3c42ec064b8.png)\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`ErrorVariable` should be working without the need of `+` append operator in front.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n`ErrorVariable` is not set when an error happens.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/369188/63544920-728d6480-c4e3-11e9-8304-743643080c42.png)\r\n\r\n",
