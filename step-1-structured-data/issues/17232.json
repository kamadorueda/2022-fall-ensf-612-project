It's likely due to the restriction from being a Store app.\r\nThe workaround is to use either the MSI version or the zip version of pwsh. For MSI installation, you can setup in the installer to use Windows Update to upgrade pwsh, so it will be similar to the Store version from the upgrade perspective, but with no restriction.",

      "body": "> EDIT: This seems to happen a lot with apps from the Microsoft Store - Why are things so inconsistent?\r\n\r\nThis is because Windows Store apps are tightly sandboxed, which doesn't work well for PowerShell given the shell needs to touch things that may be restricted from store apps.\r\n\r\n> All Windows Store apps are tightly sandboxed. This means Windows Store apps run in their own virtual space (the sandbox) and whatever happens to it does not affect any other app running or the OS itself.",
