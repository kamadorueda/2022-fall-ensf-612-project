  "body": "Hi all!\r\n\r\nLinking a particular bullet back to the context - a pull request, issue, etc. - could be quite valuable.  It might take a bit more effort, but you might consider including this information.\r\n\r\nFor example, check the [kubernetes changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#other-notable-changes-2) - this makes it easy for me to go right to discussion / implementation details for a change I'm curious about (Thanks for the example Trevor!)\r\n\r\nCheers!",

For example, was curious about PSRP in the recent release, had to dig through a few issues before finding #942, which had exactly what I was looking for via @paulcallen\r\n\r\nPersonally I would love to see each bullet linked to a PR or group of PRs, and each PR would always link to related issues, but, I know it might not be a priority.\r\n\r\nCheers!",
