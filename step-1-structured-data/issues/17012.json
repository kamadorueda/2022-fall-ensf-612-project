  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn Windows, run the following script in PowerShell 7.2.1:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInstall-Module -Name IISAdministration\r\nImport-Module IISAdministration\r\nGet-Module -ListAvailable\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have confirmed on a VM running 19042 that the Windows 10 build is not a factor as far as I can tell, because on a 20H2 VM I still see the problem behavior. I have also enabled IIS Management Console and IIS Management Scripts and Tools. The bulk of the documentation I could find referred to earlier versions of PowerShell 7 not supporting IISAdministration, but this doesn't seem to apply to 7.2.1 - if it did globally, I wouldn't have myself and multiple other team members running the scripts with no issues. I appreciate any help!\r\n\r\nI did see in issue #13818 the reporter was told to look in the https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShellModuleCoverage repo and I reported the issue there as well, but then I saw the repo appears to be defunct. Its last commit was literally 4 years ago. ALl the other issues I can find reported for IISAdministration and PowerShell Core / 7 are at least two years old and refer specifically to earlier versions of PowerShell being incompatible, but I can see from the fact that the module works on several developer machines in my department that is no longer true.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe import should succeed and the module should be listed:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nScript     1.1.0.0               IISAdministration                   Core,Desk {Get-IISServerManager, Set-IISConfigAtt\u2026\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe import fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nImport-Module: Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Web.Administration, Version=7.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364e35'.\r\n\r\nThe system cannot find the file specified.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Get-Module list shows no cmdlets associated with IISAdministration:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nScript     1.1.0.0               IISAdministration                   Core,Desk\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\nOn the machine exhibiting the problem behavior:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\thoma> $PSVersiontable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the machine working successfully:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\Users\\thomas.parikkaADM> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

      "body": "If I install the module using `Install-Module -Name IISAdministration -Scope AllUsers -AllowClobber` it installs to C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules and from that directory the module seems to function. If there are any copies of the module living in the user's C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\PowerShell\\Modules folder or in C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\Modules, the module fails to access the Microsoft.Web.Administration.dll module available in C:\\Windows\\system32\\inetsrv. I'm not clear on why, and I'm still testing it out on some dev machines. Would appreciate any feedback from folks here as to why that might be.",
