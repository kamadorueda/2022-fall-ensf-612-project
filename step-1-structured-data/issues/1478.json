If only files in the ignore list were touched, then the build passes almost immediately.\n\nThis needs to be tested more thoroughly, and the list of files reviewed. But it's a start.\n\nThanks for the idea @lzybkr.\n",

      "body": "I give. Sadly there are too many bugs around Travis CI's very important variable, `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE`, thus it does not seem possible to safely determine what files changed in a push or a PR. The variable [is useless](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2668#issuecomment-52210454), and it's what would be required to implement this kind of behavior.\n\nThis seemed like a simple thing to do. But it turns out that Travis relies on GitHub's API to determine the commit range, which causes it to be set to some very odd values. a) it does not necessarily get set for a push (without a PR), b) it does not get set if [only one commit](%28https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/5133#issuecomment-230889941%29) is pushed, c) it does not get reset if the PR is updated, d) it does not get reset if the branch is rebased. [Others have found](https://github.com/TechEmpower/FrameworkBenchmarks/blob/master/toolset/run-ci.py#L45) that there are unfortunately at least 8 different edge cases for `TRAVIS_COMMIT_RANGE`.\n",
