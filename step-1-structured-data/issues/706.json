      "body": "Long discussion about case sensitivity in general by @PowerShell/powershell-committee today. \r\n\r\nSome starting principles:\r\n* C# (and by extension, .NET) is fully case sensitive (types, variables, methods, etc.)\r\n* *Internally*, PowerShell is case-insensitive (PS variables, functions, cmdlets)\r\n  - There are exceptions (`#region` or comment-based help, for instance), but for the sake of this disucssion, I think that's irrelevant.\r\n* For most cases, filesystems are case-sensisitive (even on Windows, it's tricky, but NTFS can have two files with the same case).\r\n* On non-Windows platforms, environment variables are case-sensitive. PowerShell already respects the platform behavior here.\r\n* Tab completion is interactive where we allow all kinds of things that aren't possible with scripted behavior (which has to be deterministic)\r\n\r\nAs I linked above, there's 4 different cases that have to be solved for (I'm going to use \"Namespace\" as the stand-in term for all the things being discussed in this thread)\r\n1. One option which is an exact match\r\n    * Namespace: Apple; Input: Apple\r\n1. One match which doesn't match the given case\r\n    - Namespace: Apple; Input: apple\r\n1. Multiple matches where one matches the given case\r\n    - Namespaces: Apple, apple; Input: Apple\r\n1. Multiple matches where none match the given case\r\n    - Namespaces: Apple, apple; Input: aPPLE\r\n\r\nEveryone in the room agreed that 1 and 3 should always match the exact match. From there, we agreed that 2 and 4 shouldn't \"do something random\" by calling the incorrect match. \r\n\r\nHowever, we also agreed that tab-completing in a case-insensitive way is highly desirable so as to correct typing errors. We already do this for .NET namepsaces (e.g. `[environme<tab>` completes to `[System.Environment]`). (It should probably go without saying, but this would be implemented as a PSReadline feature and should be exposed as a configurable option.)\r\n\r\nBug to file that could make this all annoying: `Move-Item` and `Rename-Item `can't change a file's case in place",
