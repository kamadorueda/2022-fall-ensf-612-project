  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInstall v7-preview5 from private preview in MS store (important, does not repro with MSI installation)\r\nCall the [install-powershell.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/tools/install-powershell.ps1) with the `-Daily` switch from PowerShell being installed via MSIX.\r\ncc @SteveL-MSFT \r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt works, just the same way it works for any version like e.g. the v7-preview5 from MSI\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe installed daily build of PowerShell gets corrupt (this has happened 2 times in a row and is therefore not a sporadic problem).\r\n`Test-Path` on the `powershell-daily` folder of the daily install reports `true` and `get-childitem` can see items but the using the `pwsh.exe` from inside it does not work (immediate crash with no stack trace). Somehow the `powershell-daily` folder is not visible/accessible via explorer.exe. Running Test-Path from a different (non MSIX) PowerShell returns `false`, therefore it seems to be a problem with folder permissions.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nv7-preview5 from MS Store private preview\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-Preview.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-Preview.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "Ok, it seems that there is still some filesystem virtualization happening with AppX even though the package requests `unvirtualizedResources`.  When I run `install-powershell.ps1 -daily` in the MSIX pwsh, it ran but also had issues with the newly installed pwsh at the end of the script.  I can see the folder and its contents.  If I use a regular pwsh window, that folder doesn't exist at all.  If I close and start a new MSIX pwsh, that folder doesn't exist anymore.",

      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT Just FYI that this issue is still present with version `7.1.0-preview.6` from the MS-Store.\r\n\r\nRelated to the MS-Store generally: Apparently it forcibly closes the process of the running app during update (which cannot be controlled either), which could be fatal in some cases where a script is mid execution and could leave a system in a corrupt state. Therefore, personally I will not consider using the Microsoft store any more due to that and I think the store description should have a warning about this risk because most people will not be aware. Please evaluate whether the MS-Store is actually suitable for RTM releases of PowerShell or only previews only due to that.",
