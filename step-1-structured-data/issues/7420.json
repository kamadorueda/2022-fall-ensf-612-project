  "body": "`LanguagePrimitives.TryConvertTo`  is implemented by wrapping `LanguagePrimitives.ConvertTo` in exception handling, and return false if it failed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis can be improved upon by using the `ConversionData` return from `FigureConversion` by checking if the `Rank` is `ConversionRank.None` before we try to call the conversion. \r\n\r\nBy doing an early exit, return we avoid the exceptions that are always thrown when there are no available conversions.\r\n\r\n",
