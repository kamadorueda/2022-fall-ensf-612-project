  "body": "I have successfully parsed and applied DSC configurations in PS Core on Windows 10 and Server 2016. However, I receive errors on 2012R2 when parsing the DSC `configuration`. The error is basically coming from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/DscSupport/CimDSCParser.cs#L683 because `BaseRegistration\\\\MSFT_MetaConfigurationExtensionClasses.Schema.mof` does not exist. If I update the server to WMF5, the parsing works.\r\n\r\nIs it expected that DSC configuration parsing work on WMF 4?",
