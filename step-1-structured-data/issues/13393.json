  "body": "PR https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13361 missed one aspect of what is was trying to fix, namely what was originally reported  in #10512:\r\n\r\nHow `$?` is set in an external-program call should solely depend on the process exit code, irrespective of whether there is stderr output and _whether or not stderr output is redirected_.\r\n\r\nIt is the latter that's still a problem, which matters primarily with respect to `&&` and `||`:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# On Unix\r\nPS> sh -c 'ls nosuch; :' 2>$null || 'why did I get here?'\r\nwhy did I get here?\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# On Unix\r\nsh -c 'ls nosuch; :' 2>$null; $? | Should -BeTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed: \r\n\r\nSince the _exit code_ of the `sh` command is `0`, `$?` should be `$true` - irrespective of the presence of stderr output, _whether redirected or not_.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, because the presence of _redirected_ stderr output unexpectedly set `$?` to `$false\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected $true, but got $false.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.5\r\n```\r\n",
