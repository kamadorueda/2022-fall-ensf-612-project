  "body": "Using the latest 6.1.0 release, the name of the installed package, the window name and the context menu only include the major version but not  the minor version, which will make it hard to distinguish the side-by-side versions. I believe this must be a regression that happened in the refactoring to make the preview packages of 6.1. cc @SteveL-MSFT  @joeyaiello \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9250262/45544436-38194300-b80f-11e8-9327-23021f8a8881.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9250262/45544475-52532100-b80f-11e8-8ba0-c9f182485a16.png)\r\n",

The specification section says stable versions go under ...\\PowerShell\\6 and preview versions go under ..\\PowerShell\\6-Preview.  The alternate considerations calls out 6.0 vs 6.1 folders, but the decision was to just use the major version for the MSI install as customers must move forward 6 months after next stable release anyways.\r\n\r\nThe text in the menu reflects this.  Most customers should not be concerned if they are on 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, etc...\r\n\r\ncc @joeyaiello ",
