      "body": "Traceroutes on Linux are very much not super functional I'm afraid. We're relying on .net core's ping API for that, and we don't get much information from it on Unix OSes.\r\n\r\nI think #10697 is my PR which should help _some_ but it's still not great. We're trying to get .net core to improve the API functionality, but I've not heard a great deal from them as yet.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/28934\r\n\r\nLoose like they're content to wait till .net 5 which is a bit disappointing. Perhaps adding your voice there will give them a bit of a reason to prioritise it, but they don't seem especially keen to get it sorted out.\r\n\r\nCc @iSazonov @SteveL-MSFT ",
