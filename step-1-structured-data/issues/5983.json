      "body": "I see this issue happen on PS 6.0.3 on both Ubuntu 18.04 and on Windows 10.   Also, Windows PowerShell 5.1 has the same issue.  I will also note it does not happen to BASH, BASH behaves really well when its window is resized, both vertically and horizontally.  PS, not so much.  Its worse (more noticed) in VS Code integrated console, as its more likely to have the window resized throughout a development/test cycle.\r\n\r\nEDIT:  Need to clarify that on Windows these kinds of effects may not occur until the console buffer is full, and more often causes the some of the past scroll buffer data to blank out, specifically when the window size is increased.   I have to admit, that its much more rare in Windows consoles than it originally seemed.  Might be related to issue #3532.",
