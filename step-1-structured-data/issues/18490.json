Maybe an exception could be made when calling `Write-Error` by itself on the command line but what's the use case for that?",

      "body": "Hi, @SteveL-MSFT, @MartinGC94 and @kilasuit! Thanks for your replies.\r\n\r\nSo while debug, verbose, and warning messages are prefixed with a string indicating their message type (\"DEBUG: \", \"VERBOSE: \", \"WARNING: \"), error messages aren't... What is the recommended way to achieve a consistent output for all message types? Should I suppress `Write-Error`'s output by adding `-ErrorAction SilentlyContinue` and then display the error message with `Write-Host -Message \"ERROR: $errorMessage\" -ForegroundColor Red`? Or is it -the other way around- possible to  let `Write-Debug`, `Write-Verbose`, and `Write-Warning` prefix their output with the source like `Write-Error` does?",
