It's very easy to use. In fact, it's a WPF program, utilizing all the [`Visual`](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.windows.media.visual) power of WPF.\r\n\r\nUsually, I'm adding an animation to the beginning and end of the screencast (the yellow arrow in the screenshot) turning down opacity of the clip at either end.",

      "body": "Hmm the `git` command is definitely the executable and not some custom function that might be messing with the Runspace stack so I'm unsure as to why `exit`/`$host.SetShouldExit` is not doing anything. If you use a tool like process explorer do you find powershell is being run in another shell and/or that `exit` closes at least one process when run?",
