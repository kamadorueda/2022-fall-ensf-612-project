      "body": "`cp` on Windows is an alias for Copy-Item which is why `-Force` works. On non-Windows hosts it's calling the native binary `cp` at `/bin/cp` which isn't related to PowerShell. If you want something that works on both Windows and other platforms don't use `cp` and instead use `Copy-Item` so you are calling the PowerShell cmdlet directly.",

Even then you can't guarantee that `cp` will always accept `-f`.\r\n\r\n> Can't powershell be considered a wrapper for native commands?\r\n\r\nDepends on how you define a wrapper. PowerShell is a shell which can be used to call native commands. It's not always wrapping those commands, i.e. `Copy-Item` does not call `cp` internally but uses a bunch of syscalls through .NET.\r\n\r\nSo if you want something that is platform agnostic, use the PowerShell cmdlets (`Copy-Item`) to copy the file.",
