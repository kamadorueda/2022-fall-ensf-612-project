  "body": "When used inside a module function `$ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.ExpandString` only works for global variables. However using `$PSCmdLet.GetVariableValue` also works for Script Scope variables. I think they both should work the same way, or there should be some other way to make a module function inherit the execution context of the caller.\r\nThe issue came up when I tried to wrap `ExpandString` and `[System.Environment]::ExpandEnvironmentVariables` in a neat Cmdlet inside our inhouse helper module. Spent the last 5 hours trying to figure out a way to make it work, found some solutions but all are sort of ugly.\r\nI thought of two approaches to cleanly solve this issue:\r\n- a new option for `CmdletBinding`, like `[CmdletBinding(InheritExecutionContext)]`\r\n- some way to pass the `$ExecutionContext`, or the `$Executioncontext.InvokeCommand` property to a function/cmdlet.\r\n\r\nI know that dotsourcing the script works, but that is not what I would like, since it can't be in a module then.\r\nWhat also kind of works is to add the script to the `ScriptsToProcess` section in the modules *.psd1* file, but that's also not very tidy, since it prevents the user from using `Remove-Module` to fully remove the module. The script will remain as an extra module.\r\n\r\nA simple sample to demonstrate:\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nCreate a new Module, *ExpandStringIssue* and add a file *ExpandStringIssue.psm1* with the following content: \r\n```\r\nfunction ExpandStringIssue {\r\n[CmdletBinding()]\r\nParam( \r\n   [Parameter(Mandatory=$True,ValueFromRemainingArguments=$True,ValueFromPipeline=$True)]$Value\r\n)\r\nPROCESS {\r\n    [System.Environment]::ExpandEnvironmentVariables( $ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.ExpandString( $Value ) )\r\n    $PSCmdlet.GetVariableValue( $Value.Trim( '$' ) )\r\n}\r\n}\r\n```\r\nCreate a script file named *ShowExpandStringIssue.ps1* with the following content\r\n```\r\nimport-module ExpandStringIssue\r\n\r\nNew-Variable -Scope Script -Name MyVar -Value 'MyVarValue'\r\n\r\n$StringToExpand = '$MyVar'\r\nWrite-Host \"ExpandStringIssue returns:\"\r\nExpandStringIssue -Value $StringToExpand\r\nWrite-Host \"-\"\r\nWrite-Host \"ExpandString returns:\"\r\n$ExecutionContext.InvokeCommand.ExpandString( $StringToExpand )\r\nWrite-Host \"-\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen invoked, the module ExpandStringIssue function returns an empty line for the $MyVar expansion, and a line containing the actual value of $MyVar to demonstrate that the module actually is able to query $MyVar, just not through ExpandString.\r\nThe bottom ExpandString output was just added to show the actual output of ExpandString.\r\n",

      "body": "@mklement0 I saw that issue too, I guess it's related but I think there should be some general way to make the parent context available to a module function. So I thought it best to open a new issue, instead of somewhat hijacking that issue :)\r\nRegarding the `$PSCmdlet.SessionState.InvokeCommand.ExpandString()`, I tried that too, during my research on the matter, among many other things. From what I found the InvokeCommand reference is actually the same in the caller and in the module function. By glancing at the Powershell source it seems that calling a function adds another scope to the ExecutionContext, and that causes the variables to be \"hidden\", so there's no way to get around that without changing the function invocation code in the Powershell source. As a side note, I even tried to get to the parent's scope trough calling `Callstackframe.GetFrameVariables` for the parent stack frame obtained using `Get-PSCallstack` but that also didn't work.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I also thought a little about the implications a change to the context availability would have on module functions, and I definitely think the module function needs to **request** the parent context in some way, so the module programmer can make sure the function is aware of the security issues that might arise (like function overwrites, aliases or variables with malicious content, etc.).",
