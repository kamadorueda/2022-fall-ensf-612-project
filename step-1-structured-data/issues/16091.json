  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI recently saw a user who wanted to await user input but also intermittently perform a background task. The current solution for this is something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nwhile ($true)\r\n{\r\n    Do-Something\r\n\r\n    if ($Host.UI.RawUI.KeyAvailable)\r\n    {\r\n        break\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut it struck me that we would ideally be able to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$event = Register-EngineEvent -SourceIdentifier PowerShell.OnIdle -Action { Do-Something }\r\nRead-Host\r\nUnregister-Event -SubscriptionId $event.ID\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this essentially works with the PSReadLine prompt, it doesn't work with `Read-Host` (engine idle events aren't processed while waiting on `Read-Host`). Adding idle event processing on `Read-Host` might be a nice enhancement in PowerShell.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
