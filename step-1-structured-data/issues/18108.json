      "body": "`Get-FileHash` id binary cmdlet in pwsh and script in Windows PowerShell. This says WinPS doesn't load Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility module in right way.\r\n\r\nRoot of the issue both PowerShell modify PSModule environment variable to insert version specific paths. \r\n\r\nObviously, this leads to conflict. While pwsh uses tricks to fix this WinPS knows nothing about it and works the same old way. Also pwsh cannot apply its tricks if it do not call WinPS directly.\r\nThere have already been a few PRs made around this. Each time with different tricky bugs. There will probably be more attempts until a move is made to eliminate the conflict at the root.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion was to abandon this practice (modify PSModule), but MSFT team says it will break some scenarios, but doesn't say which ones - apparently it's their big secret :-)",
