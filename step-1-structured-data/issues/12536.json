  "body": "I have opened #12521 which is about PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1.  But [it sounds like this might not be the right repo for that issue.](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12521#issuecomment-621898067)  PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1 is, however, distributed with each release of PowerShell; a copy appears in each installation folder on this computer and it appears in the .zip release artifacts.  \r\n\r\nBut I don't see PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1 in this repo.  [It was suggested that](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12521#issuecomment-621898067) #12521 \r\n should be transferred to PowerShell/PSDscResources but PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1 appears neither in that repo nor the releases produced from it.  PowerShell/PSDscResources#185 is about the PSDesiredStateConfiguration module.  It was opened 28 days ago and has had no activity since.  This all suggests that PowerShell/PSDscResources isn't the right place for #12521.\r\n\r\n[A github search for the file's header contents](https://github.com/search?p=1&q=%22%27PSDesiredStateConfiguration%27+logic+module%22&type=Code) produces no obvious authoritative instance of PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1.  [A google search](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEV_enCA885CA885&ei=lf2qXvnOAYfT-gTa8qrQAw&q=%22%27PSDesiredStateConfiguration%27+logic+module%22&oq=%22%27PSDesiredStateConfiguration%27+logic+module%22&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQA1AAWABgygpoAHAAeACAAUeIAYQBkgEBMpgBAKoBB2d3cy13aXo&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwi57ezeyZDpAhWHqZ4KHVq5CjoQ4dUDCAw&uact=5) produces even fewer results.\r\n\r\nIt looks like [the fate of PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1 was contemplated in 2017](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2172#issuecomment-285216683).  Per @SteveL-MSFT:\r\n\r\n>@PowerShell/powershell-committee reviewed this and the work item is to decouple DSC from PSCore eventually\".  \r\n\r\nBut then #2902 was fixed for PowerShell 7.  These messages feel rather mixed to me and I'm not sure how I should interpret them.  \r\n\r\nThis all leaves me without an obvious home for #12521 and with the following questions:\r\n\r\n1. From where does the instance of PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1 included in PowerShell releases originate?\r\n2. Where is that instance maintained?\r\n",
