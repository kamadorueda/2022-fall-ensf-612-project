      "body": "I looked at some of the changes and my primary concern is that adding a period to the end of a <summary/> comment doesn't make it a sentence.  Many of the existing comments are just clauses and not complete sentences and adding the period addresses the CodeFactor rule, but makes the comment worse.  If we want to address those, we should have better comments that are complete sentences.",

So we can just remove the noisy CodeFactor issues formally.\r\n\r\nLet's do a formal review - we can't replace tons of formal comments with meaningful ones.",

It seems that we would eventually want good comments so that we can generate SDK docs from the code, but that is a non-trivial task to review all the comments and make them useful and complete sentences.  Perhaps we should defer that as a separate issue.",
