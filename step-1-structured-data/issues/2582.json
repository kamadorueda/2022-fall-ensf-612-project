  "body": "This could be the expected behavior, but if it is, it doesn't really make sense to me, so if someone could clarify, I'd really appreciate it. \r\n\r\nBasically, I'm trying to make sure that scripts signed with my company's code signing certificate are trusted on remote systems that have their execution policy set to AllSigned. From what I've seen in my tests and looking at the code, PowerShell ultimately requires that the certificate be included in the Trusted Publishers store. Below is the code that seems to confirm it:\r\n\r\n        // Checks that a publisher is trusted by the system or is one of\r\n        // the signed product binaries\r\n        private bool IsTrustedPublisher(Signature signature, string file)\r\n        {\r\n            // Get the thumbprint of the current signature\r\n            X509Certificate2 signerCertificate = signature.SignerCertificate;\r\n            string thumbprint = signerCertificate.Thumbprint;\r\n\r\n            // See if it matches any in the list of trusted publishers\r\n            X509Store trustedPublishers = new X509Store(StoreName.TrustedPublisher, StoreLocation.CurrentUser);\r\n            trustedPublishers.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly);\r\n\r\n            foreach (X509Certificate2 trustedCertificate in trustedPublishers.Certificates)\r\n            {\r\n                if (String.Equals(trustedCertificate.Thumbprint, thumbprint, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))\r\n                    if (!IsUntrustedPublisher(signature, file)) return true;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            return false;\r\n        }\r\n\r\nIs this the expected behavior? If so, then why shouldn't it check other certificates in the chain? What would be the purpose of purchasing a certificate if I would have to import the certificate on the target machines anyway? ",
