You can find the dependencies in the PR description of #4902. Or better, look at the source of truth in `New-UnixPackage` from [packaging.psm1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/tools/packaging/packaging.psm1#L450).\r\n\r\nThe RPM package of `dotnet-runtime-2.0.0` depends on `openssl-libs` and thus cannot be installed through `yum install` on Amazon Linux.\r\nHowever, the dotnet team provide a [`.tar.gz` package](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.0-download.md) of `dotnet-runtime-2.0.0` for users to deploy (see https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/930), similar to the `.zip` package for windows. I think powershell should also provide a `.tar.gz` package for users to deploy powershell core on not officially supported distros. I will add this task to #3961.",
