  "body": "- [x] Resolves #954\n- [ ] Still need tests\n- [ ] Need to update known issues\n- [x] Need to fix globbing to have unix semantics:\n  - [x] expand hidden (.dotfile) directories\n  - [x] return relative (not absolute) paths\n- [ ] Need to file issue about escape characters\n\nEnable path globbing for native commands.\n\nE.g. `ls *.md` expands to `ls /path/to/README.md /path/to/CHANGELOG.md`\n\nIf expansion fails, the argument is sent literally, so `ls foo*` results in `/usr/bin/ls: cannot access foo*: No such file or directory`.\n\nDon't glob expand if the verbatim marker was used. So `ls --% *` fails with `/bin/ls: cannot access '*': No such file or directory`\n\nSame caveats as #1639; but the code is enabled only on *nix platforms, and the failing test is fixed.\n",

      "body": "Jeffery's great. The problem with `ls .git*` and other `.dotfiles` is that the globbing semantics by default ignore hidden directories. This isn't a problem with `Get-ChildItem` because it can be passed `-Hidden`; but for globbing on *nix, I'll add a set of semantics to the globber to include hidden files (and return relative instead of absolute paths).\n",
