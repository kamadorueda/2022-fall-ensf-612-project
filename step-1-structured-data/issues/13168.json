In v5, I was able to use extended-length paths (as detailed in https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file) to access files and folders with a path longer than the maximum length. I could access them locally via `\\\\?\\DRIVE:\\LONG\\PATH` and remotely via `\\\\?\\UNC\\SERVER-NAME\\SHARE\\LONG\\PATH`. These no longer work, which has broken nearly every single script I have.\r\n\r\n`$PSVersionTable.PSCompatibleVersions` says v7.0.2 should be compatible with 5.1.10032 upwards, but it is not.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem \\\\?\\C:\\Users\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nAs seen in PSVersion 5.1.17763.1007\r\n```none\r\n\r\n    Directory: \\\\?\\C:\r\n\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd-r---       2019-05-13     01:47                Users\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nReturns nothing - no error, no objects\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "PowerShell Core now supports long paths _by default_ - no  opt-in via `\\\\?\\` needed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, however, using the opt-in in PS Core (which should be a no-op) doesn't work consistently, which is problematic for cross-edition code that must also support Windows PowerShell - see #10805\r\n\r\nThe workaround in this particular case is to use `-LiteralPath` rather than the (implied) `-Path`.\r\n",
