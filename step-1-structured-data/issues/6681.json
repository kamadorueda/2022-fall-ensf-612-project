  "body": "<sup>Related: #6680</sup>\r\n\r\nOne use case for `Export-FormatData` - even though [`about_Format.ps1xml` doesn't currently mention it](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/issues/2341) - is to use existing formatting definitions as a starting point for creating new ones.\r\n\r\nTo that end, outputting _pretty-printed_ XML would be much more convenient - currently, a single-line XML string is output.\r\n\r\n* If changing the existing behavior is not a backward-compatibility concern:\r\n\r\n  * Simply output pretty-printed XML by default (it will consume more space, however)\r\n\r\n* Otherwise:\r\n  \r\n  * Introduce a switch such as `-Format` (or, to follow the  - inverted - logic of `ConvertTo-Json`, perhaps `-Uncompress`?) that results in pretty-printed output.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWritten as of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2\r\n```\r\n",
