When I check out the class on MS Docs, it seems like it's available in all the different .NET versions (CORE, Framework, 5.0 are the ones I checked).  Any idea why this property is not there with PowerShell 7?\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

I'll still ask - is this different on purpose, or is this still a valid issue?  It feels like a breaking change between 5.1 and 7, which I am not sure is a concern for the developers or not.  I can add logic to test either way based on the PSVersionTable I suppose, though that does stink a little.",

      "body": "Last thing I can think to say - while I have PowerShell 7 installed, I can't install PowerShell 6.  I'd like to know if PowerShell 6 has these properties the same way as 7, or as 5.1, so that I can build logic into my module to test for the provider based on the PSVersionTable.  I'll find a box to install it on, but just as a general question, I'm wondering if I should suspect 6 to be like 7, or like 5.1 as a rule of thumb?  Or should I simply never try to accommodate both PSEditions Core/Desktop with the same pieces of code (which I'd like to do).",
