Actually it shouldn't give errors even with functions, that returns something, because it's programmer business to take care about returning objects.\n\nActual behavior\n\nSecond call returns errors, Visual Studio 2015 Community edition, with update 3:\n\n```\nMissing clossing '}' in statement block or type definition.\nMissing a property name or method definition.\nAn expression was expected after '('.\nUnexpected token '}' in expression or statement.\n```\n\nPS output:\n\n```\n[ERROR] At C:\\Users\\Ja\\Documents\\Visual Studio \n[ERROR] 2015\\Projects\\pstests\\pstests\\pstests\\Script.ps1:6 char:15\n[ERROR] +     [StaticClass]::staticFunction()        #error 'Missing clossing ' ...\n[ERROR] +                  ~\n[ERROR] Missing a property name or method definition.\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] At C:\\Users\\Ja\\Documents\\Visual Studio \n[ERROR] 2015\\Projects\\pstests\\pstests\\pstests\\Script.ps1:6 char:2\n[ERROR] +     [StaticClass]::staticFunction()        #error 'Missing clossing ' ...\n[ERROR] +     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n[ERROR] Missing closing '}' in statement block or type definition.\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] At C:\\Users\\Ja\\Documents\\Visual Studio \n[ERROR] 2015\\Projects\\pstests\\pstests\\pstests\\Script.ps1:6 char:32\n[ERROR] +     [StaticClass]::staticFunction()        #error 'Missing clossing ' ...\n[ERROR] +                                   ~\n[ERROR] An expression was expected after '('.\n[ERROR] \n[ERROR] At C:\\Users\\Ja\\Documents\\Visual Studio \n[ERROR] 2015\\Projects\\pstests\\pstests\\pstests\\Script.ps1:7 char:1\n[ERROR] + }\n[ERROR] + ~\n[ERROR] Unexpected token '}' in expression or statement.\n[ERROR]     + CategoryInfo          : ParserError: (:) [], ParseException\n[ERROR]     + FullyQualifiedErrorId : IncompleteMemberDefinition\n```\n## Environment data\n\n```\nPSVersion                      5.1.14393.82                                    \nPSEdition                      Desktop                                         \nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                         \nBuildVersion                   10.0.14393.82                                   \nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000                                 \nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                             \nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                             \nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                         \n\n```\n",

      "body": "@PatrykMilewski Thanks for taking the time to write up an issue report but I _think_ this is working correctly. \n\nThis statement works:\n    $var = [StaticClass]::staticFunction() # first\nBecause what you are doing is defining a property whose name is \"var\" on the class [StaticClass] whose value is the result of the call.  You can see that by commenting out the next line and do this:\nPS> [StaticClass]::New() |fl *\nvar : \n\nThis line fails:\n   [StaticClass]::staticFunction()        # second\nbecause it is not defining anything in the class.  That is what this error is all about:\n    Missing a property name or method definition.\nBecause you are defining a class - you are limited to defining properties and methods and cannot run arbitrary code.\nIf you replace that line with \"Get-Process\", you will also get an error.\n\nDoes that make sense?\nWhat would have been a better error message/experience?\nAgain - thanks!\n",
