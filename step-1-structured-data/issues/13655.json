Generally speaking though I'd be surprised if that refers to SSLv3, which hasn't been in common use in quite a long time. My guess would be it has something to do with the version of the hashing algorithms used to generate the keys.",

The Certificate just contains encryption and hashing information to facilitate the functions of TLS. The version is just the version of the X509 structure, V3 doesn't mean SSL v3. The version tells the reader of the cert what fields can be contained and how it is structured.\r\n\r\nDetails of X509 version 3 can be found in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). It is the latest version available so `New-SelfSignedCertificate` isn't producing anything old.",
