  "body": "Something that might be useful for people using software containers, such as Docker / OCI or rkt, would be to include some debugging information to `$PSVersionTable`, to determine whether or not the PowerShell instance is running inside a software container. This may aid in debugging by providing additional, contextual information about the PowerShell process.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n**Trevor Sullivan**\r\nDocker Captain\r\nMicrosoft MVP: Cloud & Data Center Management\r\nhttps://trevorsullivan.net\r\nhttps://twitter.com/pcgeek86",
