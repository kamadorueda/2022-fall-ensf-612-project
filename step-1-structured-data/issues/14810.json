  "body": "Note:\r\n\r\n* Changing this behavior, which goes back to Windows PowerShell, would technically be a breaking change; the question is whether it falls into [bucket 3: Unlikely Grey Area](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area)\r\n\r\n* If a change isn't possible, the behavior should be documented (which should happen for _older_ versions either way).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhen PowerShell breaks multiline text into a stream / array of individual lines with `Get-Content`, it considers a terminal trailing newline an _optional terminator_; that is, if the _last_ line has a trailing newline, _no_ additional line is reported.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, `Get-Clipboard` _does_ report an extra, empty line, which, however, is consistent with what manual splitting with `-split '\\r?\\n` would return.\r\n\r\nAligning `Get-Clipboard`'s behavior with that of `Get-Content` makes more sense to me, however, given that:\r\n\r\n* Text copied from Excel has such trailing newlines, which you wouldn't want to reported with an extra empty string.\r\n\r\n* Having manually selected and copied lines in a text file may situationally include or not include a trailing newline, and it is unlikely that the user intended the difference to be meaningful.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn macOS (but the behavior applies to all platforms; use `xclip -selection clipboard` instead of `pbcopy` on Linux):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nsh -c 'printf ''line 1\\nline 2\\n'' | pbcopy'; Get-Clipboard | Should -Be 'line 1', 'line 2'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, because an extra, empty string is output:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected @('line 1', 'line 2'), but got @('line 1', 'line 2', <empty>)\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.3\r\n```\r\n",
