I would be surprised if that's necessary anywhere near as much as folx need to go looking for the file. Time lost finding the file as it is now v.s. time lost finding the file as it was before the rename weighted depending on frequency of need.\r\n\r\nI would argue that having a consistent naming convention will make maintenance easier both for the PS team and folx in the community, especially folx just starting to look at contributing. In my opinion the consistency is valuable here, but y'all may have different ideas. \ud83d\ude42 ",
