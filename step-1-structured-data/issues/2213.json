  "body": "This is a fix for issue #1531 (Linux -> Windows remote debugging does not work).\n\nTrying to remote debug a script from a Linux client would result in a hang.  The hang was in the PSReadLine GetPrompt() method because it tried to run the \"prompt\" function in a remote session that was stopped in the debugger, with the result that the \"prompt\" command was queued on the remote session for when the debugger stop is released.\n\nCommands should always be run through the Debugger API when a runspace is in debug stop mode.  The fix is to provide a new public helper method that invokes a command correctly on a runspace depending on its current state, and update PSReadLine to use the new helper method.  The new method is intended to help other console host implementations that need to run commands on a its runspace for user display.\n",
