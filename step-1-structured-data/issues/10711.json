  "body": "I am currently using Windows version 1903. \r\nAfter installing the Windows PowerShell v6+, the new PowerShell console window does not support Control-V paste after entering WSL(Linux Subsystem) bash.\r\nThe original PowerShell console does support bash and hotkey copy/paste.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Installed Powershell using following command\r\n```\r\niex \"& { $(irm https://aka.ms/install-powershell.ps1) } -UseMSI\"\r\n```\r\n2. Type bash to enter Ubuntu in windows.\r\n3. Try to **use hotkeys, such as Ctrl-V or Ctrl-P**  OR **right-click in the window.**\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nPaste information copied.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nNo response in the console.\r\nSee attached photo for info.\r\n```\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/10NJyFhcM-XC4G5FQL4NjzkYeM91SM0sl/view\r\n```\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22290914/66306365-e14f4180-e91a-11e9-87eb-f655a20e3f67.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\nSee the photo link above.\r\nNote: Github's markdown editor's URL does not allow me to use the photo from google drive as a link.
