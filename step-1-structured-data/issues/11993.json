  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThis is quiet a specific issue which is really geared to people using Dynamics AX 2012 R2 only. \r\n\r\nWhen I try to import the Microsoft Dynamics modules for 2012 R2. Some of the modules loaded ok (there are 3 in total) and some do not. The error I'm getting for Powershell 7 rc 3 is:\r\nCould not load file Microsoft.Dynamics.Ax.Framework.Management\r\n\r\nI'm blocked from using Powershell 7 until I can get to the bottom of this. Help! :)\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n",

So it might a possible test case to investigate why this is not working. I wasn't really expecting answer to the question to be honest. Also 2012 R2 is out of support as well, so I think I'm stuck with the issue",
