  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThe ability to open a terminal with elevated rights: e.g. in Windows \"Open Terminal as Administrator\"\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nThis would be welcome when one typically should be running VS Code as a standard user, though there may be a need to execute code with elevation.  Currently executing with elevation within VS Code requires opening VS Code with elevation.\r\n\r\nI am primarily a Windows PowerShell user, though I can see this being helpful for PowerShell in other OS and possibly terminals for other code languages.\r\n",
