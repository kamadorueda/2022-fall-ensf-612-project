Today [it is hardcoded](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/mscorlib/src/System/Environment.cs#L360) \"4.0.30319.42000\"\r\nI believe we should restore it for backward compatibility.\r\nAnd the next question is whether we need something else useful here? \r\n- NetCoreApp ? (Microsoft.Extensions.PlatformAbstractions.PlatformServices.Default.Application.RuntimeFramework.Version)\r\n- real CLR runtime version? There is no native way to get it https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/issues/8815 \r\n[Comment](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr/blob/master/src/mscorlib/src/System/Environment.cs#L360) : \r\n>Starting with 4.6 we switched to a file versioning\r\n\r\nSo we would read the version from coreclr.dll - how to find it?",
