I don't think this property is actually useful particularly since we have the GitCommitId now.  Perhaps we should remove it even though it's a breaking change. @joeyaiello ",

We don't have any reason or plans to move from GitHub and git now that we are Open Source, the GitCommitId literally allows someone to build the same version that was used to report an issue (if needed).  It's really only intended to be useful for developers of PSCore6.  End users should rely on PSVersion.",
