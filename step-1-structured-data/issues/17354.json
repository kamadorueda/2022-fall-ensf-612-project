  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nWhen running the NAVSEA tool Evaluate-STIG, it identifies two directories \r\n\r\n/tmp/.dotnet\r\n/tmp/.dotnet/shm\r\n\r\nthat do not have the sticky bit set.  These directories are created by powershell.\r\nTo satisfy the STIG Item Vul ID: V-230243  Rule ID: SV-230243r792857_rule\t STIG ID: RHEL-08-010190,\r\nthese two directories must have the sticky bit applied.  I have not identified any adverse behavior after applying the sticky bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nIdentification:\r\nsudo find / -type d \\( -perm -0002 -a ! -perm -1000 \\) -print 2>/dev/null -ls\r\n/tmp/.dotnet\r\n      142      0 drwxrwxrwx   3  admin    admin          17 May 16 09:49 /tmp/.dotnet\r\n/tmp/.dotnet/shm\r\n  4194498      0 drwxrwxrwx   2  admin    admin           6 May 16 10:09 /tmp/.dotnet/shm\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nRecommendation:\r\n1. Do not create _world-writable_ temp directories on Linux unless required (perm 775 or 770)\r\n2. If creating world-writable temp directories on Linux, set the sticky bit (perm 1777)\r\n\r\nResolution:\r\nchmod +t /tmp/.dotnet\r\nchmod +t /tmp/.dotnot/shm\r\n\r\n\r\n",
