      "body": "I'm not sure I understand this need. What is the desire to have so many different PowerShell *nix packages?\n\nDevelopers needing different versions of PowerShell are going to consume NuGet packages through an entirely separate route, so that's not an issue here. Why would users need so many different *nix packages for PowerShell? If users absolutely need (and I don't know where this need is coming from for *nix) to install multiple copies of PowerShell, they would just leverage their packaging tools to install them to different locations.\n\nI think we should revisit this once we have customer input, and a release cadence :smile: \n",

      "body": "Here's the rundown of the solution @joeyaiello and I worked out:\n\nWe will maintain the following packages:\n- powershell\n  - named powershell\n  - owns /usr/bin/powershell symlink\n  - follows latest version\n  - ships binaries for developer preview\n  - installs binaries to /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0-alpha\n- powershell6.0\n  - named powershell6.0\n  - owns /usr/bin/powershell6.0 symlink\n  - version is 6.0\n  - ships 6.0 binaries\n  - installs binaries to /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0\n  - _does not_ own /usr/bin/powershell\n- powershell6.1\n  - named powershell6.1\n  - owns /usr/bin/powershell6.1 symlink\n  - version is 6.1\n  - ships 6.1 binaries\n  - installs binaries to /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.1\n  - _does not_ own /usr/bin/powershell\n- powershell7.0\n  - named powershell7.0\n  - owns /usr/bin/powershell7.0 symlink\n  - version is 7.0\n  - ships 7.0 binaries\n  - installs binaries to /opt/microsoft/powershell/7.0\n  - _does not_ own /usr/bin/powershell\n- powershell-test (or alpha or preview)\n  - named powershell-test (ditto)\n  - owns /usr/bin/powershell-test (ditto) symlink\n  - version is latest test/alpha/preview/nightly\n  - ships latest test/alpha/preview/nightly binaries\n  - installs binaries to /opt/microsoft/powershell/test (ditto)\n  - _does not_ own /usr/bin/powershell\n- etc.\n\nObviously 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, etc. are not out yet, and we do not need to create these packages immediately. Open question is if we start making a `-test` package now, or wait until we have a repository.\n\nThe primary goals of this approach are:\n- system `powershell` that is automatically updated (for the common scenario of a user just wanting `powershell`)\n- extra side-by-side explicitly versioned packages that do not conflict with `powershell`\n  - meaning that they own only `powershell6.0`, so that workloads which require an explicit version will have the ability to use it without digging up an absolute path (this is similar to there being both `python` and `python3` packages\n- satisfies both worlds by having a system `powershell` **and** side-by-side versions (not either/or)\n- ability to start by simply updating our current package, without requiring the immediate creation of the other packages (not an immediate switch to meta-package + dependency)\n- ability to update the `powershell` package to become a meta-package that simply causes a dependency to be installed (once a repository is available), but without having to do so immediately (as we don't have a repo yet)\n- all packages satisfy the Linux package managers' expectations\n  - they do not conflict with each other\n  - their package name and shipped binary match\n  - they are self-contained and can be manually installed/removed\n",

      "body": "> What is the purpose of the -test package and why do we need it?\n\nIt's not something we need to decide on or create right now. I believe it will be useful to provide a simple `powershell-test` / `powershell-nightly` package (once we have a repository and nightly build infrastructure) with the latest builds for ease of testing. But it's for the future.\n\n> I thought we had a proposal to add ability to get version info from powershell --version\n> Useful if I want to know the PSVersion of default powershell before starting it.\n\nYes, we have that proposal. But it doesn't affect this.\n\n> How does OMI remoting registrations work with this model? Are the remoting binaries and configuration shipped as as part of individual powershell versions?\n\n@paulcallen will need to address this. Remoting in (Linux as server) binaries exist outside of PowerShell (they live in OMI) and need to know the location of the PowerShell libraries, which are well-known. Remoting out binaries (Linux as client) live with PowerShell, so are part of the package. For remoting in, logic will need to be added to the OMI provider to choose a PowerShell version from the list of available versions.\n",
