  "body": "The problem:\r\n`get-childitem env:` fails on Windows when an environment variable exists twice, each instance cased differently.\r\n\r\nThe scenario:\r\nOn Windows, set the environment variable `NPM_CONFIG_PATH` to control where the npm cache is created. And use npm to run unit tests, use powershell within a unit test, and from powershell invoke `get-childitem env:`. Note, it is common to use `npm test` to build and test a nodejs project.\r\n\r\nIt appears npm internally creates environment variables to manage state, and a lower-case variable `npm_config_path` is created. When powershell is invoked from the unit test, the environment variables `NPM_CONFIG_PATH` and `npm_config_path` are both set.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOn Windows, tested with npm v5.6.0 in my PATH.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nWrite-Host \"******************** SETTING NPM_CONFIG_PATH ********************\"\r\n$null = mkdir env-test\r\ncd env-test\r\n$env:NPM_CONFIG_PATH = $PWD\r\nWrite-Host \"******************** CREATING PACKAGE.JSON ********************\"\r\n& npm init --force --yes\r\nWrite-Host \"******************** MODIFYING PACKAGE.JSON ********************\"\r\n$package = Get-Content package.json | ConvertFrom-Json\r\n$package.scripts.test = \"pwsh -command Get-ChildItem env:\"\r\nSet-Content -LiteralPath package.json -Encoding UTF8 -Value (ConvertTo-Json -InputObject $package -Depth 99)\r\nGet-Content package.json\r\nWrite-Host \"******************** TESTING ENV PS DRIVE, VIA NPM ********************\"\r\n& npm test\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nPowerShell should gracefully handle the duplicate environment variable. The `set` builtin in cmd.exe handles it gracefully. .NET `Environment.GetEnvironmentVariables()` handles it gracefully.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nGet-ChildItem fails with \\\"An item with the same key has already been added. Key: NPM_CONFIG_PATH\\\"\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

I'm open to the change if the cost of the change is justified, but the cost of the change is increased complexity and therefore maintenance.\r\n\r\nOur provider remains case-insensitive, case-preserving.  You can never assign two variables with the same case (due to dotnet behavior and we have tests to verify this.)  I chose this implementation over the other implementations because it was simpler with the only side effect occurring during the scenario we are fixing.\r\n\r\nFixing this while preserving the case insensitive dictionary would require additional specialized logic for windows, while this fix removed the specialized logic for windows.  I believe the side-effects are reasonable unless I'm incorrect about them being limited to the scenario being fixed.  ",
