Set \"message\" to optional is not best practice, from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd878348%28v=vs.85%29.aspx :\n   \u2022Each parameter set must have at least one unique parameter. If possible, make this parameter a mandatory parameter.\n   Set both \"message\" and \"title\" to optional open a way to \"anonymous\" request of credential. That is bad. This provokes writing bad code.\n2. Set \"message\" to optional also breaks backward compatibility: script running in version 6 will not work in the previous versions if \"message\" is empty.\n",

In this specific case, there are benefits to not making `-Message` mandatory - one can pass a custom `-Title` and use the default _localized_ message.\n\nAnd correct me if I'm wrong, but are there really compatibility issues?  All previous versions of PowerShell support calling `Get-Credential` with no parameters, #2330 just improves the user experience.\n",

I was very conservative. I modeled various combinations of parameters (default and non-default, localized and non-localized) and think that as best practice the script writers will have to specify the message and title in a pair without the requirement that message is mandatory.\n\nSo you can dicard the PR. @lzybkr  thanks for great discussion!\n",
