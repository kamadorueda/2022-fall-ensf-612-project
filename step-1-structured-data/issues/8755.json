      "body": "@iSazonov well, if you look at the original linked issue https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/7562, I opened it :)\r\n\r\nThe discussion in the @PowerShell/powershell-committee on a different topic acknowledged that PowerShell should have had more `Test-*` cmdlets rather than having scripts rely on `Get-*` with error handling and checking against `$null`.  Also, with more `Test-*` cmdlets, it would make it feasible to use cmdlets directly as DSC resources (Get/Set/Test).  It's unlikely the PowerShell team would spend the time implementing this.  However, this specific cmdlet should be relatively easy and straightforward and would encourage the community to pick it up.",
