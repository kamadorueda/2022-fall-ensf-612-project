      "body": "First, I'm not proposing changing the parser at all. I contributed to the idea behind `--%`, but I think it doesn't solve the problem in part because it's hard to discover and the concept is missing from other shells, so you'll rarely see examples.\r\n\r\nMy solution to this problem is elegant and robust. The parameter binder already has the Ast for the value - we can analyze the Ast to see if it's \"pure\" and if so, use the extent text instead of `ToString()` for certain types like `hashtable` or `scriptblock`.\r\n\r\n\"pure\" might have different meanings - e.g. a scriptblock expression is probably only pure if there is no whitespace at all.  A hashtable is probably \"pure\" if it references no variables and invokes no commands and has no whitespace.  Or something like that, I haven't thought enough about it yet.",
