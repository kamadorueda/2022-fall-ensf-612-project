  "body": "This can be observed by testing the GPRegistryPolicyParser module using PowerShell 7.1. When Get-Content is called to read files exported from Group Policy using Backup-GPO, a warning is written that 'byte' is not a valid input for -encoding parameter. However, it does not seem that the module is functionally impacted. It still does what it is intended to do, other than returning the error.\r\n\r\nCould someone from PowerShell advise the best approach for the issue in the other repo? If 'byte' is no longer available, should we remove the -encoding parameter, or use some other value?\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/GPRegistryPolicyParser/issues/6\r\n\r\n",
