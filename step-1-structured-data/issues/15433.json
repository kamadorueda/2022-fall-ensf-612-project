  "body": "Hi\r\nIt seems that WSMan is not available in the Linux environment. For example, the following command\r\n```\r\nSet-Item WSMan:\\localhost\\Client\\TrustedHosts -Value \"10.1.1.50\" -force\r\n```\r\nWorks on windows client. However, on Ubuntu 20.04 with powershell 7.1, I get this error\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS /home/mahmood> Set-Item WSMan:\\localhost\\Client\\TrustedHosts -Value \"10.1.1.50\" -force\r\nSet-Item: Cannot find drive. A drive with the name 'WSMan' does not exist.\r\n```\r\nIs there any alternative for that? Or WSMan is totally incompatible with Linux?",
