      "body": "For Linux, CoreFx assigns -1 as default value for BackgroundColor and ForegroundColor.  There's nothing we can do about that.  \n\nBut #730 fixed a problem where ForegroundColor always got overridden by PowerShell, so user preference should now stick.\n\nAs for #3, Linux does not capability to retrieve Window Title.  I've written a workaround so that if one sets the title from within PowerShell, I will display a cached copy of the title if one tries to display the value.  This works fine as long as one doesn't change the title external to PowerShell.\n",
