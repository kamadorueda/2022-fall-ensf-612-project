  "body": "Fix #3651\r\n\r\nIssue Summary\r\n-----------------\r\nIn PSv5.0, an instance of a PowerShell class is not bound to any Runspace. In PSv5.1, a PowerShell class instance by default is bound to the Runspace where the class is defined. This change was for safety and reliability purpose, but it does break applications that depend on the PSv5.0 behavior. So we need to support a way to allow users to intentionally create a PowerShell class instance that is not bound to any Runspace.\r\n\r\nFix\r\n---\r\nTo create an instance not pre-bound to any Runspace, just create the instance from a Runspace other than the one where the corresponding powershell class is defined.\r\nTo officially support this approach, we need to remove the `Diagnostics.Assert` that guards this situation, and also add tests to cover this scenario.",
