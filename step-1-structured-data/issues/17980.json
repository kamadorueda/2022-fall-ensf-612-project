All you need is to add a single line `& \"path/to/my/repo/profile.ps1\"` to `$PROFILE`. Instead of git, you can use OneDrive, Google Drive or anything else that syncs files. ",

When moving onto a new machine, what do you have to do manually now that would be automated? ssh config is just couple files stored in `~/.ssh`. You can synchronize them yourself using methods describe above, but keep in mind that storing your ssh keys on other servers may be very risky.",

      "body": "Symlinking on Windows requires elevated prompt or developer mode enabled. In my case, I found that invoking synchronized profile from `$PROFILE` works better, so that I can still have machine-specific code, e.g. setting up proxy on my work machine. Symlinking also can have surprising behavior when using relative paths - if you invoke a script via symlink, is `$PSScriptRoot` the folder of the link, or its target? What if you symlink entire folder?\r\n\r\nBut yeah, symlinks are a decent general solution as they can be used for entire directories regardless of contents, like ssh config, or config of whatever terminal you use.",

Every once in a while something would convert to the native path but it didn't seem to have any ill-effects.  I think the behaviour has changed in Windows 11's file explorer, it shows the symlink as a shortcut and at one time I'm sure it navigated to the onedrive directory - possibly I had setup the link differently, but I don't notice myself ending up in the onedrive directory by accident these days. \r\n\r\nThe client I'm working for at present doesn't allow their machines to connect to personal onedrives - although the `My Documents` folder goes to _business_ one drive so my Profile directory is sync'd / backed up and allows me to go back to old versions. On their machine I have a symlink between profile.ps1 in the WindowsPowerShell and PowerShell directories, so yes you can do it it for files or subdirectories if that's more appropriate.  \r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://jamesone111.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/image_thumb.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://s1.wp.com/i/favicon.ico\" height=\"14\"> James O'Neill's Blog</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://jamesone111.wordpress.com/2013/02/08/getting-skydrive-to-sync-the-way-i-want-like-mesh/\">Getting SkyDrive to sync the way I want (like Mesh)</a></strong></div><div>A few days ago Geekwire ran a story entitled \u201cMicrosoft, Let\u2019s be friends\u201d It began Dear Microsoft, Can we just be friends again?
