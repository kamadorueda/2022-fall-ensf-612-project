  "body": "Rough thinking here: for stuff like [globbing](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/1-Draft/RFC0009-Glob-for-Native-Tools.md) the @PowerShell/powershell-committee discussed the ability to introduce experimental features that people can opt into in alpha/beta builds. Something like `Get-/Enable-/Disable-PSExperimentalFeature`. \r\n\r\nI actually might try to implement this myself if I get some free time. :) ",
