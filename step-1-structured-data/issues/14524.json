      "body": "Note that many utilities, notably those with a Unix heritage, _conditionally_ apply coloring (via VT / ANSI escape sequences) to their output, namely based on whether their stdout stream is connected to a _terminal_ (DO color) or not (do NOT color).\r\n\r\nBackground jobs aren't directly connected to a terminal, which probably explains why you're not seeing colored output.\r\n\r\nAt least some GNU utilities (preinstalled on Linux platforms) allow you to _unconditionally_ request colored output, \r\nusing `--color=always`, such as  `ls` and `grep`.\r\n\r\n",
