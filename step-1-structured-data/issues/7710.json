      "body": "Thanks, Steve! I checked in with @TylerLeonhardt who passed it along to @rjmholt, and after some brief suggestions I traced the cached conversion methods that get called from string->integral types to here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/e399b06cd23a8d9a7df9be5ed329471ba5b8eb82/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/LanguagePrimitives.cs#L2888-L2907\r\n\r\nMy initial thought so far is to add some kind of check in there to determine if the last two characters in this (possibly trimmed?) value are a multiplier or the last character is a type suffix, something kind of like...\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nScriptBlockAst result;\r\nchar lastChar = strToConvert[strToConvert.Length - 1];\r\nif (!lastChar.IsTypeSuffix() ||\r\n    lastChar == 'b' && strToConvert[strToConvert.Length - 2].IsMultiplierStart())\r\n{\r\n    result = Parser.ParseInput(strToConvert, out Token[] tokens, out ParseError[] errors);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then I think I can grab `tokens[0].Value` to determine the numeric value and use that. _However_, I don't know that invoking `ParseInput()` here is the **best** available option. It also sort of bypasses the _need_ for the latter half of this conversion expression, because the token's `.Value` property seems to hold the appropriate data type coming out of it, at least where any type suffix may be concerned.\r\n\r\nWould definitely appreciate some input from y'all on this, it's a fun little rabbit trail, but I don't want to get too far off track and in a direction that isn't useful to y'all. \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nEDIT: Spoke a little with @SeeminglyScience this morning, and he and I think it might be better if we can somehow decouple portions of `ScanNumberHelper` and `TryGetNumberValue` from the tokenizer stepping logic and reuse that, so that we're guaranteed self-consistent results without having to create an entire parser and tokenizer during this conversion, which is almost certainly an expensive operation. How doable that is, I don't know yet. Interesting thought though. \ud83d\ude04 ",

How doable that is, I don't know yet. Interesting thought though.\r\n\r\nMy personal feeling is as you say; casting numbers from strings here should work in exactly the same way as they would in the tokenizer (the easiest way being to share the function). If that requires no state, or can be decoupled from the tokenizer state, then the method may as well be shared and used in both places.\r\n\r\nI don't know how expensive it is to create a new tokenizer (or if it's possible to do outside of the parser with current type access) but to my mind, casting is often associated with some overhead, so it's not the end of the world if the first implementation is not as efficient as it could be.\r\n\r\nI would favour doing it consistently over making it fast, since once it's released we can improve the latter but improving the former would be a breaking change.",

There are a handful of callsites in `Parser.cs` where `new Parser()` is called that I replaced with the methods here, and it seems to work just fine. Whether there's any performance benefit I'm not clear on.\r\n\r\nThink it's worth including in #8681?",

You can see the code that does that [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/b779b88c79d9fe30e5ef8061ec3eabd35beffbf4/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/Parser.cs#L181).\r\n\r\nI think there is significant risk in reusing parser instances. A specific instance may be left in a state not suitable for another parsing task, and tracking down **how** the parser got into that state might be very difficult.  These bugs might not be hard to fix once understood, but I would expect issues to be hard to reproduce, possibly even non-deterministic.\r\n\r\nMaybe with some care you could a test that uses reflection to verify a `Parser.Reset` method resets every field in `Parser` **and** for instances that are reused - check that recursively - so `Tokenizer` is reset appropriately as well.  Without such a test, I'd be worried some new code gets added introducing a bug that could take a long time to surface.",

Doing a comparison between the two should be the best indicator, as well as being fairly future-proof in terms of ensuring it still properly covers the case that someone adds new members to the Parser class down the road. I think. \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nWould that test be best performed from Pester, do you think, or is xUnit preferable here?",
