I have a reference mock-up of how we could start doing it better going forward, and some folks have suggested different colours etc.\r\n\r\nThe syntax diagrams in documentation are, I believe, generated from the default help output initially, so although doc issues usually don't belong on this repo, there in an issue already for this so we can improve this in the PowerShell engine itself and then propagate the change into documentation.\r\n\r\nSee here: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/8692",
