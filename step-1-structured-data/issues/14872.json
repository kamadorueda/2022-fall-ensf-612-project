      "body": "Hi @daxian-dbw, I don't want to say that the link you provided doesn't work, because it does. However, having a single - shared - environment variable is a limitation when people are using multiple PowerShell releases at the same time.\r\n\r\nShould I update the original issue and say the different releases should check for updates to their release? \r\nI didn't consider preview releases before, but now I realize that those who are using three different releases, might want to get notified about the matching release.
