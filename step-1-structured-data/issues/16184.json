  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nAs a user I want to be able to do a full compare between two lists of objects. When one of the lists is empty, that would mean all the objects in the other list are different. This functionality can be used to build a sync deployment feature, where there is a defined list and an implemented list. \r\n\r\nOn first run the implemented list would be empty, and the defined list is not empty. Run it through the compare and use the SideIndicators to determine which items should be created, and which items should be removed. On further runs, the compare will still work to add new defined items, and remove items that are no longer defined.\r\n\r\nCurrently an empty difference or reference object returns nothing, and $null returns an error. To avoid breaking issues, the new behavior could be implemented with a switch Compare-Object -AllowNullOrEmpty.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n\r\n\r\n``` pwsh\r\n@(@{v=1}) |\r\n  Compare-Object `\r\n    -ReferenceObject @(@{v=1},@{v=2},@{v=3}) `\r\n    -PassThru `\r\n    -IncludeEqual |\r\n select v, SideIndicator\r\n\r\n# Existing behavior:\r\nv SideIndicator\r\n- -------------\r\n1 ==\r\n2 <=\r\n3 <=\r\n```\r\n``` pwsh\r\n@() |\r\nCompare-Object `\r\n    -ReferenceObject @(@{v=1},@{v=2},@{v=3}) `\r\n    -Passthru `\r\n    -IncludeEqual |\r\nselect v, SideIndicator\r\n\r\n# existing behavior returns\r\n\r\n# wanted behavior returns \r\nv SideIndicator\r\n- -------------\r\n1 <=\r\n2 <=\r\n3 <=\r\n```\r\n\r\n``` pwsh\r\n\r\n\r\n$null |\r\nCompare-Object `\r\n    -ReferenceObject @(@{v=1},@{v=2},@{v=3}) `\r\n    -Passthru `\r\n    -IncludeEqual |\r\nselect v, SideIndicator\r\n\r\n# existing behavior returns\r\nCannot bind argument to parameter 'DifferenceObject' because it is null.\r\n# wanted behavior returns \r\nv SideIndicator\r\n- -------------\r\n1 <=\r\n2 <=\r\n3 <=\r\n ",
