  "body": "The `Format-Table` command in PowerShell displays objects in a fundamentally similar manner as Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Microsoft Excel provides a conditional formatting feature that enables spreadsheet builders to change the display format of a cell, based on the value of the cell's contents.\r\n\r\nIt would be really great if a PowerShell user could add conditional formatting rules to object properties, using the `Format-Table` command. That way, let's say you have an object with a `Status` property. That property could be emitted as `Green` if its value is `Success` or `Red` if the property value is `Failed`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nName   Status\r\n----   ------\r\nStep 1 Failed (Red)\r\nStep 2 Success (Green)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example, you could add a custom property specifier in the `Format-Table` command as follows:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-SomeObjects | Format-Table -Property Name, @{ Name = 'Status'; Color = 'Green'; Value = '^Success$' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell today, we already have a similar syntax for building \"calculated properties.\" We could leverage a similar syntax to build colorized expressions in data tables. This capability would be useful to build PowerShell-based dashboards and presenting data in a more useful manner in the console.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTrevor Sullivan",
