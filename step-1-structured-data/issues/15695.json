This detects that situation and deserializes the array one object at a time. This greatly improves runtime characteristics and reduces memory usage when the json is an array of objects while preventing us from having to implement our own full json parser.\r\n\r\nThis PR does not improve performance of parsing a single large dictionary.\r\n\r\n<!-- Summarize your PR between here and the checklist. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nConvertFrom-Json is a core cmdlet for anyone using Powershell for Web APIs. The Cmdlet has very poor runtime characteristics. It takes a long time to deserialize json compared to other deserializing in other languages and it uses a lot of memory to deserialize (15x the size of the json).\r\n\r\nThis PR on its own increases memory usage as compared to master. Combined with https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/15684 this PR cuts memory usage and runtime by more than half.\r\n\r\nBenchmark for 100MB JSON file:\r\n\r\nMaster\r\n- Memory Usage: **1079.3671875 MB**\r\n- Runtime: **7256.4268 ms**\r\n\r\nThisPR Alone\r\n- Memory Usage: 1477.83203125 MB\r\n- Runtime: 6574.552 ms\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/15684\r\n- Memory Usage: 1077.58203125 MB\r\n- Runtime: 3885.0489 ms\r\n\r\nThisPR + https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/15684\r\n- Memory Usage: **451.390625 MB**\r\n- Runtime: **3077.3673 ms**\r\n\r\n<!-- Provide a little reasoning as to why this Pull Request helps and why you have opened it. -->\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [ ] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [ ] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.
