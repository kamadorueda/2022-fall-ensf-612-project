  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Use a multi layered keyboard layout like [Neo2](https://github.com/neo-layout/neo-layout/tree/master/windows)\r\n- Install PowerShell 7.0.0-preview1\r\n- Open PowerShell and enter a special character (ie. `-` or `$`). You need to hold the caps lock key to switch the input layer. \r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nOnly the special character is entered on the console. Ie. \r\n\r\n```none\r\nGet-ChildItem\r\n$PsVersionTable\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe special character is prefixed with an `@` sign: \r\n\r\n```none\r\nGet@-ChildItem\r\n@$PsVersionTable\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn fact, every press of the caps lock key (Key Code 20) enters an `@` sign. \r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
