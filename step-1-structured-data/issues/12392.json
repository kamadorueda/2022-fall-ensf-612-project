I'm not sure how you'd register that before that event would fire.\r\n\r\n> -  'Powershell.Terminating'  # crash or killed by click in the botton\r\n\r\nIf PowerShell crashes, it's not going to be in a state where it's safe to execute more code.  Does `PowerShell.Exiting` not work when the close button is clicked? I thought it did, or was supposed to.  If that doesn't work maybe that should be a separate issue.",

      "body": "I think we have an open issue around the `Exited` event specifically, something to do with it not working in some cases.\r\n\r\nThe issue with registering events around PowerShell's own start is that there is no PS code you can run in a powershell process _before_ it starts, which you would need to do in order to be able to trigger something on engine start.",

If you're able to run code, the process is already started.  That aside, what benefit would that provide over profiles?\r\n",
