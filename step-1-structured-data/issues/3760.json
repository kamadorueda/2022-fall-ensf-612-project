The maintainer must NOT use an underscore '_', a plus '+', or a period '.' as a delimiter. Version numbers used in compat libraries do not need to omit the dot '.' or change it into a dash '-' (see  Multiple packages with the same base name for more info on this case). \r\n\r\n>There are a few exceptions to the no underscore '_' rule. \r\n- httpd, pam, and SDL addon packages are excluded, refer to \" Addon Packages (httpd, pam and SDL) \". \r\n- packages that are locale specific, and use the locale in the name are excluded, refer to \" Addon Packages (locale) \". \r\n- Compat packages where the base package name ends in a digit. refer to \" Multiple packages with the same base name\" \r\n- packages where the upstream name naturally contains an underscore are excluded from this. Examples of these packages include: \r\n",
