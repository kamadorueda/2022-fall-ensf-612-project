  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a PowerShell user, I expect some (many!) conveniences with regards to comparisons and type conversions.  [dbnull]::value has had some improvement recently with #9794 but could use improvements with other comparisons, e.g. `[dbnull]::value -gt 10` should _not_ error out, at least from my perspective.\r\n\r\nA practical example.  Let's say I have a CMDB with dbnull in a few spots I want to do comparisons:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n#Example scenario with a function that uses Invoke-Sqlcmd2 to pull data\r\n    Get-XXXXServer | Where-Object{$_.VCNumCPUs -gt 8}\r\n    #Error for every line where VCNumCPU has DBNull value\r\n\r\n    #workaround before recent dbnull handling fix\r\n    Get-XXXXServer | Where-Object{[string]$_.VCNumCPUs -and $_.VCNumCPUs -gt 8}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere is precedence for this:  `$null -gt 10` is `$false`, and `10 -gt $null` is `$true`\r\n\r\nCheers!",

      "body": "\ud83e\udd14 interesting... would have to look at the binders for those operators to see if there's a specific provision for `$null` values like there was for `-eq` and `-ne`... Might also just be that there's not an available conversion path for `DBNull`->`int`.\r\n\r\nProbably both, unless I miss my guess. What do you think, @SeeminglyScience? ",
