  "body": "Part of the work for #3961\r\n\r\n`dotnet-runtime-2.0.0` Linux packages for Debian distributions depend on different lib packages on different distros, for example, `libicu52` on `ubuntu.14.04`, `libicu55` on `ubuntu.16.04`, `libicu57` on `ubuntu.17.04`, `libicu52` on `debian 8`, and `libicu57` on `debian 9`. A similar issue also happens to `libssl` -- `libssl1.0.2` on `debian 9` and `libssl1.0.0` on the rest debian distros.\r\n\r\nIn order to use a single DEB package for all distros, we need to depend on `-dev` packages, like `libicu-dev` and `libssl-dev`. However, dev packages are not meant for production software, and dotnet core has separate DEB package for each Debian distro, so I think we should do that too.\r\n\r\nSo for Debian distros, we have a separate package for each distro. For Red Hat family, we have a single RPM package, just like the `dotnet-runtime-2.0.0` package.\r\n\r\nEven though we have separate packages for Debian distros, we now can create them all from one single build. Given that AppImage current needs to be created on `ubuntu.14.04`, we can generate all pacakges from `ubuntu.14.04`.\r\nFor RPM package, we should generate it from `CentOS7`.",

      "body": "@TravisEz13 @adityapatwardhan The changes in `Start-PSPackage` looks huge, but actually is not that much. It shows a big chunk of changes because the existing script needs to be moved to `End { ... }` block due to the introduction of the dynamic parameter `-Distribution`. This dynamic parameter is enabled only if `-Type deb` is specified, so that we can indicate which Debian distro the package is targeting.",
