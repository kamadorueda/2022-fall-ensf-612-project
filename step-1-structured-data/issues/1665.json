  "body": "https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/edit/JamesWTruher/TestStatus/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md\n\nThe last sentence in the first section says:\n\nFor creating new tests, please review the documents on how to create tests for PowerShell.\n\nHowever, it links to the \"testing-guidelines\" folder than a specific doc which is not useful.  Is it supposed to link to \"Writing Pester Tests\" or something else?  Seems like we're missing a how-to on authoring and submitting new tests?\n",
