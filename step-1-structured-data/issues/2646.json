      "body": "To summarize the issue:\r\nThe cmdlet was used in a wrong way where the Boolean switch `-BodyAsHtml` was used in a similar fashion like `-Body`.\r\nSince the switch `-BodyAsHtml` takes no input object, the positional parameters kicks in. As all other parameters are named, the first positional parameter will be `-To`.\r\nHence the provided sample call\r\n```powershell\r\nSend-MailMessage -Cc foo@bar.com -BodyAsHtml 'Blablabla' -smtpserver exchange.bar.com -subject test -from tester@bar.com\r\n```\r\ncould be written as\r\n```powershell\r\nSend-MailMessage -Cc foo@bar.com -BodyAsHtml -To 'Blablabla' -smtpserver exchange.bar.com -subject test -from tester@bar.com\r\n```\r\n\r\nInput 'Blablabla' can be bound to parameter `-To` as it is of type string. No problem occurs during binding. \r\nLater the string values for `-To`,`-Cc` and `-Bcc` are checked for correct format. This happens in the following lines of code in `Send-MailMessage`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/1abf290f839f766400a64ddd8b853709489c8aa5/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/Send-MailMessage.cs#L286-L319\r\n\r\nIt can be seen that in Line 315 an error is written, but the cmdlet won't terminate because of this error.\r\n\r\nUltimately the mail will be sent, though the \"To\" member of the `_mMailMessage` object is empty.\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\n1. Make cmdlet parameters for `-To`,`-Cc` and `-Bcc` of type `System.Net.Mail.MailAddress`. This would perform a format check right away and abort the action if not all provided email addresses are valid.\r\nThis definitely would be a breaking change, since the current behavior allows invalid mail addresses to be specified, where PS will provide an error, but the mail could still be sent to all other addresses.\r\nThis current behavior can be convenient if you have a list of email addresses, but at least one mail address is not in the correct format, e.g.\r\n```powershell\r\nSend-MailMessage -To valid@test.com, notvalid@ ...\r\n```\r\nThe email would still be sent to all valid addresses.\r\n\r\n2. Validate that `-To` at least has one valid email address if addresses in `-Cc` and/or `-Bcc` are given. Easily spoken, the property \"To\" of `_mMailMessage` is not allowed to be empty.",
