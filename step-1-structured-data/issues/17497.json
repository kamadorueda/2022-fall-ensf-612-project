  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nRunning PowerShell 7.2.4, I am performing a long running process in a WinRM Remote Session, some of the steps cause a brief network disruption that is handled gracefully in PowerShell 5.1 by trying to reconnect for 5 minutes, succeeding, and then carrying on with the rest of the process.\r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 7.2.4 this recovery process starts, but just as it recovers a null reference exception is thrown from the ProgressPane.Hide() function. this is unhandled and causes the pwsh process to exit.\r\n\r\nI haven't had the opportunity to produce a minimal repo to reproduce this, I have however debugged this myself using the 7.2.4 tagged commit in the PowerShell repo. The exception is thrown on Line 179 of the ProgressPane.cs file which suggests that `_savedRegion` is null, this suggests there is some sort of threading issue.\r\n\r\nI have Implemented a fix locally that adds lock statements to ProgressPane.Hide() and ProgressPane.Show() functions which resolves the issue. However I'm not sure if that fix would be acceptable for the project. I will link the PR here shortly.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nRecover from network interruption in remote sessions and continue processing.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nNull reference exception while recovering causing process to terminate.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
