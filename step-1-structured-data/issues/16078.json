  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\n`Measure-Object` currently does not have a builtin alias. Suggest that `mo` be added to the built aliases. I did not see any native binary conflicts across Linux (Ubuntu 20.04), Windows, or MacOS (Big Sur).\r\n\r\nThe following is a bit laborious especially if you run the command first and then decide you wanted the count.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(gci -r -file).Count\r\n```\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nAdd `mo` as an alias for `Measure-Object`.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ngci -r- file | mo\r\n```",

Users can still create them locally for the convenience of working in an interactive session, but this is a _personal_ preference and this could be placed in user profile..",
