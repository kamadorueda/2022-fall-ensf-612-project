  "body": "Steps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nC:\\>mkdir \"[T]est\"\r\n\r\nC:\\>cd \"[T]est\"\r\n\r\nC:\\[T]est>pwsh.exe\r\nPowerShell v6.0.0-rc.2\r\nCopyright (c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nhttps://aka.ms/pscore6-docs\r\nType 'help' to get help.\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Programs\\PowerShell\\6.0.0-rc.2>\r\n```\r\n1. Make a directory called \"[T]est\".\r\n2. Run cmd (or powershell) and cd to the directory.\r\n3. Run powershell.\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowershell always starts in the folder the parent process runs it in, regardless of the name of the folder.\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\n3 observed behaviors:\r\n- Powershell starts in its home directory if the folder has left and right brackets. (ex: \"Te[st]\")\r\n- Powershell starts in C:\\ if the folder only has left brackets. (ex: \"Te[st\")\r\n- Powershell starts in the current directory if it only has right brackets. (ex: \"Te]st\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-rc.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-rc.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditional Information\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nHope this isn't a known issue, I've experienced it myself both when starting powershell from cmd and from Visual Studio Code (\"Open in Terminal\"). I've seen it discussed a little bit [here](http://mxii.eu.org/2017/03/19/powershell-explorer-square-brackets-and-unicode-paths/). It might be related to Issue #4726. Hope we can see this fixed.",
