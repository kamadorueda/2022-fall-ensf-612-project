For example:\r\n\r\n![2020-07-07_224514](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43397938/86881609-8f06a100-c0a3-11ea-8de9-b4b3c1425290.png)\r\n\r\n[Bash style aliases allow parameters](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-bash-aliases/). It's a nice little feature.\r\n\r\n[This question on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4166370/how-can-i-write-a-powershell-alias-with-arguments-in-the-middle) received 72 upvotes, so I am not the only person to have this idea.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nWould probably need to modify the `Set-Alias` and `New-Alias` commands.",
