  "body": "Ideally, we should create a release branch and complete all release tasks using that branch, including generating all packages and update all docs, and then push the release tag and merge the release branch to master.\r\n\r\nHowever, this cannot be done currently because our build depends on the release tag to generate `GitCommitId` for `$PSVersionTable`. and thus the release tag has to be pushed before starting the release tasks.\r\n\r\nTo break this dependency, we should update `Start-PSBuild` to accept a GitCommitId string and update the Jenkins build script so that the GitCommitId string can be passed to the build pipeline.\r\n\r\nTasks\r\n------\r\n- [x] Update `Start-PSBuild` and `Start-PSPackage` to accept a `ReleaseTag` argument, which will override the git commit id retrieved from `git describe`. Resolved via #3921.\r\n- [x] Update our VSTS builder scripts to honor the `-ReleaseTag` flag. Resolved by @TravisEz13 via https://github.com/PowerShell/PSRelease/pull/13",
