  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nIn a discussion with @LeeHolmes, he brought up a scenario where to ensure consistency in automation, he doesn't want the user psmodulepath to take precedence over the system psmodulepath.  This is because a user module could override existing cmdlets that would be run from IT policy under the user context.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n@LeeHolmes proposes that `-NoProfile` also means don't include the user psmodulepath (or put it to the end rather than the beginning).  However, this would be a breaking change.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, we could add a new switch `-NoUserPSModulePath` to explicitly exclude the user paths in that particular invocation of `pwsh`.",
