In fact, unless it's 100% following the Debian guidelines, it's potentially inaccurate.\r\n\r\nIf it is in fact 100% compliant, I think the only thing that would really provide value to Debian users would be to add a renamed package to the Debian 8 repo on packages.microsoft.com. \r\n\r\nFor more context, the priority here is to make sure that we're compliant with Debians guidelines to the letter of the law that would allow it to be pulled into an official Debian repo in the future. \r\n\r\nIf that's not possible today, I'd instead recommend updating the install instructions to point Debian 8 at the Ubuntu package with a reference to the FrankenDebian guidance \r\n\r\nDoes that sound reasonable?

They are just named `<foo>_<VersionNumber>_<Arch>.deb`.  So I think we are fine with just the current name and can close this PR.  ",
