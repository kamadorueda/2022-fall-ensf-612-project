  "body": "When working with non-powershell commands, or cmdlets that don't have a pipeline input, I wish I could save a few keystrokes piping to them.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndir -r *.js | select -first 3 | % { git checkout -- $_ }\r\n```\r\n\r\nCould have a shortcut syntax like below (saves more than 10 keystrokes, including holding shift key):\r\n\r\n```\r\ndir -r *.js | select -first 3 | %% git checkout\r\n```\r\n\r\nI actually have a [Pipe-Command](https://github.com/omidkrad/DevShell/blob/master/scripts/Pipe-Command.ps1) for that which I use frequently with the `%%` alias, but I thought this could be supported more natively in powershell because of its common use. Hence, this suggestion.\r\n",
