  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently the `.csproj` files for build reference assemblies are generated on-the-fly (the content is kept in a resource.psd1 file as templates).\r\nWe need a way to update the version of nuget packages referenced by those `.csproj` files, and the proposal is to have the .csproj files checked in, and then we can use the DependBot to manage the version of nuget packages referenced by those .csproj files.\r\n\r\nAlso, the generated SDK nuget packages are currently declared as `netstandard2.0`. We should change it to `netcoreapp2.1` as the runtime libraries are `netcoreapp2.1` specific.",
