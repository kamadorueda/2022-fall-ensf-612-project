For the binary file I just took a checkout from the HEAD of the source-depot branch. This commit is just an application of the changes.\n\nI think this avoids any issues with orphan branches or reverting.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/825)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
