  "body": "While using SSH as a PowerShell remoting transport, any error text from the SSH client is turned into a remoting transport error and the session is ended.  However, only one line of the message is saved before the session is ended.  This is a problem for SSH client error messages that are multi-line, only the first line is recorded in the transport exception and the user cannot know what the error is about.\r\nSee Issue #3546\r\n\r\nThis fix modifies the SSH transport code to read multiple lines from the error stream.  Since it is impossible to know how many error lines will be sent by the SSH client the stream reader runs asynchronously with a 1 second timeout per line.",
