  "body": "- [x] Resolves issue #1357 .\n- [x] Code is [rebased](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/git/README.md#sync-your-local-repo) on `origin/master`.\n\nThe two places that needs to be updated are not yet available in Unix Powershell. Thus no test case can be added this time.\n\nI tried to make update upon my old branches but could not figure out how to fix the sync up issue at the moment. Thus I decide to start from clean branch and continue to learn more about git hub stuff on the go.\n",
