There are still a handful of odd edge cases and it's a bit weird to get used to working with, but on the whole it's a ton easier than hand-crafting MAML.",

Localization is the primary reason to have downloadable help in MAML. \r\n\r\nLook at the following example of help for `Get-Process`. As you can see the description and related link blocks can get very long. It would just make the C# code look messy. Though adding a attribute property for Synopsis could be fine. Still MAML / PlatyPS is the right way to go as it also allows you to specify examples, which I believe are most useful.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nNAME\r\n    Get-Process\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n    Gets the processes that are running on the local computer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTAX\r\n    Get-Process [[-Name] <String[]>] [-FileVersionInfo] [-Module] [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n    Get-Process [-FileVersionInfo] -Id <Int32[]> [-Module] [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n    Get-Process [-FileVersionInfo] -InputObject <Process[]> [-Module] [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n    Get-Process -Id <Int32[]> -IncludeUserName [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n    Get-Process [[-Name] <String[]>] -IncludeUserName [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n    Get-Process -IncludeUserName -InputObject <Process[]> [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n    The `Get-Process` cmdlet gets the processes on a local computer.\r\n\r\n    Without parameters, this cmdlet gets all of the processes on the local computer.

You can also use the parameters of the `Get-Process` cmdlet to\r\n    get file version information for the program that runs in the process and to get the modules that the process\r\n    loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATED LINKS\r\n    Online Version: https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-process?view=power\r\n    shell-7&WT.mc_id=ps-gethelp\r\n    Debug-Process\r\n    Get-Process\r\n    Start-Process\r\n    Stop-Process\r\n    Wait-Process\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "@adityapatwardhan PlatyPS is good if you want many changes. We are happy with the default PowerShell Help except we need one or 2 additional sections. We generate code for our cmdlets so it wouldn't be a big deal for us to include these as attributes in our code irrespective of how unwieldy those attributes look.\r\nWhile using PlatyPS, we are having to go through multiple steps - Generate MD files from PlatyPS; those MD files have sections which are not complete. Generate some intermediate XML files with the info that we need to populate the MD files empty sections generated by PlatyPS. Use these MD files to finally patch the MAML files that we need for help text. The MAML files are missing the Synopsis section (probably due to a bug in PlatyPS that we have filed with them).\r\nIf the above feature that we are asking for was supported, we had much simpler process for help text generation.",

One solution to that is to use a resource file.
