It might make issues caused by the use of `-Path` instead of `-LiteralPath` to show up less frequently but will make them harder to trace when they finally show up.\r\nUsing wildcards by default and literal path as an option was a major design mistake, imo. This patch makes a step back, but in a way that makes it less predictable. Is it OK to have more \"magic\"?\r\n\r\nI also wonder why it was made in this way instead of just calling `Set-Location` with `-LiteralPath` when initializing a session? Working folder is by definition a literal path. It would've kept behavior changes to minimum.",
