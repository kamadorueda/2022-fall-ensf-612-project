  "body": "This is a small but powerful improvement for PowerShell. I regularly use PowerShell to run commands for my programming work like starting builds, deploying cloud functions, running scripts etc.. \r\n\r\nThe press arrow up feature to get the previous command is very helpful, but cumbersome to use when repeating the same command often.\r\n\r\nWhen developing, I often have to run the same commands a lot of times in a row. \r\nExample:\r\n1.) start server command\r\n2.) change code -> run script command\r\n3.) change code -> run script command \r\n.....\r\n50.)  change code -> run script command\r\n*ends coding session*\r\n\r\nNow here is the issue. The next time I start the terminal I would like to select the start server command again by pressing arrow up button. The problem is though, that I have to press is like 50 times before it shows that command. I'm assuming that there is some kind of list that is iterated through 1 row each time the arrow up button is pressed. \r\n\r\nIt would be extremely helpful, if the \"press arrow up\"-function would not repeat the same command, but always show the next different command. (increase i until next command is different then currently show command). (same goes for arrow down)\r\nIn my example that would mean: When I start the terminal and press arrow up once it shows the  \"run script command\" and when pressing it the second time it shows the \" start server command\"\r\n\r\nMaybe you can make that change? I would SO MUCH appreciate it!",

IIRC you need this bit of configuration to make that work:\r\n```\r\nSet-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Chord UpArrow   -Function HistorySearchBackward\r\nSet-PSReadlineKeyHandler -Chord DownArrow -Function HistorySearchForward\r\n```\r\nFinally, give the new PSRL 2.1.0 Beta a try.  It provides completion prediction functionality (I typed in only `dot` below - the rest is the prediction) e.g.:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5177512/80992200-67226500-8df6-11ea-9f8e-5432f23d5d44.png)\r\n\r\nSee this PSReadLine issue for more details: https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/issues/687\r\n",
