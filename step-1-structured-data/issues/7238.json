  "body": "The following command takes more than 2 times as long in PowerShell Core than in Windows PowerShell. I don't see the reason for this huge difference on the same OS instance (Windows 10). I repeated the test several times and these results are on hot filesystem cache (no actual I/O). During the tests in both PowerShell versions I observed the same CPU load (around 18% on a 4-core 8-thread i7 system).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nSet-Location $ENV:UserProfile\r\nMeasure-Command { Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Measure-Object }\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput in PowerShell Core on my profile folder (153000 files):\r\n\r\n```none\r\n(...)\r\nTotalSeconds      : 22,439892\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 22439,892\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput in Windows PowerShell on the same folder:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n(...)\r\nTotalSeconds      : 10,8080086\r\nTotalMilliseconds : 10808,0086\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n$PSVersionTable:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.17134.137\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.17134.137\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```",
