  "body": "This fixes addresses issue #4940.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the connection clean up code in SSHClientSessionTransportManager would try to terminate a process with id == 0, which is the initial value for the _sshProcessId field when no SSH process has been created yet.  For both Linux and Windows platforms process id of zero is a special process and should not be terminated.  Fortunately those processes are not terminated by the existing code but on Linux platforms the PowerShell parent process exits immediately.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add checks that the SSH process has been created and is valid before terminating it during connection cleanup.",
