  "body": "Fix #3649\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n----------\r\nMove PowerShell to .NET Core `2.0.0-preview3-25426-01` by explicitly specify the `RuntimeFrameworkVersion` in .csproj files. `2.0.0-preview3` CLI doesn't work (see https://github.com/dotnet/cli/issues/7013, it's closed but I don't think it should be), so we use .NET CLI `2.0.0-preview2-006502` for now.\r\n\r\nAlso add `test/Test.Common.props` to hold common properties for test projects.\r\n\r\nNote\r\n-----\r\nI have verified the CoreFx issues listed in #3649 are fixed in this .NET Core version.\r\nI have verified that `PackageManagement` and `PowerShellGet` tests are all passed.\r\nI have verified that `Login-AzureRmAccount` from `AzureRM.Netcore` works in powershell with this .NET Core version.
