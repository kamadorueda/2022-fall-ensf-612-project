  "body": "This is to notify and discuss what happens when Ubuntu 16.04 will reach EOL on April 30, 2021. Technically speaking, Canonical also provides extended security maintenance after that, but that is a special enterprise agreement, therefore I assume that PowerShell will stop support for Ubuntu 16.04 on April 30, 2021 as per support policy: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-support-lifecycle?view=powershell-7.1#unsupported-platforms\r\nCan you please confirm my understanding is correct? Personally I do not see an issue with that but just wanted it to be confirmed.\r\n\r\nHere is an (incomplete) list of docs that definitely need updating after that:\r\n- https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/docs-conceptual/PowerShell-Support-Lifecycle.md\r\n- https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/README.md\r\n- https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/docs-conceptual/install/Installing-PowerShell-Core-on-Linux.md",
