This code will never run because of the previous if statement and in fact the code is duplicated in the HandleStopJobCompleted() where it is correct.  So we can simply remove the code at line 164.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar parentJob = job as ContainerParentJob;\r\nif (parentJob != null && parentJob.ExecutionError.Count > 0)\r\n{\r\n    foreach (\r\n        var e in\r\n            parentJob.ExecutionError.Where(\r\n                e => e.FullyQualifiedErrorId == \"ContainerParentJobStopError\"))\r\n    {\r\n        WriteError(e);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@PaulHigin I seem to be missing something with this issue and the associated PR.  HandleStopJobCompleted appears to be only used for Job2 instances and not Job instances. While the code is duplicated, removing it for Job instances doesn't appear to be correct.\r\n\r\nPaul explained it to me off line. Job does not derive from ContainerParentJob so, other than the job.StopJob() statement, the rest of the else cause is dead code.",
