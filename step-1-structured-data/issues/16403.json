  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nIn a nutshell, support colored comand output the way `ls` does on *nix. That woud be a minimum. Then this can be improved during the feature design.\r\n\r\n```\r\n -C                    list entries by columns\r\n      --color[=WHEN]   colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default\r\n                       if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below\r\n...\r\nUsing color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and\r\nwith --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when\r\nstandard output is connected to a terminal.  The LS_COLORS environment\r\nvariable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.\r\n```\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
