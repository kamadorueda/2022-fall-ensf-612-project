      "body": "I see where the cursor visibility is being changed, I'll submit a PR, should be a simple fix.  Ok, hit an issue, on non-Windows, `[Console]::CursorVisible` is not supported.  This means it can't read if the cursor is currently visible or not.  So the problem is we don't want to just rely on the current cursor visibility as rendering progress would show the cursor.  So think the only thing we can do is support this for Windows for now.",
