I tried this in my branch [here](https://github.com/bergmeister/PowerShell/commit/7d3e202d653defb60a39840e43af4db317e4bb78) but I don't think it worked since there was no `*.XmlSerializers.dll` file in the publish folder. Maybe this is because we haven't fully switched to msbuild yet or because I don't have enough understanding of how the current build works.",
