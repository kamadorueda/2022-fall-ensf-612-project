  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nThis work is in the context of [Minimal PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/Internal-PowerShellTeam-Docs/blob/master/Planning/Manganese/minimal-powershell.md).\r\nCross platform DSC code that was in `System.Management.Automation.dll` is extracted as a PowerShell subsystem (this PR) and moved to a new `Microsoft.PowerShell.DscSubsystem.dll` to be shipped with `PSDesiredStateConfiguration` v3 module (PR in PSDesiredStateConfiguration repo).\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nThis PR is following guidelines from subsystem architecture document:\r\n* Cross platform DSC code is removed from `System.Management.Automation.dll` and placed into a new `Microsoft.PowerShell.DscSubsystem.dll` in `PSDesiredStateConfiguration` v3 module.\r\n* Subsystem interface `ICrossPlatformDsc` is defined in SMA and implemented in `Microsoft.PowerShell.DscSubsystem.dll`\r\n* Subsystem registration happens dynamically with the help of [`IModuleAssemblyInitializer.OnImport`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.management.automation.imoduleassemblyinitializer.onimport?view=powershellsdk-7.0.0) (implemented in `Microsoft.PowerShell.DscSubsystem.dll`) when `PSDesiredStateConfiguration` v3 module is loaded.\r\n\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [X] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [X] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [X] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [X] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [X] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [X] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [X] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.
