  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nIf using this code:\r\nGet-Credential | export-clixml ./test.xml\r\n#When Asked for the credentials leave password empty!!!\r\n$test = import-clixml ./test.xml\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\n$test should have a credential object, with an empty password.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nOn Linux this error is thrown:\r\n\"Import-Clixml: Cannot process argument because the value of argument \"input\" is not valid. Change the value of the \"input\" argument and run the operation again.\"\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nOn Windows with 5.1 and 7.1.4 this works, but it seems due to the different encoding written to file on linux, that the xml cannot be reimported. This error is thrown:\r\n\"Import-Clixml: Cannot process argument because the value of argument \"input\" is not valid. Change the value of the \"input\" argument and run the operation again.\"\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.4\r\nOS                             Linux 5.10.63-v7l+ #1457 SMP Tue Sep 28 11:26:14 BST 2021\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
