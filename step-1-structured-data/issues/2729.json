      "body": "You're right - it's a lot of boiler plate crap that is a PITA to have to write.  I've added snippets for some of this (primarily path processing) to the PowerShell extension for VSCode.  It seems like path processing is so common that there would be a specific `PathParameterAttribute` that would move all the grungy boiler plate code into PowerShell and provide your script's [string] or [string[]] parameter with all the properly resolved (tested for existence if the path must exist) and error appropriately (like when a \"must exist\" path doesn't exist).  Ah, I can dream.  :-)\n",
