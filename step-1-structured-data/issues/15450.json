This should be changed.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of places where I know it's a problem, but we should look through the rest of the completion code as well:\r\n\r\n- The \"Requires\"  statement completion\r\n- The Help keyword completion (not yet implemented, but will be after: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/15337 )",
