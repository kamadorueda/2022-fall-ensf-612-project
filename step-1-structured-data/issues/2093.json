  "body": "You can't tab through completions in powershell for os x. in windows I can type get-childitem and then keep hitting tab and run through all the possible completions. On OS X, hitting tab just prints out all the possible completions and that's it. you can't keep pressing tab and cycle through them.\nI found a way to correct this issue in bash.\n\nhttp://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20050904022246573\nbind '\"\\t\":menu-complete'\n",
