  "body": "The `Invoke-RestMethod` cmdlet since PowerShell 6 does not perform HTTP connection pooling.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour in Windows PowerShell 5.1 was to perform connection pooling, so there is a performance regression in PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n*This issue was discovered in #12764.*\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nWhile running a packet capture, compare execution of the following with execution under Windows PowerShell 5.1:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(Measure-Command {\r\n    (1..100).ForEach{\r\n        Invoke-RestMethod -Uri \"https://postman-echo.com/get?i=$_\"\r\n    }\r\n}).TotalSeconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nA single HTTP connection is used for all requests, as was the case in Windows PowerShell 5.1.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nA new HTTP connection is opened for every request and a TLS handshake is perfomed for each request, resulting in much worse performance than Windows PowerShell 5.1.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
