  "body": "This fixes issue #2607.\r\n'RequiredModules' is a field in module manifest that can reference other modules using ModuleSpecification format.\r\nThe basic version of this format (just module name) was working fine, however there was a problem when more detailed version of the format was used (the one that uses module versions or/and GUIDs).\r\nDuring module import, there is a check for cyclic references through 'RequiredModules' field. The bug was in this check for cyclic references , related to comparison rules for ModuleSpecification  objects - as a result code was incorrectly reporting 'cyclic reference' error in cases when there was none.\r\n\r\nAdded tests for different ModuleSpecification formats and a test for error when there is actually a cyclic reference.\r\n\r\nTest results before the fix:\r\n![requiredmodulefix_before](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11860095/25165483/a07f07fe-248b-11e7-9426-d14f4069b479.png)\r\n\r\nTest results after the fix:\r\n![requiredmodulefix_after](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/11860095/25165482/a064c3b2-248b-11e7-8c9c-147832e85139.png)",
