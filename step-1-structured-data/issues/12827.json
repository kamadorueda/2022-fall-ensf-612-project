The TimeStamp server URL must be fully qualified, and in the format http://<server \r\nurl>...._\r\n\r\n(URL does verify and work in the **http:**// variant)\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThe command should accept and use the HTTPS: ssl protocol request as it does with the HTTP: protocol. \r\nI speculate that the code that validates the input, does not accept https: as valid option. \r\n\r\nSecurity teams are all SSL(TLS) happy and would demand anything going over network be SSL (TLS) encrypted.
