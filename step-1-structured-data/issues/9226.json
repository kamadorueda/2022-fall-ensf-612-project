      "body": "@att0002, PowerShell is not itself a terminal emulator, it is  a shell that runs _inside_ of one, so this is not the right place for your suggestion.\r\n\r\nPowerShell Core works just fine with Tilda - by default, if it is your default shell, or via `Preferences >  Title and Command > Run a custom shell instead of the shell`.\r\n\r\nIf you want Tilda to work on macOS and Windows as well, please open a feature suggestion at https://github.com/lanoxx/tilda (while running on macOS may be a possibility, a Windows version sounds like a stretch).",
