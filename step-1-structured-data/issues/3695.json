Yet I don't see which threat is mitigated by restricting use of $_. I think many devs like Posh for its flexibility. Let's keep that flexibility.",

      "body": "I am not PowerShell/powershell-committee Team member so I can only give my understanding of the conclusion.\r\n\r\nFor personal using - Writing to $_ is bad practice in most cases and we do not wish to encourage such practices. In most cases, there are native workarounds that @mklement0  has demonstrated more than once. (Some may continue to use Windows PowerShell only but over time I'm sure they'll like PowerShell Core too)\r\n\r\nFor tools - There are tools/modules that use custom $_ . Sometimes it's also just a bad style. Sometimes this is forced to be used because there are no native alternatives. _In any case_, we want to preserve backward compatibility as much as possible. To do that, we can use a strict mode, [lexical strict mode](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/1-Draft/RFC0003-Lexical-Strict-Mode.md) and [Interop-Module](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/1-Draft/RFC0019-PowerShell-Core-Interop-Module.md).\r\n\r\nFor \"special things\" - Right way is to use native things. Currently PowerShell is Open Source and Community is free to implement natively things that have long been expected - [Concurrency](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/1-Draft/RFC0023-Native-Support-for-Concurrent-Programming-in-PowerShell.md), [DSL\r\n](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/3-Experimental/RFC0017-Domain-Specific-Language-Specifications.md) (Did you know we already have a pilot implementation in #3169?), also we have plans to enhance classes and finally, @lzybkr [proposal](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3695#issuecomment-322844832) \"to make public the API that allows setting  $_  when invoking a script block.\"\r\nNo doubts, all the popular packages mentioned above and not mentioned at all will have many benefits if such fundamental things are implemented natively in PowerShell Core. We don't want to force you to port the modules - they must continue to work, but their new versions will have these new benefits. We very much hope that you will actively participate in this work starting now.",

      "body": "My 2 cents as a PowerShell user:\r\nI definitely discourage re-purposing internal variables such as `$_`. If some 3rd party PowerShell script would start to break in a new version of Windows PowerShell then I'd be very upset but if I had to check my scripts and their 3rd party dependencies anyway when swiching to PowerShell Core then I would not mind it as it would be expected to have some breaking changes. The only risk would be if my testing would not invoke this 'naughty' code path so that I would not spot it. I guess most users would check portability only very loosely by testing if they can still import their modules and maybe executing it once through the main execution path.\r\n\r\nTo compare it to other scripting languages:  `Matlab` allows re-purposing of variables defined by it such as `pi` and even the imaginary variable `i` but it can easily lead to unintended behaviour when using e.g. `i` as a loop variable.",
