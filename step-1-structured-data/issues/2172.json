  "body": "This is a follow-up from #1590\n## Context\n\nCurrently, we are using **PSDesiredStateConfiguration 1.0.0-alpha01 nuget package** to deliver `PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1` in the final package, so DSC Configuration -> mof compilation can work on Linux.\n\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/48d87842b112bf6c42f1f295d3007e3a2ee39803/src/powershell-unix/project.json#L59\n\nIt's sub-optimal.\n\n`PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1` is a huge file that contains dynamic keyword `Configuration` definition (that's what we need for compilation) but also DSC runtime code.\n## Proposition\n\nWe can try to extract the code that is needed for `Configuration` compilation from `PSDesiredStateConfiguration.psm1` and replace nuget package by this separated, compilation-specific code.\n\ncc @nitinbps @nanalakshmanan @johnkord \n",
