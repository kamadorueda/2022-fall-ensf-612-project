  "body": "# Overview\n\nPowerShell's WinRM plugin must reside in a directory under %windir%\\System32 due to a WinRM security restriction. Since the plugin cannot be in the same directory as PowerShell, the plugin needs to detect which instance of PowerShell it should load. \n# Changes Required\n\nThe plugin shall be modified to support starting PowerShell from arbitrary locations. A config file shall be read to direct the plugin to the appropriate version of CoreCLR and PowerShell that it should load into its process. The exact file format and contents are up to us. A simple text file with KEY=VALUE pairs should be sufficient.\n## Configuration file contents:\n1. PSHOMEDIR - Points to the plugin's PSHome (SMA.dll directory)\n2. CORECLRDIR - Points to the instance's CoreCLR\n",
