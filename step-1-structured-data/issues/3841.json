  "body": "On a fully patched Server 2008r2 system, the remoting install script (Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1) installs the plugin, but WinRM rejects it as a corrupted plugin. This prevents PoweShell Core from accepting incoming PowerShell connections.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to install WMF 4.0 or higher prior to installing the plugin. This should be documented in the installation instructions for Windows.\r\n\r\nIf you encounter this issue, follow the instructions in the Winrm error message to delete the plugin using `winrm delete ...`",
