So after PkgMgmt fix, we may have additional failures.\r\n\r\nI don't know if we can really automate picking up latest .NET Core builds.  Part of the issue is that we need a coherent build which aligns the SDK, runtime, and ASPNETCORE which doesn't come out that frequently.  Also, there's usually changes in MSBuild that can break us.  This may have to stay as a manual process.\r\n\r\nOne we have a good build, we do have improvements in our Release Automation so we should (soon) be seeing daily runs across our entire supported platforms instead of just a specific version of Linux, macOS, and Windows.  (macOS may be limited to what AzDevOps supports...)",
