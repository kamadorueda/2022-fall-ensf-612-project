  "body": "## Remove conflicting aliases for Linux and OS X\n\nThe aliases which conflict with Linux native commands were consolidated\nand removed with the pre-processor definition `LINUX`. Additionally,\nseveral \"conflicts\" are purposefully kept and likewise consolidated.\nThey are kept because Bash itself stomps on the native commands with its\nown built-ins, and so we're adopting the same behavior.\n\nResolves #567.\n## Remove A:...Z: drive functions on Linux / OS X\n\nResolves #612.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/786)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
