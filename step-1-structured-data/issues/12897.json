A simple example is:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Job -Name Example -ScriptBlock {\r\n    $listener = [System.Net.HttpListener]::new()\r\n    $listener.Prefixes.Add('http://127.0.0.1:8080/')\r\n    $listener.Start()\r\n    $listener.GetContext()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCalling `Stop-Job -Name Example` will just hang forever, or take 5mins+ to stop on some machines. `Remove-Job -Name Example -Force` exhibits the same issue as well.\r\n\r\n(edit: changed the prefix so the example runs as non-admin as well)",
