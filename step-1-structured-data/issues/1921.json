I've just tested on it again after updating the system packages that it depends on and I get:\n\n```\nPS /root/downloads> Find-Module\nSegmentation fault\nroot@linode:~/#\n```\n\nI've installed the latest release `powershell_6.0.0-alpha.10-1ubuntu1.14.04.1_amd64.deb` and I still get the Segmentation fault as above. The Segmentation fault might have been the cause of the ssh session to terminate on Debian 8.5.\n\nI've also installed Debian 8.6 on a spare laptop and installed the latest release `powershell_6.0.0-alpha.10-1ubuntu1.14.04.1_amd64.deb` on it. and that gets the same Segmentation fault.\n\nI used gdb to get the Seg fault:\n\n```\nPS /etc> [New Thread 0x7fff56db4700 (LWP 8354)]\n[New Thread 0x7fff55db2700 (LWP 8355)]\n[Thread 0x7ffff00cf700 (LWP 8345) exited]\nFind-Module\n[Thread 0x7fff56db4700 (LWP 8354) exited]\n[New Thread 0x7fff56db4700 (LWP 8368)]\n[New Thread 0x7ffff00cf700 (LWP 8369)]\n[Thread 0x7ffff00cf700 (LWP 8369) exited]\n[New Thread 0x7ffff00cf700 (LWP 8372)]\n[Thread 0x7ffff00cf700 (LWP 8372) exited]\n\nProgram received signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault.\n[Switching to Thread 0x7fff56db4700 (LWP 8368)]\n0x00007ffff09632ad in SystemNative_EnumerateInterfaceAddresses () from /opt/microsoft/powershell/6.0.0-alpha.10/System.Native.so\n```\n\nIf that helps at all.\n\nThanks!\n",
