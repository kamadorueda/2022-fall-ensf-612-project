  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\n**What ?**\r\nThe retry function is a great function, but when the Web Request / API portal answers with\r\n401 UnAuthorized\r\nIt is likely that retrying is purely useless\r\n\r\n**Specification on the -MaximumRetryCount**\r\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/invoke-restmethod?view=powershell-7.2\r\n_Specifies how many times PowerShell retries a connection when a failure code between 400 and 599, inclusive or 304 is received. Also see RetryIntervalSec parameter for specifying number of retries._\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n**Ideally**, I think 401 should be removed from the list of errors that will try to get a retry on. It just does not mean anything to retry on that error code\r\n\r\n**Optionally**, I think it might also be good to add a switch where we could specify other ports we don't want to have retry on. \r\n\r\n- Example : -RetryIgnoredCode [int[]]\r\n- Description : List of error code on which the -MaximumRetryCount will not have a retry\r\n\r\nThere might be other cases where we don't want to have a retry on, depending on the web site.",
