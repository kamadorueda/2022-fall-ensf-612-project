  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSorry if this is a duplicate issue.\r\n\r\n1.  Start PowerShell 7 as a regular user (i.e., not an administrator) from the Start Menu (e.g., press Windows key, type \"powershell\", left-click PowerShell 7).\r\n2.  Right-click top of window, select \"Properties.\"\r\n3.  Change a setting (e.g., Opacity in the \"Colors\" tab).\r\n4.  Click \"OK\".\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe Properties window closes, any changes are saved and persist in future sessions.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe following error message window pops up:\r\n```none\r\nUnable to modify the shortcut: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\PowerShell\\PowerShell 7 (x64).lnk. Check to make sure it has not been deleted or renamed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanges to properties do not persist in future sessions.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, when opening PowerShell 7 via the context menu, whether or not you choose to run as an administrator, the expected behavior happens.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
