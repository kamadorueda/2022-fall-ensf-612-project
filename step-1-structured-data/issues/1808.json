It seems to me like it's an opportunity to use Python in this case.  Although I'm not a Python programmer I have figured out a raw sample for displaying results in a limited DataGrid-type view then integrate Python with PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThis is something to looked at! I think. And, I know it's going to take time to get it done.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n![poshpythingui_2017-05-07_9-50-40](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/19892435/25781690/cd792efa-330a-11e7-9906-9b967931f77c.jpg)\r\n",
