  "body": "I'm not sure if it's a bug or by design.  With the latest version of PS on Mac v6.0.0-beta.9 when I open PowerShell with the new \"pwsh\" command I have to run it as 'sudo'.  This seems to go against the normal as I wouldn't run PowerShell as administrator on Windows for everything I needed to peform.  I understand the need for 'sudo' if I'm installing modules or changing settings but why is it no longer allowed to run as a normal user in the lastest update?",
