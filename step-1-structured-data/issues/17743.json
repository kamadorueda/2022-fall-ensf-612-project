  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nThis repository already uses Dependabot but not for GitHub Actions used in workflows. I suggest enabling it to keep Actions updated.\r\n\r\nI see some old (major) versions used in various workflows, with CodeQL v1 being probably the most important one because it will be deprecated in December.\r\nhttps://github.blog/changelog/2022-04-27-code-scanning-deprecation-of-codeql-action-v1/\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nAdding it is pretty simple, just append [`dependabot.yml`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/bff54ba38dd3c2dac6d2fe5ebbdfa87d79df312e/.github/dependabot.yml):\r\n\r\n```yml\r\n  - package-ecosystem: \"github-actions\"\r\n    directory: \"/\"\r\n    schedule:\r\n      interval: \"daily\"\r\n```",
