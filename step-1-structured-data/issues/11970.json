  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\nI am finding the SSH remoting feature very useful but it is lacking a featrure that the raw ssh command has. Raw SSH allocates a pseudo-TTY automatically for interactive sessions and of given the parameter `-t` it will also do that for a batch session. Can there be a similar option for `New-PSSession` and `Enter-PSSession`? Pseudo-TTYs are a must to run `sudo` in a remote interactive shell. The workaround of using `<password> | sudo -s <command>` violates a commonly held tenet of not typing passwords where command history may save them.  It maybe acceptable to do so in a batch script but not in an interactive setting where the user is there to type teh password when prompted.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\nI propose a new parameter `-AllocateTTY` that would force allocate a pseudo-TTY. According to forums I have looked at the commonly used `Renci.SSHNet` library used for SSH in .NET applications surfaces this option in its APIs.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\nI expect that I can run sudo normally like when I use the normal ssh command whenever I create and enter a remote SSH based PSSession.",
