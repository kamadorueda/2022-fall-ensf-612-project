  "body": "The dotnet-core and aspnetcidev feeds provide all our required packages. The aspnetvnext causes `dotnet restore` to take an inordinate amount of time, which terminates our CI builds.\n\nReducing the number of feeds brings restore time from scratch down to 3 seconds on my machine.\n\nResolves #896.\n\nThe aspnetvnext feed was originally added for the CoreCLR xUnit runner packages; but is no longer necessary.\n",
