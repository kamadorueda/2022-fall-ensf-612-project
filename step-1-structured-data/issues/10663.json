  "body": "Consider the following cmdlet entry:\r\n\r\n`Get-AzSubscription | Where-Object -Property State -eq \"Enabled\" | Out-GridView -PassThru | Select-AzSubscription`\r\n\r\nWith `Out-GridView`, it's should very easy to graphically select which subscription object from the collection you wish to pass to `Select-AzSubscription`. The code works, but the UI needs to make it clear which row is selected.\r\n\r\nFor example, it's nearly impossible to tell which row is selected in this image: \r\n![ogvselection](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14332263/65975283-624e9a80-e43c-11e9-9af1-c204a5f90e30.png)\r\n(Sorry, I had to obscure the GUIDs and names.) But the point can still be seen: one of these objects is selected but it's almost impossible to tell.\r\n\r\nThe colors in the macOS `OGV` UI need adjusting to clearly delineate which object is selected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
