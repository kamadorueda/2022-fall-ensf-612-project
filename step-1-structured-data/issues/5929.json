Does nayone know?\r\n\r\n - With things like `Resolve-DnsName` in PowerShell 6 - after reading https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/whats-new/what-s-new-in-powershell-core-60?view=powershell-6#backwards-compatibility-with-windows-powershell, should I wait for the `DnsClient` and `NetTCPIP` module to be ported to Powershell 6?
