And it is all black, no output, no text, nothing. Its like the program gets stuck. You can only return to the terminal by exiting using ctrl + C.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nmacOS Catalina 10.15\r\ncan't supply more information, running `pwsh --version` gives me no output and the program just freezes.\r\n",

Only way for me to exit is to Ctrl + C.\r\n\r\nI installed the powershell plugin to Visual Studio Code and in the VSCode i get a working powershell terminal when starting up inside the program.
