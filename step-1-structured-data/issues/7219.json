  "body": "Recently tried to compile PowerShell native Windows binaries and this last copy operation:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d04fef469b774ffa63536ad460aff3708642999a/build.psm1#L307-L311\r\nof `Start-BuildNativeWindowsBinaries` failed due to absence of file in expected location.\r\n\r\nFor me file (result of compilation) was located in `\\src\\PowerShell.Core.Instrumentation` relative to repo root, but not in `$HOME\\source` as stated in the comment. Is that error here or location was changed or is dependent of environment? Should build script be fixed or enhanced to cover other location of build artifacts?",

I have to say though that I have never used this function before as I never needed it.\r\nI should add that when I first ran it, I had problems due to missing `atlbase.h` headers, which I could fix by installing the optional Visual Studio component `Visual C++ ATL support`",
