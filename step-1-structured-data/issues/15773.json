So I started it in another shell on the same computer and left it running ***before*** I started another shell and tried to `cd` into the wsl directories.  \r\n\r\nHowever, I just found out that I have to run `wsl` in the exact same shell session that I want to `cd` into the wsl directories.  After `exit`ing wsl back to PowerShell can I then successfully `cd` into the wsl directories from that session and only that session.  It does not matter how many other active wsl sessions are running on the same computer.\r\n",
