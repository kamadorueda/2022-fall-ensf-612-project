We make no guarantees for it working to actually build.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov has been doing good working getting rid of the workarounds we use in `start-psbuild`, but the team at Microsoft, we don't have an immediate goal to build using Visual Studio.  There is still one workaround, `TypeGen` which I haven't seen him attempt to eliminate.  \r\n\r\nAs far as why we don't restore everything, we know we can't cross compile, so we limit what we have dotnet restore to save time and disk.",
