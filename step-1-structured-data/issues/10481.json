  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInstalled PowerShell Core on a Windows 10 that did not come with it pre-installed.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nExpected normal typing (had to go back and erase the inserted `@`):\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6992464/64210767-7bcee780-ce7a-11e9-9704-4fca087ea346.png)\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhenever I try to `Shift + '` to add quotes, it first inserts an `@` and after pressing `Space` it inserts the actual `\"` quotemark. Also happens with single quotes, and any kind of accents like `~`, `^` and so on. If I try to type both quotes without pressing space, it'll give me both quotes and a single `@`. If I press space on the fist then try to type another quote, it'll give me another `@`.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6992464/64210786-8be6c700-ce7a-11e9-92ac-c46ceb9868e5.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6992464/64210861-bf295600-ce7a-11e9-8790-028e4966868a.png)\r\n\r\nI'm brazilian, and I'm on a US keyboard, using \"English International\" layout, to allow for accents. I also have oh-my-posh and posh-git installed, but I disabled both of them prior to these screenshots.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
