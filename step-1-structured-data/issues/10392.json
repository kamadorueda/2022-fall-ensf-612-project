  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n@PaulHigin : Since we have support for parallel pipeline execution in *ForEach-Object* cmdlet (BTW big thank you for that!), can we get *Where-Object* cmdlet on par too?\r\n\r\nAt the moment one has to use conditional statement inside of the *ForEach-Object* scriptblock to *emulate* the *Where-Object* behavior in order to get the benefits of parallel pipeline execution. I guess that the code would be much clearer if we could specify *Parallel* parameter with *Where-Object* cmdlet.\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n> Set-StrictMode -Off\r\n> $p = Get-Process\r\n> (Measure-Command {$p | Where-Object {($_.Modules.FileName | Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA512 -EA 0).Hash -match \"^A.*B$\"}}).TotalSeconds\r\n44.2352473\r\n> (Measure-Command {$p | ForEach-Object -Parallel {if(($_.Modules.FileName | Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA512 -EA 0).Hash -match \"^A.*B$\"){$_}}}).TotalSeconds\r\n12.1277177\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n",

      "body": "@kvprasoon: IMO it should follow the *ForEach-Object* implementation not only because of consistency but also to make sure that developers are specifying *Parallel* path consciously as it has some side effects that they need to be aware of (e.g. output of parallel pipeline execution may be out-of-order, so it needs to be taken that into account when writing code to make sure that there is no serial dependency on the output order).",
