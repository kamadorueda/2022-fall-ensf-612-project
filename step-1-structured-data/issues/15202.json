Not on the remote machine. If you disconnect the ssh connection the charset persist until you close the powershell and open a new one.\r\n\r\n![grafik](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11733097/114304431-5af95a00-9ad3-11eb-87a9-9194fff04bcd.png)\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\nPowershell is used with Windows Terminal 1.6.10571.0\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
