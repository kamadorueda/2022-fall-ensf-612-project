      "body": "@vinod-ps I have run into the exact same issue as you did, and it has nothing to do with PowerShell.\r\n\r\nIt's an issue with the terminal capabilities set by the Linux OS on which ESXi runs. There are few termcaps available in ESXi, and the environment negotiation of the SSH session fails in many cases.\r\n\r\nI have been having the same issue on MacOS terminal, and also on Putty on Windows 10.\r\n\r\nThe following command makes things work fine:\r\n\r\n`TERM=screen; dcui`\r\n\r\nOn terminals which support the Linux termcaps, this works better:\r\n\r\n`TERM=linux; dcui`\r\n\r\nPlease note that in order to exit the DCUI instance you have to use CTRL-C.\r\n\r\nAlso, if there are no Function keys on your keyboard or they do not get sent from the terminal software, you can use ESC + 2 for F2.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nBye, Luca",
