  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nCurrently there are two kinds of PowerShell nuget libraries available:\r\n\r\n1. The full library, for applications that host PowerShell (`Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK`)\r\n2. The reference library, for PowerShell modules (`PowerShellStandard.Library`)\r\n\r\nHowever, the reference library is currently bound to PS Standard, which means (as far as I can tell) it's essentially pinned at v5.1, and such a cmdlet or module isn't going to be able to access anything new in the PowerShell API from 6.x onwards into 7.0 and beyond.\r\n\r\nThis means that cmdlet authors either are forced to accept that they must stick with 5.1-level APIs regardless of anything new that comes out, or they must download the entire SDK and all its dependent packages (as though they were hosting PowerShell in a separate application) just to write a basic cmdlet.\r\n\r\nCan we please get a reference library release at least for V7 release, and possibly keep one up to date with the current PS release versions? \ud83d\ude0a ",
