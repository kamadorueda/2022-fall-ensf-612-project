Getting a large and unclear error message is really off-putting for new users, and my linked comment shows how an accepted answer on a Microsoft forum suggested _reinstalling Windows_ because of the error.\r\n\r\nThe default way people run `Update-Help` for the past few years is something similar to this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUpdate-Help -Verbose -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\r\n```\r\n\r\nDefault functionality shouldn't be to \"don't show me errors, just skip them,\" especially for new users, as it leads to bad practices and blind spots.\r\n\r\nOther places where I have engaged in discussion about this problem:\r\n- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39834452/powershell-fails-with-update\r\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerShell/comments/fcjkip/multiple_years_of_microsofts_broken_powershell/\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/stackoverflow/Img/apple-touch-icon@2.png?v=73d79a89bded\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div>Stack Overflow</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39834452/powershell-fails-with-update\">Powershell fails with Update</a></strong></div><div>When I run Update-Help it fails in Powershell.

There are several reasons this might occur such as a module no longer being supported, a mistake in the helpinfouri, or a team that are not currently using the updatable help pipeline. As teams choose to fix/not fix these issues, which would represent this the best in the output following update-help?\r\n> \r\n> I've viewed the error messages as the most proper indication of what has occurred - however several here have requested that we change these to warnings. If update-help can't locate a module to download, would you prefer to receive an error message or warning?\r\n\r\nI believe that the correct behavior should be errors in case modules became deprecated or urls die\r\n\r\nBUT\r\n\r\nAt least for me and for others I have seen that this issue bothers them, it's the fact that when using a fresh windows install- update-help returns errors.\r\n\r\nWhen a program I have just now started using screams at me \"error\" on first use I am suspicious if something is wrong with my setup.\r\n\r\nyet everyone is acting like this is ok.\r\n\r\nSomething needs to be fixed and it's not about the error message",

The modules that the PowerShell team has influence over, we have corrected, however, there will be some modules that are not possible to immediately repair.  These modules may or may not be Microsoft modules.  I think most folks here have agreed, that if a module fails to update, the user should be informed of the failure.  Would it help if the error message were reduced and error details could be discovered with Get-Error - essentially hiding the details unless desired?

The error messages would remain the same. This configurable list may initially ship with the modules that we know will not be updated in the future.  You can add additional modules if that is needed.  Would that be helpful?",

We think the block list may be a way to ship that knowledge so you don't have to troubleshoot.  As for additional problems with modules, is there a specific error message you've noticed not related to those mentioned in this issue?",
