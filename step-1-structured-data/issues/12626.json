The dotnet tool has an update command but not yet a command to update all installed tools. For a local dev environment, it's probably OK as a workaround but I wouldn't use this way for distributing it across machines due to the maintenance overhead. Ideally you only want to use 1-2 package managers and avoid using too many different package managers.",
