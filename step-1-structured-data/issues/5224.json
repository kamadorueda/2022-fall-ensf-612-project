  "body": "Update to Newtonsoft.Json >= 10.0.3 will fix this issue.  Unfortunately, even if a `PSCmdlet` references the newer version, the version of Newtonsoft.Json that ships with PowerShell 6.0 is loaded instead of the version referenced by the `PSCmdlet` library because PowerShell 6.0 owns the AppDomain and configuration.\r\n\r\nSee Azure/azure-powershell#4488 where this issue has been shown to affect Azure PowerShell Core.\r\nSee JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json#1294 where this was first shown to affect Concurrent Collections deserialization in Newtonsoft.Json for .NET Core 2.0.\r\nSee [Newtonsoft.10.0.3 release notes](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/tag/10.0.3) which identifies that the fix went into Newtonsoft.Json.10.0.3.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInstall-Module AzureRM.Netcore\r\nSave-AzureRmContext\r\nImport-AzureRMContext\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nDeserialization of a `ConcurrentDictionary` works in PowerShell 6.0.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIt does not.\r\n",
