  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nTo complement the proposal in #10999, as suggested by @vexx32:\r\n\r\n> I think we should also consider adding a switch to `ConvertFrom-Csv` and `Import-Csv` in order to import the data `-AsHashtable` for symmetry.\r\n\r\nNote: To be a viable alternative, the output objects should be  _ordered_ hashtables (`[ordered] @{}`, i.e. `System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary`), in order to preserve the input column order.\r\n\r\nThat said, note that the existing `ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable` feature actually outputs inherently unordered  `[hashtable]` instances.\r\n\r\nBenefits:\r\n\r\n* As with `ConvertFrom-Json -AsHashtable`, you may want output objects that are easier to manipulate in terms of subsequent removal / addition of properties (entries).\r\n\r\n* Ordered hashtable instances are more lightweight than `[pscustomobject]` instances and would enable (faster) processing of larger input datasets, in cases where [pscustomobject] output consumes inordinate amounts of memory - see #7603\r\n\r\n\r\n",
