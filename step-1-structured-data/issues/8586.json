Run some long-running task that you'll have time to Ctrl+C, but that will finish in a reasonable time. I used `ls ~\\Downloads`.\r\n1. Ctrl+C (once) before the command finishes. It won't work.\r\n1. When the command finishes, observe that the debugger is no longer attached. \r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nIt's expected that the command being executed from within the debugger will be killed, but that the debugger will not be killed and remain attached.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe command doesn't halt execution, and the debugger is unattached at the end of its execution.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0-preview.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0-preview.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18301\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
