      "body": "Good idea, @anthonyvdotbe.\r\n\r\n@iSazonov, the good thing is that those terminals that do _not_ support this feature degrade gracefully and simply ignore the link.\r\n\r\nHere's an overview of the support across terminal applications:\r\n\r\n* Windows:\r\n    * conhost.exe (legacy console windows): NO  - quietly ignores the link and prints just the link label\r\n    * Windows Terminal, as of at least v1.4.3243.0: YES - must Control-click to open the link. \r\n* Unix:\r\n    * macOS:\r\n        * Terminal.app: NO - quietly ignores the link and prints just the link label.\r\n        * iTerm2.app: YES - must Command-click to open the link.\r\n    * Linux:\r\n        * Gnome Terminal: YES - must Control-click to open the link.\r\n",
