It is not known how many or at what depth an `obj` directory might be found.\r\n\r\nThe only way I have found to omit the paths containing an `obj` directory is to filter it out with a `-like` pattern to run on all (current) PowerShell platforms. I find the pattern unattractive. The goal is to write PowerShell code that will run on all platforms without change.\r\n\r\nIs there a better way to accomplish this?\r\n```\r\nGet-ChildItem -Recurse |\r\n    Where-Object { -not ( $_.FullName -like \"*[/\\]obj[/\\]*\") } |\r\n    ForEach-Object { $_.FullName }\r\n```",
