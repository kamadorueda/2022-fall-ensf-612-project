  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nWe could consider https://github.com/TomaszRewak/C-sharp-console-gui-framework as output layer for PowerShell Core to get: \r\n- Coloring\r\n- Progress bar like Windows PowerShell on Unix-es\r\n- Alternatives graphical cmdlets like Show-Command and Show-GridView\r\n- clickable Help\r\n- and more, more, more\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI was very surprised to see that ConsoleGU size is very small.\r\nCurrently we have a console implementation internally in PowerShell Core so integration with ConsoleGU does not have to be complicated.\r\n\r\n/cc @SteveL-MSFT @daxian-dbw for information.",
