  "body": "### Background and Description\r\n\r\nI'm trying to run `Write-Error boomed` with `pwsh -EncodedCommand VwByAGkAdABlAC0ARQByAHIAbwByACAAYgBvAG8AbQBlAGQA`, and I'm expecting the following output: \r\n\r\n```\r\nWrite-Error: boomed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it works pretty well. However, running this command without pseudo-tty, will cause it to print some meaningless characters. I'm using `ssh -T localhost xxx` to run without tty, and `ssh -tt localhost xxx` to run with tty. And I'm getting the following test results: \r\n\r\n||with tty (-tt)|without tty (-T)|\r\n|---|---|---|\r\n|Windows powershell 5.1|good|messed up|\r\n|Linux powershell 7|good|messed up|\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun \r\n\r\n```bash\r\nssh -T localhost pwsh -EncodedCommand VwByAGkAdABlAC0ARQByAHIAbwByACAAYgBvAG8AbQBlAGQA\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected output in stderr\r\n\r\n```console\r\nWrite-Error: boomed\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual output in stderr\r\n\r\n```console\r\n#< CLIXML\r\n<Objs Version=\"1.1.0.1\" xmlns=\"http://schemas.microsoft.com/powershell/2004/04\"><S S=\"Error\">_x001B_[91mWrite-Error: _x001B_[91mboomed_x001B_[0m_x000A_</S></Objs>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Linux 5.15.10-hardened1-1-hardened #1 SMP PREEMPT Fri, 17 Dec 2021 20:16:31 +0000\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n# Note that this problem also exists in powershell 5.1 on Windows.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19610256/147651227-5b5c9820-7c36-4742-ad9c-20b98c249f53.png)\r\n\r\n### What have I tried\r\n\r\nI have tried setting `$WarningPreference = \"SilentlyContinue\"`. After setting this variable, I can run  `[Console]::Error.WriteLine('xxx')` with `pwsh -EncodedCommand` without any issue. But `Write-Error xxx` is still messing up the terminal. \r\n\r\n### Ref\r\n\r\n<https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/67964>\r\n\r\n<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51634308/start-process-using-encodedcommand-outputs-to-standard-error>",

Console is redirected as it's redirected by ssh.  No output format was specified and the command was encoded.  So I don't see a way to change this without breaking existing usage.",
