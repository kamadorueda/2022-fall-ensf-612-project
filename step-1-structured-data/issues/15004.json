  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSay I have a scriptblock like this:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n{\r\n    param(\r\n        $a,\r\n        $b\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    \"a: $a\"\r\n    \"b: $b\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd I want to invoke it from C#:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar sb = ScriptBlock.Create(\"...\");\r\nvar parameters = new Hashtable\r\n{\r\n    { \"a\", \"A\" },\r\n    { \"b\", \"B\" },\r\n};\r\n\r\nsb.Invoke(?);\r\nInvokeCommand.InvokeScript(sb, ?);\r\n\r\nusing (var pwsh = PowerShell.Create())\r\n{\r\n    pwsh.<?>.AddParameters(parameters).Invoke();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIs there a way to do this currently in PowerShell, and if not can we have one?\r\n\r\nThe best way I've found to do this so far is to use reflection to create a `FunctionInfo` object around the scriptblock for invocation:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\nvar sb = ScriptBlock.Create(\"param($a, $b) \\\"a: $a\\\",\\\"b: $b\\\"\");\r\nvar runspace = RunspaceFactory.CreateRunspace();\r\nrunspace.Open();\r\n\r\nPropertyInfo runspaceExecutionContextProperty = typeof(Runspace).GetProperty(\"ExecutionContext\", BindingFlags.Instance | BindingFlags.NonPublic);\r\nType ecType = runspaceExecutionContextProperty.PropertyType;\r\n\r\nConstructorInfo funcInfoCtor = typeof(FunctionInfo).GetConstructor(\r\n    BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance,\r\n    binder: null,\r\n    new[] { typeof(string), typeof(ScriptBlock), ecType },\r\n    modifiers: null);\r\n\r\nobject executionContext = runspaceExecutionContextProperty.GetValue(runspace);\r\nvar sbFuncInfo = (FunctionInfo)funcInfoCtor.Invoke(new object[] { string.Empty, sb, executionContext });\r\n\r\nusing (var pwsh = PowerShell.Create())\r\n{\r\n    pwsh.AddCommand(sbFuncInfo).AddParameters(new Dictionary<string, object>{ {\"a\", \"A\"}, {\"b\", \"B\"} });\r\n\r\n    foreach (PSObject result in pwsh.Invoke())\r\n    {\r\n        Console.WriteLine(result);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is very involved, messy, requires overhead and isn't public/officially supported.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nSome considerations:\r\n\r\n- While the `PowerShell` API is a good place for this, it doesn't currently have good support for scriptblocks (something which could be improved)\r\n- Other APIs do support scriptblocks well, such as `CommandInvocationIntrinsics.InvokeScript` and `ScriptBlock.Invoke[WithContext]` and it would be nice to extend those to enable named parameter passing since they allow simpler control of the execution context than the `PowerShell` API\r\n",

Note that since the script block's _content_ is being passed, there must _not_ be enclosing `{ ... }`\r\n\r\n* While there is currently no support for passing a _dictionary_ of arguments - i.e. no support for _splatting_ via the `PowerShell` class - a chain of `.AddParameter()` calls is akin to that, if more verbose.

Supporting `ScriptBlock` directly would imply to me that `SessionState`, extent data, runspace affinity, etc would be honored. In out of process runspaces, this overload would probably just `ToString`, for in-process-but-not-current-thread runspaces, affinity would likely result in dead locks or state corruption.\r\n\r\nAlso as you mentioned, it's common in PowerShell to rely on argument coercion here.  So if a new overload were added it would most likely need to be the same as `ToString()` to avoid changing behavior of existing scripts (which doesn't solve the use case in the OP).\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd like to see either:\r\n\r\n1. A public constructor on `ScriptInfo`. This is round about enough that you will likely already understand the caveats if you reach for this\r\n2. A static class following a similar pattern as the BCL's `Unsafe` and `MemoryMarshal` classes. This would make it abundantly clear that safety is the consumer's responsibility.  Something like: \r\n\r\n\t  ```csharp\r\n\t  namespace System.Management.Automation\r\n\t  {\r\n\t      public static class PSUnsafe // or CommandMarshal\r\n\t      {\r\n\t          public static ScriptInfo AsScriptInfo(ScriptBlock scriptBlock);\r\n\t          public static ScriptInfo AsScriptInfo(ScriptBlock scriptBlock, Runspace affinity);\r\n\t      }\r\n\t  }\r\n\t  ```",
