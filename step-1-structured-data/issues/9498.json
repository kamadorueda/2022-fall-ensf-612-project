I guess that it is because the Microsoft.IIS.Powershell.Commands.dll is not in GAC for the first trial.\r\n2.\tIf we delete the Microsoft.IIS.Powershell.Commands.dll in GAC, the issue is gone. \r\nThat means this issue happens because pwsh.exe loads Microsoft.IIS.Powershell.Commands.dll in GAC directory unexpectedly when it starts. \r\nYou can confirm that that with attaching the pwsh process right after it starts or simply running \u201ctlist -p <process id of pwsh>\u201d command and you will see the GAC directory path as the following:\r\nC:\\> tlist 6904 \r\n   6904 pwsh.exe\r\n   CWD:     C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\\r\n   CmdLine: pwsh\r\n\u2026\r\n10.0.18890.1001 sh  0x000001F99B180000  C:\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\assembly\\GAC_MSIL\\Microsoft.IIS.Powershell.Commands\\v4.0_10.0.0.0__31bf3856ad364e35\\Microsoft.IIS.PowerShell.Commands.dll\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
