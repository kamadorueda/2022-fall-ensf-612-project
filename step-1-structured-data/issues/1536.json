In emacs mode, you should get completion to the common prefix, in this case `Get-PSReadlineOption`\n2. There should be just one command from PSReadLine, not two\n## Actual behavior\n1. Doesn't complete the prefix\n2. There are two cmdlets with the same name\n## Environment data\n\nOS X\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\n> $PSVersionTable\nName                           Value                                                                                                        \n----                           -----                                                                                                        \nPSVersion                      5.1.10032.0                                                                                                  \nPSEdition                      PowerShellCore                                                                                               \nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                      \nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0                                                                                                      \nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.7-13-g0814942d8845a17860163b5db441ebd38590f4f9                                                  \nCLRVersion                                                                                                                                  \nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                          \nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                          \nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1    \n```\n",

I'm sure the tab completion engine is returning multiple results with identical \"list item\" values, but different replacements.\n\nIn this case, it's probably returning `Get-PSReadlineOption` and `PSReadline\\Get-PSReadlineOption` for the completions.\n\nAt any rate, this should be tracked at http://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine\n\nAnd completion isn't unusable with this issue, try Ctrl+Space, you can select one or the other.\n",
