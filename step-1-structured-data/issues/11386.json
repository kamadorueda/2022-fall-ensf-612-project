  "body": "Note: \r\n\r\n* `~` expansion for native utilities currently fundamentally only works on _Unix_ platforms - but Windows would benefit from it too:  see #10675\r\n\r\n* Fully emulating the logic of `~` expansion in PowerShell requires recognizing _partial_ quoting of sub-tokens in arguments (e.g., `~/'foo bar'`), which may turn out to be challenge based on how argument parsing currently works.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn a Unix-like platform:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Quoting the argument as a whole always suppresses ~ expansion.\r\n/bin/echo '~/foo' | Should -Be '~/foo'\r\n\r\n# Both commands should expand ~ to the value of $HOME, \r\n# because the ~/ prefix is unquoted.\r\n/bin/echo ~/foo | Should -Not -BeLike '~/*'\r\n/bin/echo ~/'foo bar' | Should -Not -BeLike '~/*'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests should succeed.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe 3rd test fails, because the partially quoted argument prevented `~` expansion - even though `~/` is _unquoted_.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected like wildcard '~*' to not match '~/foo bar', but it did match.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in POSIX-like shells - whose behavior here is being emulated - `/bin/echo ~/'foo bar'` indeed expands `~`, as expected.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-rc.1\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "It's also missing support ~username syntax; for example, if I have a user `foo` with a home directory of `/home/foo`, even if I'm currently running as user `bar`, `~foo/test` should expand to `/home/foo/test`.  I don't think it's too important to prioritize that feature, since it's not widely known, but I figured I'd mention it.",
