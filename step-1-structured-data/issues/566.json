  "body": "With the switch to `netstandardapp1.5` framework for the host, the xUnit test runner broke. For `dotnet test` to work with the .NET Core xUnit runner, it must continue to target `dnxcore50`. Fortunately, we can import our project's framework, and make everything work again.\n\nAlso improved the `xunit.sh` script to check for dependencies.\n\n/cc @zach-folwick This should unblock you.\n",
