  "body": "When you are working with a hierarchy of files where a lot of files have the same name, it's very easy to do the following mistake.\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to call `Get-Content` (aka `cat`) on them.\r\n\r\n```\r\nls -Recursive -Filter .gitignore | % {$_.FullName; cat $_}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis code is actually an equivalent to \r\n\r\n```\r\nls -Recursive -Filter .gitignore | % {$_.FullName; cat $_.Name}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd will output the same top-level `.gitignore` file again and again.\r\nThe way to fix it, would be changing to `$_ | cat` or `cat $_.FullName`.\r\n\r\nIt seems like one of the things that can introduce hard to spot bugs, but I don't know is it possible to improve without breaking existing scripts.",

      "body": "@iSazonov - an alias parameter would only help when binding via the pipeline.\r\n\r\nWe could add an argument transformation attribute though - that wouldn't change behavior anywhere it wasn't used.  The transformation would do nothing for strings, use `FullName` for FileInfo or DirectoryInfo instances, and I guess use whatever conversion we do today for everything else, probably calling `LanguagePrimitives.ConvertTo<string>` or something like that.",
