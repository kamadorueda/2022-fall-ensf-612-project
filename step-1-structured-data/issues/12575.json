The Cmdlet Working Group has already discussed a separate issue for creating a new eventlog, deciding not to pursue it, But I can see value in having commands like `Limit-WinEvent` and 'Clear-WinEvent`. Adding this to the Working Group review list.",

It would make sense to have a community module wrapping the .NET APIs to simplify their usage and discoverability but not something needed within PS7.  Also, users can use wevtutil from PowerShell today which exposes many of the capabilities being requested making this a low priority.",
