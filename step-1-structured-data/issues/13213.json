It would be great if you could advise us. For this example let us assume there are two modules Module A, Module B that provides different functionality but both Module A and Module B depends on some boiler plate code added in Module C (Common module). We can also assume that all Modules (Module A and Modules B) with version 0.1.0 will depend on Module C (Common Module) with the same version (0.1.0). We also intend to do periodic releases of all the modules. Now if an end user wants to do the following:\r\n1) Use Module A - 0.1.0 (depends on Module C - 0.1.0) and Module B 0.2.0 (depends on Module C 0.2.0) in the same Powershell session. If the user imports Module A in the session and then tries to import Module B. Pwsh complains \"assembly with the same name is already loaded\".   What can we possibly do let the user use different versions of Module A and module B in the same session?\r\n\r\n2. This question is not a real problem (as we could open a new PWSH session) but still we are trying to understand why it is happening. We also notice that if we do `Import-Module ModuleA -RequiredVersion 0.1.0` and `Remove-Module ModuleA` and later do  `Import-Module ModuleA -RequiredVersion 0.2.0`. Pwsh complains  the same error telling assemblies with the same name is already loaded. Is this because `Remove-Module` does not remove the loaded assemblies?  Is there a work around to load the latest version of the module in the same PWSH session after doing a `Remove-Module`? \r\n\r\n```\r\nModuleA.psd1 contents for version 0.X.0:\r\n\r\nRootModule = 'assemblies/ModuleA.dll'\r\n\r\n# Version number of this module.\r\nModuleVersion = '0.X.0'\r\n\r\nRequiredModules = @(@{ModuleName = \u2018ModuleC\u2019; GUID = \u2018xyz\u2019; RequiredVersion = '0.X.0'; })\r\n\r\n# Assemblies that must be loaded prior to importing this module\r\nRequiredAssemblies = 'assemblies/AnotherDependencyForModuleA.dll'\r\n```\r\n```\r\nModuleC.psd1 contents for version 0.X.0:\r\n# Script module or binary module file associated with this manifest.\r\nRootModule = 'assemblies/ModuleC.dll'\r\n\r\n# Version number of this module.\r\nModuleVersion = \u20180.X.0\u2019\r\n\r\n# Modules that must be imported into the global environment prior to importing this module\r\n# RequiredModules = @()\r\n\r\nRequiredAssemblies = 'assemblies/NLog.dll', \r\n               'assemblies/retrier.dll'\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

Perhaps, it would be great help if you can point to some documentation which addresses typical usage of PowerShell for the use cases mentioned above? i.e. as a PowerShell user, if I have an installed and imported module in a PowerShell session and I need to upgrade its version, is the only option to close this shell window and open a new one? How do veteran PowerShell users deal with use cases 1 and 2 mentioned above? (Would they already know to close the PowerShell session and open new PowerShell to deal with these use cases because this is considered \"normal behavior\" in PowerShell world?)

You can also install side by side, but you'll still need to open a new session before you can actually import the new version.\r\n\r\n> How do veteran PowerShell users deal with use cases #1\r\n\r\nFor dependencies, you have these options for the most part:\r\n\r\n1. Target and bundle the lowest version you can for each module.  When one module needs to target a later version, target it in all modules.  This only really works if you control the dependency and every dependent module\r\n1. Don't bundle the dependency with each module, put the dependency in it's own module, and require PowerShell to load the installed module instead of .NET.  Not a lot of folks do this one because PowerShellGet doesn't handle it well currently\r\n1. Put each module in it's own ALC, then it can load whatever it wants. Only choose this one if you fully understand how ALC's work.  They make it incredibly challenging for external binary modules to interact with your module\r\n\r\nHonestly most of us just don't take/make dependencies.\r\n\r\n> and #2 mentioned above? (Would they already know to close the PowerShell session and open new PowerShell to deal with these use cases because this is considered \"normal behavior\" in PowerShell world?)\r\n\r\nYeah it's pretty commonly hit limitation.  Most veteran users will already have ran into it.  Those that don't, just let them know they need to update prior to importing.",

Most assemblies are backwards compatible, the problem is when you have already loaded `0.1.0` but specifically reference `0.2.0`, because then there is probably an API that you need that isn't there.\r\n\r\nNote that none of this really has much to do with PowerShell specifically, these are .NET rules.

      "body": "> Oh! So PWSH doesn't actually load the older version of the assembly and just relies on the backward compatibility of the assembly to work correctly?\r\n\r\nYeah, more specifically that's how .NET's assembly resolution works.  PowerShell doesn't really have a hand in it afaik.\r\n\r\nIt's not perfect, it's possible for minor versions to have breaking changes like changing a method overload or something.  In those cases it'll throw a JIT time exception which is very hard for the consumer to pin down. So if you own the dependency, try very hard to keep binary compatibility.\r\n\r\n> Looking at all the answers loading dependent assemblies into an isolated ALC seems to be next step forward for our use case.\r\n\r\nMake sure to read through the linked issues and be sure that you understand the challenges it presents.  Once you have it up and running make sure any type you return is either from the global ALC, or is not accepted by any other API.  For example don't isolate newtsonsoft and then emit a `JObject` to the pipeline because it's type identity will not match the type identity that other assemblies expect.\r\n\r\nRight now the only time I would personally recommend this approach is if your module is intended to be loaded into an environment where it's presence should be mostly invisible.  For example, the module that the `vscode-powershell` extension loads must have as little impact on the process as possible or it's value diminishes (like if a script breaks purely because of the editor you're testing it in, that's problematic).  That's significantly less true for most projects.\r\n",
