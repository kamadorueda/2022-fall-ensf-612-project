  "body": "In PowerShell 4.0, when your executing user did not have access to the default path for the Module Analysis Cache, it would continue execution (but without the cache?). \n\nIn PowerShell 5.0, you simply get an error that the cmdlets cannot be found.\n\nI see with WMF5.1, you have the ability to define or disable the cache location, but I assume it would still fail if you define the location but don't have access to it?\n\nhttps://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/wmf/5.1/scenarios-features\n## Steps to reproduce\n1.

      "body": "The analysis cache was rewritten completely, so I wouldn't assume anything about 5.1.\n\nWriting the cache happens in the background long after a command was found, see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/AnalysisCache.cs#L624\n\nAnd reading the cache is extremely tolerant of failures as well, see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/Modules/AnalysisCache.cs#L982\n\nI know I tested with the location `nul` and everything worked fine, so it's worth testing 5.1 to verify that it really does work correctly now.\n",

Disabling module auto discovery can help, but that breaks a ton of real worlds scripts and modules, so it would only be viable for you in a constrained scenario where you can fix everything that is broken.\n\nIt sounds like 5.1 resolves your issue though, so I'm closing.\n",
