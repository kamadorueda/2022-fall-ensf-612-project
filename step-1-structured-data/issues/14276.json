  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nUpdating my Blazor App to .net 5 broke PowerShell's ability to start remote sessions. I have included a vanilla Blazor app that reproduces the error. I was able to reproduce this error using any version of the PowerShell.SDK nuget package. I was unable to reproduce the error if I created a console app.\r\n\r\n[Sample App](https://github.com/tylerforaie/powerShellBlazor)\r\n\r\nIn the sample app there are 3 variables that need to be updated in the PowerShellService.cs file\r\n\r\n```none\r\ncomputerName - remote computer to connect to\r\nuserName - username to access remote computer\r\npassword - password of user\r\n```\r\nThe sample app calls Invoke-Command and runs Get-Process on the remote computer.\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell command to be run on remote computer\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell.Streams.Error logs \"An error has occurred which PowerShell cannot handle. A remote session might have ended.\" \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nUsing PowerShell.SDK 7.1.0 nuget package\r\n\r\n$PSVersionTable Output:\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
