I think we can start by taking care of all the issues [labeled test](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atest).\n\nWhen those are done, we can move on to automating full PowerShell on Linux end-to-end testing.\n\nNote that we also have the Windows PowerShell tests, that are in the process of being ported. @vors can you add any relevant information for that here?\n",
