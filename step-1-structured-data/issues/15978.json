Formatting engine need to know  VT100 codes and discard them at need, when host can't understand them leaving data as it is. Some codes like `e[2J Clear-Terminal (at 80's Univac paper terminals did a form feed and discard any pending data - video terminals emulate that in good and bad), but many others don't on legacy host on Windows.",
