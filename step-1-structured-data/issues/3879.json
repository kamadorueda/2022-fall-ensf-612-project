      "body": "`break` and `continue` work dynamically - meaning the `break`/`continue` statement searches for an appropriate loop to break from at runtime.  For example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction foo {\r\n    break outer # No loop in this function!\r\n}\r\n:outer foreach ($i in 1..100) {\r\n    $i\r\n    foreach ($j in 100..1000) {\r\n        foo\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will output a single number, breaking out of the outer loop.\r\n\r\nThe unfortunate thing is that `break` sort of works as people expect with `ForEach-Object`, but in my opinion, it's sort of an accident that falls out from the implementation.\r\n\r\nUnder the covers, the `break` turns into an exception (always V2 or earlier, V3 onwards if not lexically within a loop statement), the exception is always silent (because you don't really want to think of `break` as an exception, so it's silent even if we don't find a matching loop.",

So sometimes stepping back and \"saying the same thing differently\" can help expedite. \r\n\r\n@(\"1\",\"2\",\"3\") | ?{$_ -notmatch \"2\"} | out-host\r\n\r\nThis outputs 1 and 3 as expected (in response to the original \"questioned\" construct); and in this case, -ne works as well if preferred over the Regex equivalent shown in the example. \r\n",

      "body": "Is it worth discussing whether behaviour of keywords like `continue` and `break` should be scope-restricted? After all, currently they literally _cannot_ be handled whatsoever as several folks here have stated. \r\n\r\nThis is... unsettling, that calling a function from a module you've just downloaded could conceivably halt all running scripts right up to the global level, with _no possible way_ of being able to account for it. This is what actual terminating errors are _for_ in PowerShell, and we're (sensibly) given ways to handle them appropriately. \r\n\r\n`break` and `continue` are the exception (badum/tss) here, and I don't think it's in a good way. Wouldn't it make a _lot_ more sense for it to simply terminate the parent script block, function, or script -- but only the immediate level of execution? Searching beyond the parent function, script block, or script for something to break seems rife for exploitability and just generally breaking an awful lot of code that would and should otherwise be perfectly capable of handling similar terminating errors. \ud83d\ude26 ",
