To find the commands with unapproved verbs, run the Import-Module command again with the Verbose parameter. For a list of approved verbs, type Get-Verb.\n\nThis is due to `Create` not being an approved verb.\n\nI think `New` would be appropriate:\n\n``` powershell\n> Get-Verb | Select-String new                                                                                                            \n\n@{Verb=New; Group=Common}\n```\n",
