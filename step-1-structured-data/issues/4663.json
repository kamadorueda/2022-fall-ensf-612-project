      "body": "Sounds like a random sporadic failure that is not specific to this test.   Running this test on non-Windows systems as well has no value but it should still not fail on non-\r\nWindows systems(because it does not call any Windows specific API) which indicates that there is a different bug in PowerShell itself. The test simply checks that the content of an Xml file contains a certain download link and that this link is not dead. The tag 'Scenario' was chosen because those tests do not need to be part of CI, so maybe a different tag would  be better?",
