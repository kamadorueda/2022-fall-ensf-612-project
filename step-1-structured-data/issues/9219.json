In case of using PowerShell version 5.1, proxy settings can be done as below.\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n$proxyUrl = 'proxy URL'\r\n$proxyId = 'proxy user ID'\r\n$proxyPwd = 'proxy password'\r\n\r\n$password = ConvertTo-SecureString $proxyPwd -AsPlainText -Force\r\n$cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $proxyId, $password\r\n$proxy = New-Object System.Net.WebProxy $proxyUrl\r\n$proxy.Credentials = $cred\r\n[System.Net.WebRequest]::DefaultWebProxy = $proxy\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn terms of PowerShell 6.0, I would like to use proxy as well, but cannot use the command let above with proxy error.\r\nI would like to ask you how to connect with \u201cConnect-AzAccount\u201d using proxy server and PowerShell 6.0.\r\n",

You need to upgrade to PowerShell 6.1.3 for support.\r\n\r\nYou would need to contact the team that supports `Connect-AzAccount` .  How to configure the proxy is going to vary based on how they implemented the cmdlet.  I believe you can file an issue at https://github.com/Azure/azure-powershell for the `Az` Module.",
