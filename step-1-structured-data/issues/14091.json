  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n- Install Powershell 7 and have it add the context menus to open PowerShell at the current location\r\n- Open Windows Explorer and go to a directory other than your Env::USERPROFILE (say c:\\temp)\r\n- Use the PowerShell7 > Open Here or Open Here as Administrator options\r\n- Powershell starts up at Env:USERPROFILE\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n- Powershell should start up in the directory where the context menu was used (such as c:\\temp)\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n- Powershell always starts at Env::USERPROFILE\r\n\r\n## Fix\r\n\r\nThe problem here is that the registry command sets the WorkingDirectory, but that is not the same as the directory where the shell is opened to. You also need to do a Set-Location.\r\n\r\nThis is the command as laid down by WIX in Product.wxs\r\n\r\nC:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe -NoExit -RemoveWorkingDirectoryTrailingCharacter -WorkingDirectory \"%V!\" -Command \"$host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = 'PowerShell 7 (x64)'\"\r\n\r\nThis is a command that actually works:\r\n\r\n[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\\Directory\\ContextMenus\\PowerShell7x64\\shell\\openpwsh\\command]\r\n@=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\PowerShell\\\\7\\\\pwsh.exe -NoExit -RemoveWorkingDirectoryTrailingCharacter -WorkingDirectory \\\"%V!\\\" -Command \\\"$host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = 'PowerShell 7 (x64)'; $wdtemp=[Environment]::CurrentDirectory; Set-Location -Path $wdtemp\\\"\"\r\n\r\nAs noted above, you need to do a Set-Location to get the shell to open in the desired directory. This is complicated by the issue that -RemoveWorkingDirectoryTrailingCharacter was designed to fix, but that switch does not work with Set-Location. The solution was to set the -WorkingDirectory with -RemoveWorkingDirectoryTrailingCharacter (which sets [Environment]::CurrentDirectory properly), then read that into a variable and pass that to Set-Location.\r\n\r\nSince this is a strange sequence of commands and there might be a better way to do it, I'm leaving the final fix to the experts, but this does produce the desired behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17134\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
