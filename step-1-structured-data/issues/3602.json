  "body": "36 web cmdlet tests are failing in the nightly run because of a breaking change in `HttpClient` in `netcoreapp2.0`.\r\nIn `netcoreapp1.1`, `HttpClient` automatically sends header `\"Accept-Encoding\": \"gzip, deflate\"` in the request, and automatically decompress 'gzip/deflate' content from the response.\r\nHowever, with `netcoreapp2.0`, `HttpClient` doesn't send the header and stop automatically decompressing 'gzip/deflate' content.\r\nhttps://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/18646 was filed for this.\r\n\r\nThis PR also include a simple fix to `Get-Member`, so that `Get-Member -Input $null` errors out with the correct error message.",
