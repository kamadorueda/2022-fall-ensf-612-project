      "body": "@PeterWhittaker:\r\n\r\nI don't think you should expect the behavior you're describing, and I don't see the actual behavior you're describing on macOS, at least not on PowerShell Core v6.1.0-preview.3 (see what you get with my code at the bottom).\r\n\r\nAs for your expectations:\r\n\r\n`. ./afile` would only _execute_ something if there's either an extension-less _but executable_ `aFile` in the current dir, or a (not-required-to-be-executable) `afile.ps1` file, with the former taking precedence if both are present; if the file exists, but is neither executable nor has extension `.ps1`, it is opened as if it were a _document_.\r\n\r\n`. <filename>` with `<filename>` being a mere name (no path component) by (security-minded) design only ever looks for a file of that name in the directories listed in `$env:PATH` (see below), not in the _current_ directory.\r\n\r\n(As an aside: The syntax of`Write-Host(\"Hello\")` suggests a misconception; as a command, you shouldn't invoke `Write-Host` with _method_ syntax (parentheses around argument list, `,`-separated  arguments); use _argument_ syntax (command-line syntax) instead: `Write-Host \"Hello\"` (no parantheses, whitespace-separated arguments), or, if something should just display in the terminal by default, `\"Hello\"` - no explicit output command needed, unless you specifically want to bypass PowerShell's success output stream.)\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nSome background:\r\n\r\nIt is true that on Unix-like platforms the filename extension is irrelevant with respect to whether a file is _executable_, but in order to execute a file you must specify its _exact_ filename, so if it happens to have an extension (which is rare, but (unfortunately) does happen with `.sh` used for shell scripts), it _must_ be specified.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in a POSIX-like shell (such as `bash`), if the script name is `afile.sh`, you can _not_  invoke it with `./afile` or `. ./afile` (in the current directory).\r\n\r\nThis is where PowerShell's behavior differs: it _does_ implicitly look for its _own_ scripts and, if no `afile` - without extension is present - looks for `afile.ps1` and executes that, _in-process_ and - if `.\u00a0` was used - in the current scope.\r\n(As in POSIX-like shells, the script file need not have the executable permission bit(s) set in that case.)\r\n\r\nThat you must use `./` in order to target `afile` / `afile.ps1` _in the current dir._ (as opposed to finding a file of that name somewhere in `$env:PATH`) - whether with direct invocation or via \"dot-sourcing\" (`. \u00a0`) or via `&` - is a sensible security measure that is actually [mandated by POSIX](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#dot), and `bash` happens to be in violation of it (though it does look in `$env:PATH` _first_).\r\n\r\nAn additional difference is that in PowerShell you can invoke _anything_ with `.`, not just PowerShell _scripts_ (whereas POSIX-like shells invariably interpret the filename operand as a _script written in that shell's language_ and choke on binaries, for instance); if the operand happens not to be a PowerShell script, `.` behaves as if you had invoked the operand directly (or as if you had used `&` - the distinction between `&` and `.` only matters for (in-process) PowerShell code)).\r\n\r\nI don't see any problems with these selective differences between PowerShell and POSIX-like shells - they strike me as useful extensions.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\nLet me give examples that you can run as-is:\r\n\r\nSetup:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create extension-less script with shebang line and make it executable.\r\n\"#!/usr/bin/env pwsh`n'hi from out-of-process t'\" > t; chmod a+x t\r\n# Create a regular *.ps1 file\r\n'\"hi from in-process t.ps1\"' > t.ps1\r\n# Create text file.\r\n'foo' > t.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nTests:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Invoke by name \"t\" only; this should invoke the extension-less, executable file with the shebang line\r\nPS> . ./t\r\nhi from out-of-process t\r\n\r\n# Invoke with exact file name.\r\n# Note that if you were to delete \"t\" (the executable file with the shebang line), \r\n# then . ./t would be sufficient to target \"t.ps1\"\r\nPS> . ./t.ps1\r\nhi from in-process t\r\n\r\n# Invoke a document (something that is neither executable nor has extension .ps1)\r\n# Equivalent of: Invoke-Item t.txt\r\n# Note that Invoke-Item does *not* require the ./ prefix to target a file in the current dir., \r\n# because *opening* documents is not a security risk, but it's fair for .  and &  - whose main\r\n# purpose is *execution* - to require it.\r\nPS> . ./t.txt\r\n# opens t.txt in the default text editor.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": " > `PS > . ./fred`\r\n\r\nAs stated, given that the file neither has extension `.ps1` nor is marked as executable, it is treated as a _document_, as if you had run `Invoke-Item ./fred` or, using the native `open` macOS utility, `open ./fred`.\r\n\r\nWhat that does specifically depends on what default programs you've set up; on my machine, for instance, it opens the file in Visual Studio Code.\r\nIt's unclear what you mean by \"opens a new window\", but I suspect that the file is opened in TextEdit.app, the macOS default text editor (check the menu bar while the window is up).\r\n\r\nGiven the extended mandate of `.` in PowerShell - the ability  to invoke _anything_ - it makes sense to reserve the assumption that the target file contains PowerShell source code to be sourced to _files with extension `.ps1` only_.\r\n\r\nYou could argue that this extended mandate should be revoked and that `.` should _only_ support sourcing PowerShell source code, and - like POSIX-like shells, analogously - should _blindly assume_ that whatever file argument is passed contains PowerShell sourced that should be \"dot-sourced\", whereas currently this assumption is currently reserved solely for file arguments _with extension `.ps1`_. Consider this, however:\r\n\r\n* Changing the behavior of `.` would be a breaking change.\r\n\r\n*  It's unlikely that you'll want to create _extension-less_ PowerShell source-code files _for the purpose of \"dot-sourcing\"_; instead, extension-less PowerShell source-code files are most likely _executable scripts with a shebang line_, which are designed to run _out-of-process_, which contradicts the purpose of \"dot-sourcing\".\r\n\r\n> `PS > chmod +x fred`\r\n> `PS > . ./fred`\r\n\r\nNow the file is executable, so an _attempt_ is made to _execute_ it (but _not_ to \"dot-source\" it, because it lacks extension `.ps1`).\r\n_Presumably_ (someone familiar with the code should correct me, if necessary), PowerShell delegates execution to the _system_, which _fails_ in this case, because the plain-text file that is marked as executable _lacks a shebang line_ that specifies the interpreter to pass the file to.\r\n\r\nThat said, it shouldn't fail _quietly_, so that is worth creating a separate issue for.\r\n\r\n> `PS > mv ./fred ./fred.ps1 # fred.ps1 still executable`\r\n> `Hello`\r\n> `# as expected, at last`\r\n> `PS > chmod -x fred.ps1`\r\n> `PS > . ./fred.ps1`\r\n> `Hello`\r\n\r\nAs stated, `.ps1` files are special in PowerShell: you can invoke or \"dot-source\" them at will, whether they're executable files or not.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAs for your `sh` commands:\r\n\r\nYes, as stated, POSIX-like shells _blindly_ assume that files you pass to `.` contain code in _their_ shell language - PowerShell deviates from that (see above). Also note that POSIX-like shells have no \"native\" filename extension, so they - unlike PowerShell with its `.ps1` -  _cannot_ infer from a given filename whether it contains shell code or not (the ill-advised, unofficial, non-shell-specific `.sh` convention notwithstanding).\r\n\r\n`bash`, as stated, _in violation of POSIX_, allows you to do `. fred` without needing to refer to a file in the current directory with prefix `./` - this is _not_ worth supporting in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nFor _direct_ invocation, POSIX-like shells also have a _fallback mechanism_, if delegating to the system to invoke an _executable_ file fails due to _absence of a shebang line_. They default to executing such a file as either _themselves_ or with `/bin/sh`.\r\n\r\nThat strikes me as another practice that is _not_ worth adopting in PowerShell: reporting an error seems more sensible to me - as noted, PowerShell currently fails _silently_, which should be fixed.\r\n",
