  "body": "In my project, we are using .net framework 4.6,2 and want to call powershell from our c# code. When i went to nuget to install the required library (System.Management.Automation), i could see that 6.x.x onward versions are available and all support .net core and not .net framework.\r\n\r\nmy ask is how should i use or call powershell in my application as i cant upgrade it to .net core. It is a legacy application. I could manage to find one \"Install-Package System.Management.Automation.dll -Version 10.0.10586\" whicb alteast let me use PS but that is a deprecated one.\r\n\r\nPlease suggest how can i get old versions of above library from nuget for .net framework as that is blocking my work currently as we are short of time now.",
