  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n* `ConvertFrom-Json`'s behavior was changed in v7.0 so as not to contravene the fundamental expectation that arrays are _enumerated_ in the pipeline - even though that change constituted a breaking one. A `-NoEnumerate` switch was added as an opt-in to the old, non-enumerating behavior (array being sent as a whole, as a _single object_ through the pipeline).\r\n  * For the original discussion, see #3424.\r\n\r\n* By contrast, `Invoke-RestMethod`, which has `ConvertFrom-Json` built in, in a manner of speaking, still exhibits the old, non-enumerating behavior, which leads to surprising behavior, especially with `ForEach-Object` and `Where-Object` - see #15272, for example.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I suggest we change `Invoke-RestMethod` to follow `ConvertFrom-Json`'s new behavior:\r\n\r\n* Array-valued results should be _enumerated by default_.\r\n\r\n* A new `-NoEnumerate` switch would provide an opt-in to the old, non-enumerating behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
