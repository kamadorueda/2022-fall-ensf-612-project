  "body": "According to @andschwa, xUnit packages do not allow us to set the default AssemblyLoadContext (see #850 ). So xUnit tests are running on core powershell without PS-ALC being its default ALC.\n\nThis basically means the xUnit tests are running in a different environment than the one we are going to present to users, and it could mean that the tests results are not accurately reflecting the truth.\n\nThis is a broader test infrastructure issue and we need to fix it.\n",
