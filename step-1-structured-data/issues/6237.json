      "body": "Hmmm if we went this way, we would need to wrap all of the calls to github and not just this one.\r\nI think It is fairly safe to use my PR (#6236) instead. That just enables TLS 1.2 in addition to the current settings and then it will stick for at least the current session. \r\n\r\nIt's not clean, but we just have too many github calls for various build tools and actions. So we can safely treat enabling TLS 1.2 as a bootstrap requirement.",
