  "body": "This updates the bootstrap and download user experience, where `download.sh` installs PowerShell on both Ubuntu and OS X, and then our build module provides `Start-PSBootstrap` to install the build dependencies on every platform (Ubuntu, OS X, and Windows). `Start-PSBuild` now also handles more build tool path magic. Two PSRP scripts were removed too.\n\nThis also sets up support for running our continuous integration on OS X. However, as noted in dotnet/corefx#7731, .NET Core does not currently provide 10.9 packages, thus resulting in an unavoidable build failure.\n\nCommit efb32f9e4113dea78837817f5686553b6d9d6e03 disables the OS X build, and reverting it will re-enable it.\n\nI suggest we merge this now, and re-enable when supported.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/843)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
