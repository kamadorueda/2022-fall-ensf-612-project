  "body": "When the Pester tests were invoked over PSRP and the environment was\nmore pristine than a local client, the lack of a \"foo\" variable in some\nscope caused the Pester test suite to emit an error at the end, failing\nthe PSRP build.\n\nRemoving the Clear-Variable directive eliminates this error, and is not\nnecessary for the Pester test itself.\n\n/cc @paulcallen @JamesWTruher\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/881)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
