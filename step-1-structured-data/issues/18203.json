      "body": "That should work  - I haven't tested it. \r\n\r\nWhen ConvertTo-JSON receives multiple objects it makes them an array so  a multi-element array become and an array again, but it can't tell if a single item started life in array.  This does create some inconsistencies, and if what you're outputting is an array which might have zero, one or many elements, it's a pain. ",
