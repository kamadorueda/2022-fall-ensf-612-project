Having powershell available on both platforms would allow a unified approach to managing them.\r\n\r\nThis idea was already mentioned on UserVoice a while ago, but it hasn't gained much reach. So I am not aware of how many users would find this beneficial.\r\n\r\nHere is a link:\r\nhttps://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell/suggestions/33127174-powershell-core-on-ibm-power-series-hardware\r\n",
