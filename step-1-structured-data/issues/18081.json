For the modules I can't quite recall how to rule that one out.\r\n\r\nYeah, I considered about those possibilities. I tired delete all modules or $env:PSModulePath='', and $env:path='',  nothing changes.\r\nLet me describe more specifically:\r\nI have freshly installed powershell 7.2.6 from microsofte store, microsoft docs msi installer or this github releases, and even powershell 7.3 from microsoft store.  \r\nAll of them behave as the issuse title said, while my powershell 1.0, cmd and ubuntu wsl shell works as fast as expected.\r\n\r\nI have also checked my .net framework update.\r\n\r\nI made a virtual machine in this 'powershell problem computer' and tried powershell 7, it is also as fast as expected. So It can't be hardware problem.",
