One would think this should open the version-specific version of the documentation.  Not only has this caused issues for me, but I've also had experience where Microsoft support personnel were quoting from the wrong version of documentation because they didn't realize what was happening.\r\n",

Somecmdlet reference has been updated for PSv7 but only if a) the code PR for the change was merged in the PowerShell source repo, and b) somebody wrote the doc updates. The PSv7 content is considered to be **preview** content.\r\n\r\nFor PSv6 and PSv7, I created all new FWLinks to point to the correct online content. You have to download the latest help files to get those links. However, I don't think we are building and hosting updateable help CABs for PSv7 yet. So if you try `Update-Help` in PSv7 you probably get PSv6 content. Publishing PSv7 CABs will get turned on for the GA release.\r\n\r\nI did not fix any FWLink problems for PS5.1 and below since we are not publishing updated CABs at this time. There several MS-internal technical and procedural issues we have to solve to publish new CABs for PS5.1 and below.\r\n\r\nOne way to get updated help for any version is to build the CAB files yourself from the markdown source using PlatyPS and then install them from a local folder. This would be similar to the `Save-Help`/`Update-Help` scenario.",
