  "body": "Right now it appears that [Python has an advantage](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-the-windows-10-may-2019-update/) over PowerShell (Core) because:\r\n\r\n- Python is published to Windows Store\r\n- You can open deep link to the store natively by typing \"python\" in cmd\r\n\r\nPowerShell (Core) currently has neither of these benefits. This is upsetting\u2014especially if we want to eventually displace Windows PowerShell with it.\r\n\r\nPublishing to Windows Store would also aid frequent automatic updates, which is important for the Betas, I suppose.",
