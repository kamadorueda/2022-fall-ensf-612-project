Some of us think that rather than lashing on some un-powershelly stuff from C#, it would be better to say \"Just use and If or if ... else. At least it can be justfified with the idea that people think what works in one .NET langauge should carry over to another; inventing new ones cannot. \r\n",

I don't think there's a lot of value there. You can already use the ternary operator for this kind of purpose if you really want to:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$value = [string]::IsNullOrEmpty($var) ? $valueIfEmpty : $otherValue\r\n\r\n# shorthand relying on standard PS conversion paths\r\n$value = $var ? $valueIfEmpty : $otherValue\r\n```",
