      "body": "Hi @sashah363 It's actually the examples in the documentation that are problematic. `Write-Host -NoNewLine` works properly as @iSazonov  demonstrates with his examples. What you are seeing is that, after a command is run, the console host fixes the cursor position before emitting the prompt (which is exactly what it should do.)  You can see the code at [ConsoleHost.cs:2417](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ConsoleHost.cs#L2417). I suspect the doc examples date back quite a ways when we were less sophisticated in our handling of prompts.",
