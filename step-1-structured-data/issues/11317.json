I haven't had time to properly round it out, but the majority of the code is in place.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that really needs to be thoroughly re-done in there is the actual formatting I added to the ErrorRecord format views; that will need to be re-written completely since Steve added ConciseView in there.\r\n\r\nIf you want to pick that up & dust it off, fixing that up shouldn't be a huge work item on the whole. It will need to be reviewed from an API standpoint, though, as that implementation actually adds a new `Suggestion` member to `ErrorRecord` itself.",
