      "body": "In arithmetic operations, PowerShell converts the operands to the most accurate type. So the type of the operation `1 % 0.2` is `[double]` and the type of `[decimal] 1 % 2` (which could more easily be written as `1d % 0.2`) is `[decimal]`. Once the type is established, PowerShell uses the underlying .NET framework APIs to perform the operation e.g. [System.Decimal.Modulus](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.decimal.op_modulus?view=netframework-4.7.1#System_Decimal_op_Modulus_System_Decimal_System_Decimal_).
