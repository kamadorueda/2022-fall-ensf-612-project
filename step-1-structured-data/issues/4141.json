  "body": "@iSazonov @lzybkr\r\n\r\nAs a followup to #4075\r\n\r\nThe next issue while remote use of Powershell seems to be calculating the wrong locations to move cursors on wrap around:\r\n\r\nI recorded a video showing split console with one showing the visual usage of powershell and the other one of a log file dumped \r\n\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2LBAzFDsCk\r\n\r\nYou can see: when I execute a command that would exceed the current screen, it fails to scroll and \"wraps\". Once its wrapped, it begins to start jumping the cursor around. In fact, hitting Enter on empty line stops creating blank prompts altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe log file was a quick hack in `WriteBufferLines`\r\n```\r\n            System.IO.File.AppendAllText(@\"/home/mroszko/pstest/PowerShell/test.log\", String.Format(\"top:{0},blc:{1},$\r\n            if ((top + bufferLineCount) > Console.BufferHeight)\r\n            {\r\n                var scrollCount = (top + bufferLineCount) - Console.BufferHeight;\r\n                ScrollBuffer(scrollCount);\r\n                top -= scrollCount;\r\n\r\n                System.IO.File.AppendAllText(@\"/home/mroszko/pstest/PowerShell/test.log\", String.Format(\"scrolling:{0$\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nI started the video by executing \"clear\" before \r\n\r\nYou can see the strange wrap around it does in the video with top as I type in the log output and visually. \r\n\r\nI don't think the  ScrollBuffer() is quite implemented correct.",
