Because the object is probably a reference, it could be that this would still work, if the only thing being prevented is overwriting the variable itself (with a value type or a new reference).\r\n\r\nBut the other use I have in mind is, I think, legitimate.\r\n\r\nIf you want to have a function that takes a scriptblock parameter and then executes it against a series of items within your function, you have only a few choices:\r\n\r\n1. Don't support `$_`. This sucks for the caller. In PowerShell, you're used to writing such scriptblocks where `$_` represents the current item. Not being able to do also means you can't easily store and re-use such a scriptblock. So this ends up with \"custom\" code being non-idiomatic.\r\n1. Set the variable in your function before executing the scriptblock (that is do something like `$_ = $CurrentItem ; & $UserSuppliedScriptBlock`). This wouldn't work anymore.\r\n1. \"Fake it\" with `ForEach-Object`. I've done this before, mostly for prototyping, but it feels wrong. Basically, in your own function, you do something like this: `$CurrentItem | % -Process $UserSuppliedScriptBlock`. This does work... until `$CurrentItem` is an array and needs to be treated as such. There are other situations I don't remember offhand where this is problematic. I'd prefer that we didn't have to resort to this to support the same workflow that lots of other things in PowerShell do.",

Before that, there was no good way to find all references to variables that the PowerShell engine cared about in some way. It's also probably missing some that I missed or were added when I wasn't looking.",

      "body": "@lzybkr I was also thinking about splitting the warnings into 2 categories:\r\n- definitely avoid/cannot assign for variables such as e.g. `$false` where PowerShell itself would throw an error -> severity error\r\n- re-consider assignment for variables such as `$PSItem` -> severity warning\r\n\r\nThanks for the info. Version should be more than enough since v2 is already deprecated and PSSA requires at least v3 as far as I know. For starters, I could start at least with the official list [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_automatic_variables?view=powershell-5.1), which should be the most useful anyway. Some of them like `$IsWindows` cannot be put into it yet since PSSA is not aware of PowerShell Core yet as far as I know.",
