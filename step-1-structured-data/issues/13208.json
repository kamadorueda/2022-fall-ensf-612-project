  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCompare-object seems to sort both arrays before comparing them, usually as strings.  But the sort algorithm seems very slow.  Pre-sorting both arrays with sort-object is much faster.  Even without pre-sorting, these two arrays are considered equal by compare-object.\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\nOk, so maybe compare-object doesn't sort the two files, but by default matches every line in one file with every line in the other file, unless setting the -syncwindow?  If anything, this shows how confusing this command is, and how slow it can be with big files.  I've seen people assume that every object property is compared by default.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$a1 = 1..45kb\r\n$a2 = 45kb..1\r\nmeasure-command { compare ($a1) ($a2) } | % seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n25\r\n```\r\n\r\nWorkaround, about 25x faster.  I tried larger arrays, 1..700kb, without the sort, but after 8 minutes I gave up.  With sorting, it took about 15 seconds.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$a1 = 1..45kb\r\n$a2 = 45kb..1\r\nmeasure-command { compare ($a1|sort) ($a2|sort) } | % seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
