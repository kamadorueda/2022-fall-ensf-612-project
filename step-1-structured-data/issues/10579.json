      "body": "Looks like a race condition where you need to close it between static field initialization and the first actual `PSConsoleReadLine.ReadLine` invocation.  I've seen it before, but it's very difficult to reproduce due to the timing required.\r\n\r\nThe cause is that the wait handle that `OnBreak` calls is created in [`DelayedOneTimeInitialize`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/blob/2e12332d58951a889bbdca742539041f7a85d303/PSReadLine/ReadLine.cs#L806) (which is only called on the first `ReadLine` call) and the break handler is set in [`PlatformWindows.OneTimeInit`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PSReadLine/blob/2e12332d58951a889bbdca742539041f7a85d303/PSReadLine/PlatformWindows.cs#L140) (which is ran when the singleton is created during static field initialization).",
