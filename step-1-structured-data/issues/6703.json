      "body": "I agree that it would be handy to be able to install the next _pre-release_ version of PowerShell Core via Homebrew, but note that it makes sense for the most recent _official release_ to be installed _by default_.\r\n\r\nIn other words: installing a pre-release version should be an act of _opting in_, similar to  how Chocolatey offers the `--pre` option for  installing pre-release versions.\r\n\r\nHowever, it looks like Homebrew has no equivalent feature per se, bu there is a feature intended for _older_, still-supported versions, where variant formulae are maintained with `@<version>` suffixes (e.g., the latest `gcc` formula is at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/gcc.rb, whereas the previous major version is still available at https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/gcc@6.rb)\r\n\r\nSo, perhaps a new formula for _pre-release_ versions could be maintained at https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/powershell@pre.rb (to complement the latest-official-release formula at https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/powershell.rb)\r\n\r\nThe upshot is:\r\n\r\n* Someone would have  to create - and maintain - a separate formula at https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/blob/master/Casks/powershell@pre.rb for the latest pre-release version, assuming that pre-releases fit into Homebrew's versioning scheme (see doc link below).\r\n\r\n* You'd then have to install with `brew cask install powershell@pre` to get the latest pre-release version, and side-by-side-installation issues have to be worked out.\r\n\r\nHere's Homebrew's documentation about versions: https://docs.brew.sh/Versions\r\n",
