Test the path with the `Test-Path -Path \"$env:USERPROFILE\\PS\" -PathType Container #checking for folder of name PS`\r\n3. It returns true when is expected false, as PS folder does not exist.

      "body": "> `New-Item -Path $env:USERPROFILE -Item PS #this is a file`\r\n\r\nThis does not work for me, it gives \"the type is not a known type for the file system. Only \"file\",\"directory\", or \"symboliclink\" can be specified. (`-Item` maps to the `-ItemType` parameter, so that should be set to `-ItemType File` for this test, I think?)\r\n\r\nIf I fix that command and run:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nNew-Item -Path $env:USERPROFILE -ItemType File -Name PS\r\n```\r\n\r\nand then subsequently use Test-Path to check for a container at that location, I get a false result back:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nPS> Test-Path $env:USERPROFILE\\PS -PathType Container\r\nFalse\r\n```",
