  "body": "Install-PowerShellRemoting.ps1 assumes that it is run from within the instance of PowerShell that it is registering. #1626 blocks this scenario.\n\nTo fix it for Aug17th, we need to add a new optional parameter to the script to enable inbox PowerShell to register the remoting endpoint for another instance of PowerShell.\n\n-PowerShellHome <absolute path to the PSHOME of the new PowerShell instance>\n\nThe script should be able to extract the PowerShell version number from $PSHOME\\powershell.version instead of from $psversiontable.psversion. Those two bits of information are all the script needs to register the PowerShell endpoint.\n",
