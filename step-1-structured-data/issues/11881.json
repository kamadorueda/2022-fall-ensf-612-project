It instead behaves somewhat more closely to how it behaves in Bash and Bash-like shells, where it acts on the _perceived success or failure of the prior command_.\r\n\r\n`&&` only triggers the following statement if the prior statement succeeds. `||` is the exact opposite. Whether or not a statement _succeeds_ is typically down to whether or not it generates an error of some kind, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nYou can do something similar to what you seem to be looking to do with PS's logical `-and` operator to a similar effect:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$entry -and ($entries += $entry)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, do note that `-and` is a logical expression and will always return true or false. If you want this to behave like the if statement, you'll need to also capture or redirect the output:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$entry -and ($entries += $entry) > $null\r\n\r\n# or\r\n\r\n$null = $entry -and ($entries += $entry)\r\n```",

I have never seen anything like that before. That's actually pretty awesome.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed awesome if you learn to harness it to your advantage.\r\n\r\nPowerShell balances many worlds deftly (mostly - interaction with external programs is a perennial trouble spot), but the challenge is that if you come from only _one_ similar world, such as Unix shells or traditional programming languages, and expect everything to work the same, pain ensues.\r\n\r\nWhile you can limp along with only ever using `return` and `echo 'foo'`, ..., it really pays to familiarize yourself with the fundamentals of PowerShell, which is what @vexx32's PS Koans project helps with (plus the `about_*`  topics he mentions).\r\n\r\nPart of learning the fundamentals is learning how to use the help system (`Get-Help`) effectively, so you can perform targeted lookups not just for whole commands, but also for examples and individual parameters.\r\n\r\nThere is no support (yet) for looking up _operators_ directly via `Get-Help` - see the suggestion in #11339, which also points to a helper command, `Show-OperatorHelp`, which would allow you to run <br>`Show-OperatorHelp '&&'`, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
