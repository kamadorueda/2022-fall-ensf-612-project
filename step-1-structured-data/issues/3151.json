  "body": "On the repo homepage, there are a set of MSI links but as far as I know, Nano Server does not support MSI.  Furthermore, the instructions page mentions \"Full SKU\" which gives me the impression it does not document installation on Nano Server.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I request that instructions be added on how to install the latest version of PowerShell 6 onto Nano Server.",
