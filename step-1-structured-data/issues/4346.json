The cursor is visibly jumping back and forth on its line when coloring changes (first word of the command is colored yellow), or even if I type fast enough, garbage characters appear mid-line and the cursor jumps one line down... it's as if the entire line would be redrawn but VERY slowly. No human being can type faster than one char per few tens of milliseconds, and it really should not take that long to put a character on the screen.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is one the last standing reasons why it's not my default shell on any linux box.\r\n",

Typing on the console garbles the actual line in strange ways. It does resemble things that I typed, but not quite.\r\n\r\nThat having said, I wanted to investigate more. I was using ssh.exe that ships with the Git installation of Visual Studio (why install another one, if that works? It's under `VSROOT\\Common7\\IDE\\CommonExtensions\\Microsoft\\TeamFoundation\\Team Explorer\\Git\\usr\\bin\\ssh.exe`) I wanted to try the OpenSSH-Win32 executable (v0.0.19), because I know that acts weird in other ways. With that the cursor still jumps like crazy with psreadline enabled, but works more or less. (Hard to type fast enough to ruin the actual line, coloring works...) Disabling psreadline removes coloring and cursor jumping. This SSH client however does not relay cursor buttons properly (among others), so I cannot walk the history or move the cursor in VIM. (SSH that ships with 'Git for Windows' does not work either)\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have an SSH client that relays AltGr+whatever, cursor buttons, Ctrl+c correctly AND works with powershell over SSH? It's not hard to test, just install a Hungarian layout for instance, turn on the onscreen keyboard and try sending AltGr+stuff, to see if you can type #&@<>[]{}\\$; etc. just about everything you use for scripting and programming.\r\n\r\nEither I don't have special chars, or powershell doesn't work. The choice is mine. :)",
