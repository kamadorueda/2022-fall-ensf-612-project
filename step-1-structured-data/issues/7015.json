  "body": "I would like to install help documents on my Linux system globally, rather than per-user. The documentation for `Update-Help` states that in order to install help to `$PSHome`, I should use the command `Start-Process PowerShell -Verb RunAs` in order to run `Get-Help` as admin. Without elevated privelages, the help documents are installed in the user's `~/.local/share/powershell` directory.\r\n\r\nThis does not work on Linux (and I assume Mac): Start-Process : `The parameter '-Verb' is not supported for the cmdlet 'Start-Process' on this edition of PowerShell.` Starting powershell with `sudo` to run as root does not work either--it instead installs help into `/root`, the root users home directory. \r\n\r\nIs there a way to globally install help on Linux? If not, there should be, if so, it should be better documented.\r\n\r\nOf course, it's possible I just missed something, but I have checked the help document for `Update-Help` several times.",
