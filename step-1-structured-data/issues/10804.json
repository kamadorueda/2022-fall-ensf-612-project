We're happy to point you in the right direction and help you find any resources you need! \ud83d\udc96 ",

      "body": "@vexx32 Sorry, this was actually my first pull request on GitHub and I thought that since #7712 is tagged `Up-For-Grabs`, it is still accepting PRs. I also didn't notice the PR that was already submitted.\r\n\r\nSo, for future reference: should I tackle only issues that are tagged `Up-For-Grabs` AND that do not have any submitted PRs? Is there anything else that I should maybe take into account?\r\n\r\nAnd finally, in regards to the current PR, should I close it personally?",

      "body": "You're totally fine! \r\n\r\nPerhaps we as the maintainers could try to keep slightly closer tabs on Up-for-Grabs issues and remove the label when someone submits a PR, but I'd have to convene with the others and see what they think. It is a bit of additional overhead, but we may want to be doing that during Hacktoberfest where it's more a possibility that we'll get collisions like this.\r\n\r\nIn general, it's probably best to comment on the issue and ask -- just in case. \ud83d\ude42 Usually those PRs will reference the issue and become visible in the issue thread itself. In most cases, authors will comment in the issues themselves and ask if they can take care of it / mention that they're working on it so that folks know. But we're all human, and things can be overlooked! So it doesn't hurt to check, even if you don't see such a comment / PR reference. \r\n\r\nThere's a good handful of us keeping a watchful eye, so in most cases we'll jump in with an answer within a day or two at most. I can close this one for now, no worries. \ud83d\ude0a \r\n\r\n",
