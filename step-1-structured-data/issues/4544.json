Both methods do not allow using certificates from files. This breaks client certificate authentication on non-Windows platforms.\r\n\r\n**Proposal**: Support the use of certificate files for the client authentication by adding a new parameter _-CertificateFile_ or by using the x509 object from `Get-PfxCertificate` directly.\r\n\r\nThis was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with PowerShell 6.0.0-beta.5 and on Windows with PowerShell 5.0.\r\n\r\nRef: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/473 and https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1865",

I see that it is now available in CoreFX and I have working build on Linux with the [changes implemented](https://github.com/markekraus/PowerShell/blob/WebClientCerts/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/WebCmdlet/CoreCLR/WebRequestPSCmdlet.CoreClr.cs#L172). Now I just need to figure out how to add tests for it. It's not exactly a `-CertificateFile` but it does work with `Get-PfxCertificate`.",
