      "body": "My thought was about the _comfort of GitHub filter to find the PRs_, say half a year later, when we will change documentation. (All the more so because the changelog does not contain numbers of PRs).\nI would like to clarify the purpose of `Changelog Needed`. If we need to make changes in the changelog, we set the label. After changing log we need to close the process and change the label to another `Changelog Done`.\nHence the need other tags for documenting `Doc-Needed`, `Doc-Fixed`.\nIf PG uses this label `Changelog Needed` for all of this, then of course the new tags are not needed. But it is not very convenient to search as I mentioned above.\n",

Unfortunately, our docs exist in another repo, PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs, and the docset for 6.0 isn't yet there. \n\nI'm working with @JuanPabloJofre to spin up a 6.0 docset [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docs/tree/staging/reference) so that we can enforce this requirement. \n",
