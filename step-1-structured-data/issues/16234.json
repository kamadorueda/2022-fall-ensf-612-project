  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nHey, using a network inspector, I realized that Powershell sends a request to Microsoft servers on startup and I guess it's an update check, because once I get a notification on startup that there's a new Powershell version available. However, I don't like this behavior, and as I installed it from Microsoft Store I'll know if there's an update from there. I have some delay when I start Powershell (It's slow to show prompt and execute first command) so if there was a way to disable this it would help to reduce this delay.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
