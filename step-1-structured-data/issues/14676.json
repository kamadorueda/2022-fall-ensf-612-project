  "body": "Related: #14677\r\n\r\nNote: This bug affects Windows PowerShell too.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$obj = [pscustomobject] @{ a='A'; b='1234567890'; c='C' }\r\n\r\n# OK - custom width is in the *first* column.\r\n$obj | Format-Table -Property @{ e='b'; width = 5 }, c | Out-String | Should -Match '1234\u2026'\r\n\r\n# !! BROKEN: custom width is (only) in a column *other* than the first:\r\n$obj | Format-Table -Property a, @{ e='b'; width = 5 }, c | Out-String | Should -Match '1234\u2026'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests should succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe 2nd test fails, because the custom column width was unexpectedly not applied.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected regular expression '1234\u2026' to match ' a b          c - -          - A 1234567890 C  ', but it did not match.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that, similarly, custom widths in _later_ columns only take effect if one was specified for and successfully applied to the first column.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.2\r\n```\r\n",
