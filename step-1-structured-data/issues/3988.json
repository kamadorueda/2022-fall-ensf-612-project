We should enhance it to give a better experience like the `git` command on typos for arguments or `apt-get` finding apps to install that fit your missing command (leveraging PowerShellGet).",

      "body": "We already have a Issue #3955 to put HelpSystem in a separate module. This will allow _different_ Help systems. We can deal with these issues together. I believe HeplSystem should have not only a description of the commands but also a description of the errors. This is very related.\r\n\r\nOption to turn on/off suggestions.\r\n\r\nGet a help for an error:\r\n Get-Help -Error    - for last error\r\n Get-Help -Error nnn    - for `$error[nnn]` error\r\n Get-Help -Error $error[kkk] - for `$error[kkk]` error\r\n Get-Help -FullyQualifiedErrorId <name>\r\n\r\nWe could add an option for error detail:\r\n - only short generic error message\r\n - short error message optionally with short help message (like current behavior)\r\n - long error message with long help message\r\n\r\nWe could review all Resx error strings to move it to a common format template.",
