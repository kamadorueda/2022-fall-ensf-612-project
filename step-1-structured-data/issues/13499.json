  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis is sort of a mix between a bug and a feature request, but...\r\n\r\n`SteppablePipeline.Begin` has a `void` return type even though `begin` blocks can emit pipeline output.  These means if you aren't passing an `EngineIntrinsics` or `InternalCommand` to `SteppablePipeline.Begin` any pipeline output is just swallowed.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace System.Management.Automation\r\n{\r\n    public sealed class SteppablePipeline : IDisposable\r\n    {\r\n+        public Array BeginWithOutput(bool expectingInput);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n(except probably with better name)\r\n\r\nOr:\r\n\r\n\r\n```diff\r\nnamespace System.Management.Automation\r\n{\r\n    public sealed class SteppablePipeline : IDisposable\r\n    {\r\n+        public void Begin(bool expectingInput, out Array output);\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
