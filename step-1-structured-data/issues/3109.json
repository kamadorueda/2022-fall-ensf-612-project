  "body": "When running PSCommands which contain AddScript calls through Debugger.ProcessCommand, the scripts in those commands are always added to the user's command history.  Any host that relies on Get-History to retrieve the command history will end up with items which the user didn't personally execute in the debugger.  It'd be nice if there was a ProcessCommand overload (or some other way) to indicate that the executed command shouldn't be added to the command history.\r\n\r\n/cc @PaulHigin @lzybkr ",
