However, for a Unix user using Powershell the current behavior is somewhat confusing. I'm not sure what's the proper solution here. Maybe add a \"permission\" column for Unix permissions?\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nThe mode column only shows `d` for directories. Here's the output of both `Get-ChildItem` and the system's built-in's `/bin/ls`\r\n```none\r\nPS /tmp/testing> ls -l\r\ntotal 0\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 2 rodarwis wheel 64 Dec  4 13:30 dir\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 rodarwis wheel  0 Dec  4 13:30 file\r\nPS /tmp/testing> Get-ChildItem\r\n\r\n\r\n    Directory: /tmp/testing\r\n\r\nMode                LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                -------------         ------ ----\r\nd-----        12/04/2019    13:30                dir\r\n------        12/04/2019    13:30              0 file\r\n\r\nPS /tmp/testing>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.3\r\nOS                             Darwin 19.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.0.0: Thu Oct 17 16:17:15 PDT 2019; root:xnu-6153.41.3~29/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

If you grab the latest v7 preview you'll note an experimental feature has been added to retrieve this information (many thanks to @JamesWTruher for that one, it's very handy!)\r\n\r\nIf for whatever reason it isn't enabled (in most cases it will be enabled by default in preview versions) you can enable it with:\r\n```powershell\r\nEnable-ExperimentalFeature -Name PSUnixFileStat\r\n```\r\n\r\nFeedback on experimental features is always welcome, as well. \ud83d\ude0a ",
