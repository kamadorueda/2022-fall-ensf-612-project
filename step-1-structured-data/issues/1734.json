      "body": "This change addresses the issue when the wldp.dll binary is missing or otherwise unloadable.  Currently if this happens it is assumed that PowerShell is running on a down level OS and applies no enforcement.  However, it is possible that enforcement is needed but wldp.dll is just not loadable.  \nThe fix is to use a Win10 alternative API (NtQuerySystemInformation) to check code integrity policy for enforcement.  On down level machines this API will return an error code and PowerShell will return \"no enforcement\" as before, allowing the code to continue checking other enforcement policies (such as group policy).\n\nRepro steps:\n1.  On Win10 apply Device Guard CI policy.\n2.  Go to windir\\system32 and make wldp.dll unloadable (remove, rename, set acl)\n3.  Start PowerShell\n\nResult:\nPowerShell is in full language mode.  Device Guard policy is bypassed.\n\nExpected:\nPowerShell is in constrained language mode.\n",
