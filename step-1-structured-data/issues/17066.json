  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nMicrosoft Windows operating system comes with preinstalled virtual printers such as _Microsoft Print to PDF_, _Microsoft XPS Document Writer_, _Fax_, etc.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is required to select only the hardware printers (Cannon, HP, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe ```Get-Printer``` cmdlet does not have an object that differentiates between hardware and software printers. \r\n\r\nI'm suggesting to introduce a new object to specify the type of printer.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
