  "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTest-Connection with the -quiet parameter is performing inversely to what the microsoft documents state it will. The description of -quiet states \"If any ping to a given target succeeds, $True is returned. If all pings to a given target fail, $False is returned.\" I can confirm this works as described in Powershell 5.1, but in 7+ it appears to work inversely. If any of the the replies are fail then the bool returns $false. I have tested it several times and it has always reproduced the same results.

      "body": "@vexx32 Thank you for the rapid response. I personally would think the original function of the cmdlet was the more useful as if there is any reply from the target, it at least has marginal connectivity. In the method I am using it, the command was throwing false positives with around 1% packet loss at times. But perhaps I am an outlier in this situation. ",
