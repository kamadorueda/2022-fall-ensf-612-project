      "body": "Sure I pipe values in to an array and present those values to be chosen in the Out-Grid.  These values contain spaces and searching for them is difficult.  I am currently using [Get-CMDriver] to pull all Windows drivers from ConfigMgr (SCCM/MEMCM) , then I present those drivers for selection via Out-GridView.  The driver list can be 10,000 drivers long and I need to narrow my search for the driver I am looking for.  That search field is the best way to accomplish this. I pull driver [name] and [ContentPath]  fields and  I use Out-GridView to locate the drivers I am look to remove from SCCM\\MEMCM by their ContentPath.  The ContentPath  contains spaces [Win 10 - Dell - Latitude 3400 (64Bit) A05] and I would love to type [Latitude 3400] but I can only type [Latitude3400].  As a result I have to copy the text [Latitude 3400] to perform my search in order to select the object I wish to interact with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGC\n",
