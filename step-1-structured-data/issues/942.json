That account will need to be an admin.\r\n- setting up certs on windows is a pain, which means you probably will be doing basic auth over http. Bit of a security problem.\r\n- there are still a bunch of bugs I am working through in the psrp wsman client.\r\n- Cannot disconnect/reconnect yet -- working on it\r\n- ntlm over spnego authentication is present and working for Linux to Windows, and we can do encryption over http which is the windows default. We are working on documentation to enable this though as it is not straight forward. It also has problems on some older machines. OSX is even more of a pain and not enabled yet.\r\n\r\nBy all means play with it, but note we are still finishing off the feature and still fixing bugs in stability.",
