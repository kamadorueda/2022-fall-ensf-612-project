This issues type is unrelated to snap packages with a distribution neutral.\r\n- Processor Architecture (One per request):  amd64\r\n- The following is a requirement for supporting a distribution **without exception.**\r\n    - [x] The version and architecture of the Distribution is [supported by .NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/5.0/5.0-supported-os.md#linux).\r\n- The following are requirements for supporting a distribution.\r\n  Please write a justification for any exception where these criteria are not met and\r\n  the PowerShell committee will review the request.\r\n    - [x] The version of the Distribution is supported for at least one year.\r\n    - [x] The version of the Distribution is not an [interim release](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) or equivalent.\r\n\r\n## Progress\r\n\r\n- [x] An issues has been filed to create a Docker image in https://github.com/powershell/powershell-docker\r\n\r\n### For PowerShell Team **ONLY**\r\n\r\n- [ ] Docker image created - https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-Docker/issues/558\r\n- [ ] Docker image published\r\n- [ ] Distribution tested\r\n- [ ] Update `packages.microsoft.com` deployment\r\n- [ ] [Lifecycle](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/docs-conceptual/PowerShell-Support-Lifecycle.md) updated\r\n- [ ] Documentation Updated\r\n\r\nThere is already an issue open for Ubuntu 20.04 - https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/12626 - but that one seems to target just 7.1.x and also close for comments.\r\n\r\nConsidering that net core 3.1 is the LTS and supported on Ubuntu 20.04, and PSCore 7.0.x is the LTS and based on the same .net core 3.1, I would expect that PSCore 7.0.x is supported also on Ubuntu 20.04 but there is no package available.\r\n\r\nTo add to the confusion, the information about supporting 7.0.x on Ubuntu 20.04 is conflictual in the documentation:\r\n- Here is mentioned as NOT supported: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/powershell-support-lifecycle?view=powershell-7\r\n- Here is mentioned as supported: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux?view=powershell-7",
