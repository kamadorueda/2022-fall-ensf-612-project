The comment on line 39 should be cleaned up to be \"powershell.6.0.0-beta.3\"\r\n1. Line 78 should be uncommented. The registry file doesn't get cleaned up during MSI uninstallation\r\n1. The comment on line 116 should be moved to line 3 to become the introductory description since it provides an overview of the script. Right now, it is buried in the middle and hard to find.\r\n",
