  "body": "We are using remote PowerShell deployment via VSTS and calling the deployment script.\r\n\r\nWhen I am running this script from a VSTS agent (agent is running on Windows 2008 R2) and deploying on a machine (target) with Windows 2012, the script is able to pass the parameters. But when I am trying to deploy it on a target machine with Windows 2008 none of the arguments are passed.\r\n\r\nEdit, for better reference, pasting the complete code of the function:\r\n\r\nfunction ExecuteDSCScript([string]$file, [string]$machine, [object]$params) {\r\n    # Sample value for $file is MyDeploymentFolder\\MyDeploymentScript.ps1\r\n    $arguments = \"\"\r\n\r\n    foreach ($param in $params) {\r\n        $arguments = $arguments + \" -\" + $param.name + \" '\" + $param.value + \"'\" #Param is a key value pair\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    Write-Verbose $arguments.ToString() -Verbose\r\n\r\n    $command = $file + $arguments + \" -Ensure \" + $Ensure + \" -DeployServerName \" + $machine #Forming PS command for remote execution\r\n\r\n    # writing command in log with our password\r\n    $paramslogging = $params\r\n\r\n    foreach ($param in $paramslogging) {\r\n        if ($param.Name.ToLower() -eq \"password\") {\r\n            #masking the password so that it doesnt appear on console logs\r\n            $param.Value= \"************\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    $argumentslogging = \"\"\r\n\r\n    foreach ($param in $paramslogging) {\r\n        $argumentslogging = $argumentslogging + \" -\" + $param.Name + \" '\" + $param.Value + \"'\"\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    $commandlogging = $file + $argumentslogging + \" -Ensure \" + $Ensure + \" -DeployServerName \" + $machine\r\n\r\n    Write-Verbose $commandlogging -Verbose  # I am able to get the complete list of parameters here (i.e. value of $argumentslogging)\r\n\r\n    $result = Invoke-Expression -Command $command\r\n}\r\n\r\nUpdate:-\r\nOne more difference below are the .Net versions of the machines:-\r\nAgent - .Net 4.6\r\nTarget1 - .Net 4.6 (Where the script works)\r\nTarget2 - .Net 4.5.2 (Where the script doesn't work)",
