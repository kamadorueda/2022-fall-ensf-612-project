  "body": "In https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/15548 and https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/15491, `Start-PSBootstrap` fails but does not cause the particular CI step to fail. Instead the next step fails in a less specified way, since its failure is due to the bad state from the previous step.\r\n\r\nWe should fix the build task so that a failure in `Start-PSBootstrap` causes its own build step to fail.",
