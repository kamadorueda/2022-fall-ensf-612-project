  "body": "This work item is about the implementation of a key value configuration store, which can be used as an alternative to the Registry.  The store must be able to store arbitrary unicode string data for now, in addition it must be able to read from a single configuration file, that by default is located in the user home directory under   .psconfig  Additional requirements    the encoding on the filesystem for the string data must be UTF 8   the file on the filesystem must be fully text based and user editable  Suggested implementation    JSON configuration file in .psconfig, encoded in UTF 8  Suggested interface    string read string key   > returns a string value   void write string key, string value   > writes a value   int readInt string key   > returns the value and tries to convert to int  Basically every required Registry data type needs an equivalent. The important part here is required  we will only implement the ones that are actually used by the PS code    read is the equivalent to the registry data type REG_SZ   readInt is the equivalent to the registry data type REG_DWORD     VSO create date - 8/3/2015 8:38:00    \n",
