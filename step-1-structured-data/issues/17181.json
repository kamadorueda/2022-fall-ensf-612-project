  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTested on Windows 10/11 with PS 7.2 and 5.1 with the default PS terminal, \"Terminal\" and VSCode.\r\nSet your keyboard to a language that don't have the Latin alphabet, for example add Hebrew keyboard in the windows settings in addition to the English one.\r\n1. Start PowerShell.\r\n2. Set keyboard to the other language (like with `Alt + Shift` or in the taskbar).\r\n3. Press `Ctrl + C` (or `Ctrl + <Any letter>`).\r\n4. Terminal will print the letter (or something like \ufffd if the font doesn't have it) instead of the expected `^C`.\r\n5. Even if you switch back to English and `Ctrl + C` it will still print the letter from the other language.\r\n\r\nI didn't find a way to \"fix\" the session to make `Ctrl + C` work, only thing you can do is close it, open a new one and making sure the first  `Ctrl + C` you make is in English.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n`^C` always executed no matter what is your current active keyboard or what keyboard was active when it was first typed. Like in CMD for example.\r\n```console\r\nPS C:\\> ^C\r\nPS C:\\>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n`Ctrl + C` become unusable for the rest of the session if when it first used the keyboard wasn't on English.\r\n```console\r\nPS C:\\> \u05d1\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.22000\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n![Animation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6960531/164839296-6110cbfe-e044-4983-aec7-6925f885ad99.gif)\r\n",
