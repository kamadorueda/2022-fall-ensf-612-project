  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nThis is a weird one. \r\nI have a pwsh script that calls `psql` which in turn runs a `.sql` script which runs fine if I invoke the script from shell, but it would stuck if run from a program with `pwsh -file script.ps1`.\r\n(The program is running as root)\r\n\r\nI found that the issue is only with Linux binaries or native shell commands.\r\nFor example, a simple script like this would be stuck.\r\n```pwsh\r\nls\r\n```\r\nor \r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\nls > /tmp/test.out\r\nSet-Content /tmp/continue \"good\"\r\n```\r\nHowever, as long as I only use pwsh commands, the script would finish.\r\n\r\nAlso, the linux binaries like `psql` and `ls` does actually run to finish but stuck at passing back control to the pwsh script.\r\nIn the above test script, `/tmp/test.out` does actually get written but the `Set-Content` never gets run.\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nThe script continues running\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nStuck at binaries or native commands\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Linux 4.14.268-205.500.amzn2.x86_64 #1 SMP Wed Mar 2 18:38:38 UTC 2022\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u0393\u00c7\u00aa}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
