      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT,\r\n\r\nThx for your reply, I have two main usages of the split window.\r\n\r\n1/ When I connect to my remote admin server by PSRemoting from my desktop. As it's a admin server, I often need to launch multiple powershell windows to manage other servers. And as we don't have the split window yet, I have to launch multiple PSRemoting from my desktop, it takes time.\r\n\r\n2/ In VSCode for Windows, we can only see one terminal at the same time, I really need multiple terminal consoles at the same time instead of  switching among them each time. Cmder is a GUI application that cannot be intergrated into VSCode terminal. \r\n\r\nIf the Powershell team doesn't want to implement the split windows, we don't have any other choice ...",

A bit kludgy, but it works just fine and ALL of tmux is available... split screens, tabs, resizing windows, etc.  I imagine there may be better shortcuts... maybe some form of \"wsl tmux -c powershell.exe\" or the like, but I haven't explored it that deeply.",
