An id like \"Test\" is not the same as \"TEST\" and therefore it's not a duplicate id!\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",

The handling in the script or module is down to how it was coded; PowerShell can do case-sensitive comparisons just fine, if you write the code in that way.\r\n\r\nI'm going to convert this to a discussion for the time being as it looks like this pertains to something that is external to the repository. I would also highly recommend asking around community channels (e.g., https://aka.ms/psdiscord) for assistance, as the folks there may be more familiar with the module or script you happen to be working with.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://cdn.discordapp.com/splashes/180528040881815552/4438e80f2285729408fc8ab64921cdc7.jpg?size=512\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"/assets/ec2c34cadd4b5f4594415127380a85e6.ico\" height=\"14\"> Discord</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/vFrjnxP\">Join the PowerShell Discord Server!</a></strong></div><div>Check out the PowerShell community on Discord - hang out with 8,996 other members and enjoy free voice and text chat.</div></blockquote>",
