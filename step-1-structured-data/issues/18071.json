That is, `cmdlet` sees the _elements_ of `$x` as input, one by one, in the pipeline scenario, whereas it sees `$x` _as a whole_ in the argument scenario.\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/4242\r\n\r\nprovides the backstory.\r\n",

That expectation grows up because that's how well written commands work. PowerShell classes teach people that `foreach ($f in $files)  {Invoke-Something $f}` is rarely necessary and `$files | inovke-Something` or `invoke-Something $files`  is \"normal\", and that they should write new commands to work that way.    \r\n\r\n Your later description that in some cases \" _not_ enumerating results in _useless_ behavior \"  sums it up neatly :-)  Useless, and (I think) often unexpected   \r\n\r\nSome things like `Get-Member`, do the right thing by _not_ enumerating, (how else do we learn about the enumerable object ?  ) For export-CSV it's the wrong thing - and finding and fixing similar cases would be a benefit.  \r\n",
