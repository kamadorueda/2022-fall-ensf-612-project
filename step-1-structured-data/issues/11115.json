  "body": "Get-CimInstance documentation states that the parameter **-Property** can be used to limit bandwidth by only retrieving the requested list of properties:\r\n[Help Page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/cimcmdlets/get-ciminstance?view=powershell-6)\r\nSee example 9.\r\n\r\nIn reality, Get-CimInstance always seems to return *all* properties, regardless of the use of -Property or -Query. No network bandwidth is saved.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\nRun this:\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-CimInstance -Class Win32_Process -Property Name,KernelModeTime\r\n```\r\nThe issue is present also in queries:\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-CimInstance -Query \"Select Name, KernelModeTime from Win32_Process\" \r\n```\r\nHere, though, there seems to be another oddity: the command outputs data that shows only a few table columns. However, all properties are available:\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-CimInstance -Query \"Select Name, KernelModeTime from Win32_Process\" | Select-Object *\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nBoth calls should just retrieve the specified properties. \r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nAll properties are returned. No network bandwidth is saved. Results must be sent to `Select-Object` on the client side to get the desired result.\r\n\r\nWhen I use either **-Property** or **-Query**, `Get-CimInstance` returns objects of type *TypeName: Microsoft.Management.Infrastructure.CimInstance#__PartialCIMInstance*, else it is the full instance. So it must be related to the part that \"fills\" the partial instance IMHO.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nI was able to test only on a local system. The same issue is present when I remote against the own system, both with DCOM and WsMan. It might be interesting to see what the results are when data is actually retrieved from a real remote system where network bandwidth plays a role. Possibly, **-Property** is implemented to work only there. However, I would expect it to work always.\r\n\r\nThe issue is present in **PowerShell Core** and **Windows PowerShell** so seems to be a long standing bug, unless I am overlooking something really stupid and run the wrong command.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
