  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThis is something that was discovered with the WinPS over implicit remoting feature.  If a module exposes a PSDrive that is used over PowerShell remoting, we generate proxy functions used locally that remote the calls.  We should have something similar for PSDrives (whether used via implicit remoting or enable `new-psdrive` to point to a remote machine).\r\n",
