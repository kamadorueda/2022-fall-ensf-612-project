  "body": "Assuming \"a\" and \"b\" refer to non-existing filesystem items (CWD is \"C:\\\", Windows system NTFS partition), executing `Copy-Item a b` produces, as expected, an error where Powershell can't find \"a\":\r\n\r\n    Copy-Item : Cannot find path 'C:\\a' because it does not exist.\r\n\r\nAdding the `-Exclude c` parameter like `Copy-Item a b -Exclude c` makes, however, the otherwise identical command succeed without errors (checked success with `echo $?` which returns `True`). Whether `c` is an existing item or not is inconsequential here.\r\n\r\nI would say this behavior is very unexpected. I expect the second command to *fail because source does not exist*, irrespective of which paths under the source were to be excluded during copying.\r\n\r\nCan anyone comment on this? Am I missing something?\r\n\r\nOutput of `echo $PSVersionTable`:\r\n\r\n- PSVersion                      5.0.10586.117                                                                                                                                \r\n- PSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                                                      \r\n- BuildVersion                   10.0.10586.117                                                                                                                               \r\n- CLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000                                                                                                                              \r\n- WSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                                                          \r\n- PSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                                                          \r\n- SerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n\r\nWindows 7 x86_64 (6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601).\r\n\r\nThank you.",
