Also, it's not even a real type, afaik it's just a parser trick to tell PowerShell to build the resulting dictionary completely differently (since if it was built the normal way and _then_ cast, the resulting dictionary would not retain the original order in the script).\r\n\r\nFlagging this for WG-Engine to have a look at.",

I would also have expected it to simply skip the type resolution completely, since it's... not intended to be a type in itself. \ud83e\udd14 \r\n\r\nEven if you define a type called `[ordered]` in the current session, it still doesn't get _used_ for an `[ordered]@{ ... }` expression, so it's very odd to me that type lookup would ever be implicated. For example:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nPS> class ordered {ordered([hashtable]$d) { }}\r\nPS> $a = [ordered]@{ a = 1; b = 2 }\r\nPS> $a\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\na                              1\r\nb                              2\r\n\r\nPS> $a.GetType().FullName\r\nSystem.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso... a type simply named \"ordered\" is actually _unusable_ because of how the parser handles `[ordered]`:\r\n\r\n```ps1\r\nPS> $b = [ordered]$a\r\nParserError:\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  $b = [ordered]$a\r\n     |      ~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n     | The ordered attribute can be specified only on a hash literal node.\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it's... really weird... that `[ordered]` in this position does _any_ type lookups whatsoever.\r\n\r\nSidenote: you _can_ use a type named `[ordered]` with `-as` (`$a -as [ordered]`), but it's entirely unusable for a direct cast.",

Maybe not fall back as that might lead to confusion that we already face with `[pscustomobject]` outside of compiler recognized scenarios.

Is that something we want to change?\r\n> 2. more generally, shall we optimize the parser to not keep attempting to resolve a type name when it cannot be resolved?\r\n\r\n~To the 1st question, we think it's a good idea to make `[ordered]` a true type accelerator for `[System.Collections.Specialized.OrderedDictionary]` and remove the parser code that restricts `[ordered]` to only be used before a literal Hashtable. We believe this will help making the `[ordered]` type less special and more consistent with `[pscustomobject]`.~ Addressed by https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/17804\r\n\r\nTo the 2nd question, the same performance degradation would happen to another non-resolvable type name in the script, so it would be nice to resolve this perf issue in the root -- not looking up a non-resolvable type name multiple times during parse would provide a significant boost to performance.",
