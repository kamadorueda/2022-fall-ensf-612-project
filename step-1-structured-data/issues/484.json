I still haven't quite figure out why bash is not displaying the prompt, but try this:  If \"string cmdToExecute = ReadALine()\" is uncommented, compile, run, and type \"/bin/bash\" in first line, and \"dir\" in second line.  Note that \"dir\" is not echoed.  Type \"exit\" to exit.  Now, comment out that line, and uncomment \"string cmdToExecute = \"/bin/bash\".  Build, run, and type \"dir\", and note that it's echoed correctly.\n\nLet me know if you can/can't repro this.\n",
