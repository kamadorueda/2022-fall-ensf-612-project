  "body": "Please provide PowerShell in the AppImage format for Linux.\n\n[AppImage](http://appimage.org/) is a packaging format for Linux that lets users download one single file, set the executable bit and run the application (here: PowerShell). Unlike other solutions, no special runtime infrastructure must be installed on the target system(s).\n\n![PowerShell](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L8aJhKxmYww/V7YKJ1sS5QI/AAAAAAAAASc/T6jPV_-h-WQTnbIqx2FZ6egnTHP2XaEbACL0B/w506-h358/snap.png)\n\nAn unofficial PowerShell AppImage has been available on https://bintray.com/probono/AppImages/PowerShell#files. It has been tested on\n- CentOS-7.0-1406-x86_64-GnomeLive.iso\n- CentOS-7-x86_64-LiveGNOME-1511.iso\n- Chromixium-1.5-amd64.iso\n- Fedora-Live-Workstation-x86_64-22-3.iso\n- Fedora-Live-Workstation-x86_64-23-10.iso\n- SL-72-x86_64-2016-02-03-LiveDVDgnome.iso\n- debian-live-8.0.0-amd64-xfce-desktop+nonfree.iso\n- debian-live-8.4.0-amd64-gnome-desktop.iso\n- elementary_OS_0.3_freya_amd64.iso\n- kali-linux-2.0-amd64.iso\n- kali-linux-2016.1-amd64.iso\n- kubuntu-14.04.4-desktop-amd64.iso\n- kubuntu-15.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n- kubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n- linuxmint-17.3-cinnamon-64bit.iso\n- neon-devedition-gitunstable-20160814-0806-amd64.iso\n- netrunner-17-64bit.iso\n- ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-amd64.iso\n- ubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n- ubuntu-gnome-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n- ubuntu-mate-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n- xubuntu-16.04-desktop-amd64.iso\n\nTo try it, run\n\n```\nPS=\"PowerShell-6.0.0.alpha.9-x86_64.AppImage\"\nwget -c \"https://bintray.com/probono/AppImages/download_file?file_path=$PS\" -O \"$PS\"\nchmod a+x \"$PS\"\n./\"$PS\"\n```\n\n@TravisEz13 mentioned that the AppImage works for him and @andschwa mentioned that he likes the idea of having one format for all Linux distributions.\n\nThe script that generated the AppImage is [here](https://github.com/probonopd/AppImages/blob/master/recipes/powershell/Recipe). Feel free to use it, e.g. as part of the automated Travis CI build process. I am happy to help.\n",
