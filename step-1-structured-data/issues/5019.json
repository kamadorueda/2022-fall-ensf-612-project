  "body": "CentOS 7.2, Powershell Core 6 Beta 8.\r\n\r\nI'm attempting to call just a basic Powershell command (/usr/bin/powershell -Command \"& {Write-Output 'Hello, world'}\") in a script that is run by a software agent. No matter how the simple command (or PS1) file is passed, the error results similarly:\r\n\r\n> FailFast: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\r\n> \r\n>    at System.Environment.FailFast(System.String, System.Exception)\r\n>    at System.Environment.FailFast(System.String, System.Exception)\r\n>    at Microsoft.PowerShell.UnmanagedPSEntry.Start(System.String, System.String[], Int32)\r\n>    at Microsoft.PowerShell.ManagedPSEntry.Main(System.String[])\r\n> /tmp/f1cbae6e-1431-4ae9-b63c-d40c007de59e/task.sh: line 3:  2366 Aborted                 /usr/bin/powershell -Command \"& {Write-Output 'Hello, world'}\"\r\n> Error while executing script: Process exited with an error: 134 (Exit value: 134)\r\n\r\nPrepending this command with strace -v yields the following output.\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/4upjmfrf6x2zn8h/ps-coretask.stdlog?dl=0\r\n\r\nAfter getting some help on the powershell-help channel on Slack, a review of the output as linked above showed no environmental variables being passed (HOME, USER, or PATH). This script is executed as root via an agent. Even passing the command as HOME=/root /usr/bin/powershell -Command \"& {Write-Output 'Hello, world'}\" still produces failure with the same message as shown above.\r\n\r\nHowever, when manually logging into the system as root and executing either a PS1 script or this simple command, the result is always successful. An example of a successful strace -v dump from such an attempt can be found here. (Both of the strace dumps are too large for Pastebin and would flood this thread.)\r\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/bfsxqfrndrd0yvp/strace-good-dump.txt?dl=0\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what other forensics I can provide that would be of assistance in isolating this issue and possibly determining a viable workaround.",
