  "body": "The CoreFx repo downloads the reference assemblies for Core .net during it's windows build. It uses nuget internally.  Use the same nuget mechanism to fetch those reference assemblies instead of using the ones from the monad ext repo.  The reference assemblies for .net are stored in src monad ext coreclr TargetingPack  relative to the monad linux repo   This is currently blocked by CoreCLR providing packages that can be consumed    The reference assemblies cannot be built by an open source tool, so we can't automate the building and usage of CoreCLR and CoreFX, which leaves us tied to ProjectK, instead of the open source GitHub hosted codebase.
