      "body": "We found pwsh crashing with the latest build of .NET Core 3.0 and it turned out that was because we have code like `typeof(String).GetMehtod(\"get_Chars\")` which assumes the public method/property has no overloads in the target type, however, 2 more overloads of `Chars` get added to `String` in .NET Core 3.\r\n\r\nSo for code like `GetMethod(string)`, `GetProperty(string)` and similar call sites, we should make it explicit by specifying the parameter types, so we won't get into the same pit again in future.",

My question is, can we select a subset that needs to be corrected or should we correct _all_ the lines, since we cannot predict which api will be expanded with a new overload?\r\n\r\nThe second question is that we first caught such a problem, i.e. this is a very rare event - is it worth the effort or the identification of such a problem is too complicated and it is easier to make the correction now?",

Identifying the root cause of issues like this is not trivial, but is not super hard too.\r\nI would like to, **gradually**, update the instances in `CachedReflectionInfo`, which work with public instance or static members of public types, to use the overload of `GetMethod/GetProperty` that require the parameter type argument. It's by no means an urgent work.\r\n\r\nBut I want us to be more future proof on this, meaning that when reviewing code, spot `GetMethod(string)` or similar that are called on public types, and use the more explicit overload instead.",
