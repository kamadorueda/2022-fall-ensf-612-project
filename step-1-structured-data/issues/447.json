      "body": "So what's going on here is that the default TERMs on OS X expect `^?` to act as 'erase', which the `Delete` key on OS X sends. However, `System.Console` (and indeed, many other applications in my experience) interpret this on OS X as 'forward delete' instead of 'backspace' (aka 'erase').\n\nInterestingly, my Linux machine in various TERMs also use `^?` as 'erase', but interpret it correctly.\n",
