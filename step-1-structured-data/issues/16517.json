  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI created a Powershell script for automated updating and writing of a C header file. I use Get-Content -Raw (Which is a whole different can of worms, as to why 'Raw' is not implicit), then I use regex and finally I use Set-Content to write back to my file. In doing so, I noticed an ever-growing list of newlines at the end of my header file and as it turned out, Set-Content automatically appends a newline at the end of its contents and one must explicitly add `-NoNewLine` to avoid this. My question is, why is this the default? Is this not considered non-standard behavior? In what use case would an automatic newline append be desired?\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nMake the -NoNewLine parameter of Set-Content implicit, instead replace it with a parameter for explicit newline addition, i.e. -NewLine / -AddNewLine",
