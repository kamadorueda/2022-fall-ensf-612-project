The `Test-Connection` tests on macOS seem to have been flaky for some time.\r\n- Do we think there's some way we could improve the way the CI instance is configured to mitigate?\r\n- Otherwise, is there some other way we could perform test setup here that wouldn't hit this issue? Or possibly we could identify when we've hit this issue and handle it somehow?\r\n\r\n/cc @JamesWTruher @SteveL-MSFT @iSazonov ",

      "body": "I don't have high hopes for this. There are _tons_ of issues with the cmdlet on both MacOS and Linux, mainly because the basic .NET API for pings and just pretty much everything is... incomplete at best, and completely broken in some cases. (Try running a trace on Unix with the cmdlet; 99% of the data is unusable.) I filed an issue on the main ones that bothered me as I was (re)writing parts of the cmdlet last time around, and it's been largely ignored.\r\n\r\nAt best, it looks like the .NET team don't have the more barebones networking APIs high on the priority list.",
