  "body": "Suppose I have devised some magical command line, e.g.\r\ngci -recurse *.php | select name, Directory, LastWriteTime | sort lastwritetime\r\n\r\nAnd now I have list of files and paths in front of me, it would be useful to be able to click or ctrl+click on the powershell window to open the path in file explorer. \r\n\r\nOpen question is how it should behave if I ctrl click a file path (vs. directory path) should it give options to open the file or browse to the path?\r\n\r\nI think command Ctrl+Click is somewhat defacto e.g. for URLs in other programs like nutty etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for considering.",
