I don't have the link handy right now, but it's been looked at, and I believe there were some regressions in .NET Core that needed to be patched. From memory, it should be functional within a few more preview releases of .NET Core (I think they ballparked it at preview8 of .NET Core 3).\r\n\r\nI think @corbob might know where that issue thread was at, it was in either the AD commands repo or the .NET Core repo...",

If not, I'll give it another look when his PR is merged :)",
