  "body": "This seems to be a bug only in Win32-OpenSSH ssh.exe client, so I'll create an issue there as well.  When the client prompts for host authenticity ssh.exe writes an error in StdErr with a blank message string.  Currently PowerShell SSH remoting treats any StdErr from ssh.exe client as a terminating error and terminates the transport connection.  This does not repro on a Linux client but only on Windows using Win32-OpenSSH.\n\nThe fix in PowerShell SSH remoting is to ignore all blank error messages from StdErr.\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n``` powershell\nPS C:\\> del C:\\users\\<user>\\.ssh\\known_hosts\nPS C:\\> New-PSSession -HostName $env:computername -UserName userName\nThe authenticity of host 'computer' can't be established.\nECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:AeRUkqd3vJjZDNI07Do4BBpmutic4UR35bKw3FBV6a4.\nAre you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?\nWarning: Permanently added 'computer' to the list of known hosts.\n\nNew-PSSession : [computer] The background process reported an error with the following message: The SSH client session has\nended with no error message..\nAt line:1 char:1\n+ New-PSSession -HostName $env:computername -user userName\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n    + CategoryInfo          : OpenError: (System.Manageme....RemoteRunspace:RemoteRunspace) [New-PSSession], PSRemotin\n   gTransportException\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : 2100,PSSessionOpenFailed\n```\n## Expected behavior\n\nNo error after adding target computer to trusted hosts list.\n## Actual behavior\n\nError and connection termination.\n",

I neglected to mention that the workaround is to simply run the New-PSSession Cmdlet a second time and the connection will succeed (since the host has been added to the trusted list).\n\nIf you are interested the fix is at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/fanin/OutOfProcTransportManager.cs\nline 1526 needs to change:\n\n```\nif (string.IsNullOrEmpty(error))\n{\n    // Ignore blank error messages.\n    continue;\n}\nif (error.IndexOf(\"WARNING:\", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) > -1)\n...\n```\n",
