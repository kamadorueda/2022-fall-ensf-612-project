  "body": "When a TypeTable is created it includes the types from type files provided along with references to the type files.  When the InitialSessionState (ISS) object processes these types it reads the type files again and ends up with duplicate type entries.  PowerShell V5.1 ISS type processing was re-written to improve performance and no longer removes duplicate types, so that this scenario (runspace ISS reuse) results in errors causing a regression.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to copy only type data when a TypeTable is passed to the ISS.",
