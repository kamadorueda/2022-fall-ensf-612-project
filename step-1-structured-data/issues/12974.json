  "body": "I've been attempting to install posh-git on my new system, however installs keep failing with \r\n\r\n```\r\nWARNING: Source Location 'https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2/package/posh-git/0.7.3' is not valid.\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith some more testing, it appears that any download with PowerShellGet fails. I wonder if this has something to do with NuGet removing TLS 1.1 and prior support as of 6/15/2020. However, setting TLS 1.2 explicitly with `[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12` doesn't seem to work. Is there something else that needs to get ran to force TLS 1.2? I can download the files using a web browser however.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. `PowerShellGet\\Install-Module posh-git -Scope CurrentUser -AllowPrerelease -Force`\r\n2. Thats it, the above will fail saying the source location is not valid.",
