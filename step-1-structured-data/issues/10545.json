  "body": "# Import-Module ShadowCopy\r\n\r\nI'm currently developing some cmdlets in c#/.net and its really annoying to close the pwsh window when i have to recompile the cmdlet's assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn additional parameter for \"Import-Module\" would be awesome. \r\nName. -ShadowCopy\r\n\r\nThis command should copy the '*.dll' to the system temp folder with a new random name to bypass the file lock which is active till the end of the powershell session. Even Remove-Module does not release the lock.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition a filesystem watcher would be cool, which monitors the dll for changes and reloads the module when changed.",

      "body": "@J-kit This looks like duplication. Please use GitHub search to find some issues (with large discussions) about module reloading and assembly unloading. So far, we have not found how this can be implemented. Your proposal looks like a workaround that is not suitable for implementation in the engine, but you could embed it in your build process. We use something like in our Pester tests.\r\n",
