  "body": "Hey @vors:\n\nI guess they updated how dependencies are supposed to be specified. The oddity we see where the lock files complain about needing to be restored even after a restore (like [here](https://travis-ci.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/builds/20780608#L2426)) _may_ be due to our use of `frameworkAssemblies`, as discuessed in dotnet/cli#1171.\n\nI think all we need to do is remove any version specified under framework assemblies. I'll give it a whack.\n",
