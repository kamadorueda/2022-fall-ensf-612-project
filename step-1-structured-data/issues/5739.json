You can install v2 from the [gallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSReadline/2.0.0-beta1).\r\n\r\nI think the version in this repo will be removed in favor of pulling my version from the gallery, so if you still see issues, I suggest you submit a PR there instead.\r\n\r\nThe change to `ConsoleControl.cs` does make sense in this repo though, so we should merge that for sure.\r\n\r\n",
