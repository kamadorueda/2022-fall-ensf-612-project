[..] this is why, by the way, you'll never see the ISE open sourced that I'm aware of, because it's based around this control that is based on source that is closed source from Microsoft and it's closed source because the people who own it don't want to maintain it and support third parties in the open source, so we're kind of stuck with this boat anchor. So. VS Code!.\r\n\r\n- Bruce Payette's \"A Historical Architectural Tour of PowerShell\" talk from PS Conf EU, here https://youtu.be/tQic7z75O6Y?t=6085\r\n\r\n\r\n",
