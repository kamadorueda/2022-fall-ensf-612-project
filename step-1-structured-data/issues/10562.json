  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6?view=powershell-6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\nThere is a PowerShell module at work which has a MAML help file (.dll-Help.xml). While the help content seemed to show up okay for some colleagues, it did not show up well for me. I would see content like:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPS C:\\Users\\jazzdelightsme> open-foo -?\r\n\r\nNAME\r\n    Open-Foo\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS\r\n    Opens a new connection to a foo.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNTAX\r\n    Open-Foo [-FooName] <string> [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n    Open-Foo [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n    Open-Foo [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n    Open-Foo [<CommonParameters>]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION\r\n    Lorem ipsum dolor blah blah blah ...\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATED LINKS\r\n\r\nREMARKS\r\n    To see the examples, type: \"get-help Open-Foo -examples\".\r\n    For more information, type: \"get-help Open-Foo -detailed\".\r\n    For technical information, type: \"get-help Open-Foo -full\".\r\n\r\n\r\nPS C:\\Users\\jazzdelightsme>\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter some troubleshooting, I found that this was due to the fact that I `Set-StrictMode -Version Latest` in my `$profile` script. It turns out there is some script run during formatting of help output, and the MAML was perhaps not as complete as it should be. I discovered clues in `$error`, like:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThe property 'required' cannot be found on this object. Verify that the property exists.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ $optional = $_.required -ne 'true'\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n+ CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], PropertyNotFoundException\r\n+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : PropertyNotFoundStrict\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis can be worked around by filling out the MAML a bit more, but it is rather large, and hand-tweaking MAML is not my idea of a good time. (I'm not sure if the MAML was originally hand-crafted, or some tool was used, or what, but it's quite old.)\r\n\r\nPerhaps help formatting could be upgraded to be more tolerant of StrictMode errors?\r\n\r\nIn fact, it seems that *some* help formatting script already does this. See [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/4af3068566b2218bc37ea19785ded589c2a5c42f/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/DefaultFormatters/HelpV3_format_ps1xml.cs#L127)--the script includes a call to `Set-StrictMode -Off`:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    var RelatedLinksHelpInfoControl = CustomControl.Create()\r\n            .StartEntry()\r\n                .StartFrame(leftIndent: 4)\r\n                    .AddScriptBlockExpressionBinding(StringUtil.Format(@\"Set-StrictMode -Off\r\nif (($_.relatedLinks -ne $()) -and ($_.relatedLinks.navigationLink -ne $()) -and ($_.relatedLinks.navigationLink.Length -ne 0))\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also: #6497\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18985\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
