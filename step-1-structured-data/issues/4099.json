  "body": "Is there any guidance on the behaviour of various verbs? I was surprised that I couldn't find anything, as I would have that that behavioural consistency across verbs would be useful for users of PowerShell.\r\n\r\nAs an example, here are two questions that I'd love answered for my pshosts module:\r\n\r\n- Should `Get` cmdlets always return an error when the item is not found and a wildcard pattern was not provided? (pshosts currently emits an error)\r\n- Is it acceptable for a `Set` cmdlets to create the item if it does not already exist? If not, would it be acceptable behind a `-Force` flag? (pshosts raises an error if the item does not exist, and Force has no effect on this behaviour)",

If so we should update it by results the discussion.\r\n\r\nMy understanding is that cmdlet behavior should be based on underline API behavior and our common expectations. Usually we expect that \"Get\" return an existing object, \"New\" creates an object and \"Set\" only changes existing object.",

      "body": "Good point RE `Get`. I guess I should add a `Test` verb to check for existence.\r\n\r\nThe `Set` issue is a little more nuanced. In my scenario, `Set-HostEntry something.local -Loopback` feels like it should just set the local hosts entry even if that means adding one. The AWS SDK (which, granted, doesn't always provide the best example of PS conventions) tends to match this behaviour in things like `Set-DefaultAWSRegion` and `Set-AWSCrentials`.\r\n",
