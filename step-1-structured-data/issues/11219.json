An example of a workaround for this is described [here](https://gaelcolas.com/2017/11/05/pseudo-splatting-dsc-resources/).\r\n\r\nThe desired outcome would be to be able to do something like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$MyHashes = @(\r\n  @{\r\n    Ensure  = 'Present'\r\n    Name    = 'Putty'\r\n    Version = 'Latest'\r\n    ChocolateyOptions = @{ source = 'https://chocolatey.org/api/v2/' }\r\n  },\r\n  @{\r\n    Ensure  = 'Absent'\r\n    Name    = 'notepadplusplus'\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n\r\nConfiguration MyDscConfig {\r\n    $Allnodes.nodename {\r\n        foreach($MyHash in $MyHashes) {\r\n            ChocolateyPackage $MyHash['name'] @MyHash\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```",
