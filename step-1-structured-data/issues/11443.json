  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nI feel like this leans on the bug category... but I suppose it is a feature...\r\n\r\nToday, you can't use `-HostName` and `-JobName` together in the same call to `Invoke-Command`.\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS > Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { gci } -AsJob -HostName localhost -JobName foo\r\nInvoke-Command: Parameter set cannot be resolved using the specified named parameters. One or more parameters issued cannot be used together or an insufficient number of parameters were provided.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce I get rid of `-JobName` it works:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS > Invoke-Command -ScriptBlock { gci } -AsJob -HostName localhost\r\n\r\nId     Name            PSJobTypeName   State         HasMoreData     Location             Command\r\n--     ----            -------------   -----         -----------     --------             -------\r\n5      Job5            RemoteJob       Running       True            localhost             gci\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nCould this be as easy as allowing `JobName` parameter with this parameter set?",
