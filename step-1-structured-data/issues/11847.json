  "body": "`Compare-Object` only reports _differences_ by default, requiring explicit opt-in for inclusion of _equal_ objects via `-IncludeEqual`.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the only meaningful behavior when you use `-ExcludeDifferent` is to _default_ to `-IncludeEqual`.\r\n\r\nWithout that, as is currently the case, _nothing_ is ever output, so it is currently effectively pointless to pass `-ExcludeDifferent` _without also passing `-IncludeEqual`_.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nCompare-Object 1,2 3, 1 -ExcludeDifferent -PassThru -IncludeEqual  | Should -Be 1\r\n# Currently produces NO output, because -IncludeEqual isn't implied.\r\nCompare-Object 1,2 3, 1 -ExcludeDifferent -PassThru | Should -Be 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nBoth tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe 2nd test fails, because `-IncludeEqual` is not implied.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-rc.2\r\n```\r\n",
