  "body": "<sup>Note: `cmd.exe`'s `rd /s` and .NET's  `[System.IO.Directory]::Delete()` are equally affected: see [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/console/issues/309) and [here](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33603).</sup>\r\n\r\nNote: The problem occurs only on _Windows_ (and there also on _Windows PowerShell_).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n_Update_: \r\n\r\n**Starting with Windows 10 version `1909`, (at least) build `18363.657` (I don't know that Windows _Server_  version and build that corresponds to; run `winver.exe` to check your version and build), the `DeleteFile` Windows API function now exhibits _synchronous_ behavior, which implicitly solves the  problems with PowerShell's `Remove-Item` and .NET's `System.IO.File.Delete` / `System.IO.Directory.Delete` (but, curiously, _not_ with `cmd.exe`'s `rd /s`).** \r\n\r\nThus, only older Windows 10 versions and older Windows versions in general are affected.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**The Windows API functions  `DeleteFile()` and  `RemoveDirectory()` functions are _inherently asynchronous_** (emphasis added):\r\n\r\n> The DeleteFile function **marks a file for deletion** on close. Therefore, the file **deletion does not occur until the last handle to the file is closed**. Subsequent calls to CreateFile to open the file fail with ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.\"\r\n\r\n> The RemoveDirectory function **marks a directory for deletion on close**. Therefore, the directory is **not removed until the last handle to the directory is closed.**\"\r\n\r\nPowerShell fails to account for this asynchronous behavior, which has two implications:\r\n\r\n* Problem (a): **Trying to delete a nonempty directory (which invariably requires recursive deletion of its _content_ first) may _fail_** - infrequently, but it does happen.\r\n\r\n* Problem (b): **Trying to _recreate_ a successfully deleted directory or a file _immediately afterwards_ may fail** - intermittently (easier to provoke than the other problem, but a more exotic use case overall).\r\n   * Note: You could argue that it's not PowerShell's responsibility to create a synchronous experience in this case, given that the underlying system API is asynchronous; however, it certainly makes for more robust, predictable scripting if synchronicity is ensured.\r\n\r\nAs an aside: `cmd.exe`'s `rd /s` exhibits the same problem, [as does .NET Core's `[System.IO.Directory]::Delete()`](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/33603) (which PowerShell does _not_ use).\r\n\r\nProblem (a) is due to using depth-first recursion without accounting for the asynchronous deletion behavior; the problem, along with the solution, is described in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/uhRWMGBjlO8?t=455) (starts at 7:35).\r\n\r\nImportant: \r\n\r\n* The repros below use the functions defined at the bottom, which must be defined first.\r\n* The tests created temp. dir. `$HOME/tmpdir` - remove it manually afterwards, if still present.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nSetup: Paste and submit the function definitions below at the prompt.\r\n\r\nProblem (a):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nAssert-ReliableDirRemoval ps\r\n```\r\n\r\nProblem (b):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nAssert-SyncDirRemoval ps\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe functions should loop _indefinitely_ (terminate them with `Ctrl+C`), emitting a `.` in each iteration.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n**_Eventually_** - and that there is no _predictable_ time frame is indicative of the problem - an error will occur, on the **order of _minutes_ or even longer**.\r\n\r\nProblem (a):\r\n\r\n```none\r\nReliable dir-tree-removal test: Repeatedly creating and removing a directory subtree, using ps for removal.\r\n.........Remove-Item : Directory C:\\Users\\jdoe\\tmpDir\\sub\\sub cannot be removed because it is not empty.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, recursive removal of the target dir's _content_ failed due to async timing issues.\r\n\r\nProblem (b):\r\n\r\n```none\r\nSynchronous dir-removal test: Repeatedly creating and removing a directory, using ps for removal.\r\n.................New-Item : An item with the specified name C:\\Users\\jdoe\\tmpDir already exists.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat is, recreating the target dir failed, because the prior removal hadn't yet completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAux. function definitions:\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n###  Functions `Assert-ReliableDirRemoval` and `Assert-SyncDirRemoval`\r\n\r\nYou can paste the entire code at the prompt in order to define these functions.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Assert-ReliableDirRemoval {\r\n  param([parameter(Mandatory)] [ValidateSet('cmd', '.net', 'ps')] [string] $method)\r\n  Write-Host \"Reliable dir-tree-removal test: Repeatedly creating and removing a directory subtree, using $method for removal.\"\r\n  # Treat all errors as fatal.\r\n  $ErrorActionPreference = 'Stop'\r\n  Set-Location $HOME  # !!

One of the ways I worked around it was:\r\n\r\n    Get-ChildItem $Path -Recurse | Sort-Object -Property FullName -Descending | Remove-Item\r\n\r\nThe sorting simply ensures that children are passed before parents and leafs before containers.

Unfortunately, guaranteeing a file is deleted on Windows can sometimes be complicated, as this issue shows.\r\n\r\nIn general, `Remove-Item -Recurse` will do the job. In large / complex directory structures, it could potentially fail in some cases to remove everything due to how Windows itself handles file deletion. The purpose of this issue is to discuss ways we can attempt to handle that and seek a more thorough solution.",
