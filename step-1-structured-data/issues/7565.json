Number of items in a partition\r\n2. Total number of partitions.  \r\n\r\nTotal number of partitions is arguably better for parallel execution since you can number your partitions to match the number of cores on your machine e.g. on a 4-core machine:\r\n```powershell\r\n# count words in 'Way and Peace'\r\n[System.IO.File]::ReadAllLines(\"WarAndPeace.txt\").\r\n    PartitionData(4).\r\n        foreachparallel{\r\n            (-split $_).\r\n                 Count}.\r\n                      Sum()\r\n```\r\n@mazzy-ax  Is this your scenario? Or do you have other things in mind? If so, please share.",

Note however, that once you have `Task` support, it can also be implemented as a script method:\r\n```powershell\r\nUpdate-TypeData -TypeName Object -Force -MemberType ScriptMethod -MemberName foreachparallel  -Value {\r\n    param ([scriptblock] $body)\r\n\r\n    $p = [linq.parallelenumerable]::AsParallel(@($this))\r\n    [linq.parallelenumerable]::Select($p, [func[object,object]] $body)\r\n}\r\n``` \r\n`foreachparallel` wouldn't be available in Restricted language but it might be there in Constrained language as long as we can ensure there are no security holes (e.g. language mode would have to propagate into Tasks created by PLINQ)..",
