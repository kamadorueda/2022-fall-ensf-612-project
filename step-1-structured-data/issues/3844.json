  "body": "Address #2900\r\n\r\nRoot Cause\r\n------------\r\nOn Unix platforms, we are currently depending on `xdg-open` on Linux and `open` on OSX to open the default program for a registered file type, so the file path is served as an argument to `xdg-open` and `open`. However, we didn't handle the case when path contains spaces.\r\n\r\nFix\r\n---\r\nUse the method `NativeCommandParameterBinder.NeedQuotes`, which is used by powershell native command processor, to check if quote is needed. If yes, add quotes in the same way as our native command processor (see the code [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/NativeCommandParameterBinder.cs#L198)).\r\nThere is another problem with the current `Invoke-Item` on Linux and OSX -- it cannot invoke an executable properly. The fix is to first run `Process.Start` directly with the file path, and if it fails, then try `xdg-open` or `open`.",
