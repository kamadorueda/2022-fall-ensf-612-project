  "body": "When a PS class is defined in a module and the module gets reloaded, the class would still use the SessionState from the old module for execution, and thus it doesn't reflect changes to the module state during the reload. This fix is to make sure we always use the current EngineSessionState for PS class execution. Fix one (out of three) issue discussed in #2505\r\n\r\n~~Also remove one additional unneeded block.~~ This was taken care of by #2833",
