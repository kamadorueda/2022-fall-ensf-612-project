      "body": "Just a side note `Add-Printer` ships with Windows as part of Windows PowerShell 5, it's in the `PrintManagement `module under  `C:\\Windows\\system32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\Modules`  so isn't looked after as part of this repo.\r\n\r\nIt's a cim-cmdlet and looking inside the function that's created there's a \"Supports Should Process\" at the top but no \"Should process\" code in it - somewhere a setting is missing in `MSFT_Printer_v1.0.cdxml`  which defines the CIM cmdlet, I'm not clued up enough on the XML schema for these to things to know what it is, but some of the MSFT folk here will know, and hopefully will have contacts in the right group to get the fix made. \r\n\r\n",
