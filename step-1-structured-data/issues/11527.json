      "body": "So far, from what I have seen, I\u2019m not very optimistic for results here in this repository. Since the bot has the entire GitHub as it\u2019s data set, one single person rating a deduction incorrectly throws off the entire data set by a bit.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it, and we should most likely stick with issue templates which now have support for adding labels based on which template you use.  If there is a self host option for it, that would most likely work 100x better because it will only be collecting powershell data - but the current hosted one is a no from me.  Of course, this is just my opinion, but I think it should be taken under consideration. ",
