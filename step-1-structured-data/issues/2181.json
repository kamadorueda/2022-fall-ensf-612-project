  "body": "I tried using Powershell to listen to the `Dismissed` event of a `ToastNotification` as follows:\n\n``` powershell\n$toast = [Windows.UI.Notifications.ToastNotification]::new( ... )\n$notifier = [Windows.UI.Notifications.ToastNotificationManager]::CreateToastNotifier( ... )\n$notifier.Show($toast)\n\nRegister-ObjectEvent -InputObject $toast -EventName Dismissed -Action { ... }\n```\n\nRunning this code, however, fails with the following exception message: \n`Windows PowerShell cannot subscribe to Windows RT events.`\n\nTherefore, I'd like to ask:\n- Does a workaround exist to subscribe to Windows RT events from Powershell?\n- Is there another way to query the current state or final result of a `ToastNotification` (i.e. whether it is `Activated`, `Dismissed`, or `Failed`) from Powershell? \n\nAny help is much appreciated.\n",
