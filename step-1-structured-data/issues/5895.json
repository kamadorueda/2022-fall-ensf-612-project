In cmd:\r\n`msiexec /i Path/To/PowerShell-X.Y.Z.0-x64.msi /q`\r\nOr in PowerShell:\r\n` & Path/To/PowerShell-X.Y.Z.0-x64.msi /q`\r\nThis will install it in the background. See [this](https://kevinmarquette.github.io/2016-10-21-powershell-installing-msi-files/) blog post for more advanced scenarios if you want to block the shell until the installation has finished.",
