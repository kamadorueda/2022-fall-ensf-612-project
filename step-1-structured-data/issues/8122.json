However, neither the readme, nor the dpkg output, nor any online documentation I could find made this clear. This was definitiely a case of not knowing what I was looking for. Could you please add some more references to this change?",

I think visibility on this can be added in places where it would be obvious for the people who think they know what they are doing, or at least the README? (The obvious places to find the name of the executable are in the README or the \"getting started\" documentation linked from the README, but the executable name appears in neither location.)",
