Just like filename of other download formats, Appimage filename should also include version",

The Linux releases are consistent with Fedora guidelines (for example) which say that they SHOULD be lowercase, while AppImage appears to have adopted Pascal casing (along with Windows).  I'll add the `version` to the AppImage filename, but not make any changes to the casing.",
