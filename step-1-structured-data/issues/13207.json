  "body": "I'd like to be able to look at the output of a cmdlet, and then `select` some of the property names I see. The formating data for `Get-Volume` presents the property `FileSystemLabel` as `FriendlyName`, and then `select FriendlyName` doesn't work; it is not clear how to get from the presented name to the real name.\r\n\r\nFeature request: Present it as `FileSystemLabel`, it's clear, helpful, and matches terminology elsewhere in Windows (`diskpart` and `gcim Win32_Volume` call it \"Label\", not Friendly Name, for example).\r\n",
