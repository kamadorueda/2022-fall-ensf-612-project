This will include to **create to ssh port rule**, **properly configure the sshd_config file** with all needed enabled lines, and  **adding the Subsystem PowerShell Core path**.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep in mind, that the latest version of Windows 10 (I think greater than 14393, and specially Insider Version) will include the OpenSSH client ready to go.  And, in  those version, the OpenSSH Server need to be installed separately.\r\n\r\nI can tell you that everything work as expected, and specially with the latest PowerShell Core 6.1.0-Preview.3. \r\n\r\n:)",
