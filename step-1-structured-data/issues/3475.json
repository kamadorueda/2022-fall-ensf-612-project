  "body": "This is a change request to add optional ```[-Port <int>]``` parameter to the following version of the New-PSSession commandlet\r\n\r\n```\r\nNew-PSSession [-HostName] <string[]> [-Name <string[]>] [-UserName <string>] [-KeyFilePath <string>] [-SSHTransport] [-[Port <int>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Use Case\r\nThe use case is opening a remote session over SSH into a Widows 10 machine. The default SSH port is 22, but if the Developer Mode is enabled on the target machine that port is already assigned to \u201cSSH Server Broker\u201d and \u201cSSH Server Proxy\u201d services installed with that mode. To make PowerShell work with OpenSSH one needs to stop those services manually, or turn the Developer Mode off, on the target machine. OpenSSH can be configured to use any open port, but the current implementation of the New-PSSession uses the default port 22. \r\n\r\nWe should have an option to instruct PowerShell to use a non-default port while creating a remote session to specific host.\r\n\r\n## Corollary\r\nFrom what I see when trying to open a remote session from a Debian machine to a Windows 10 machine with \u201cSSH Server Broker\u201d and \u201cSSH Server Proxy\u201d services running, the PowerShell hangs the entire terminal session on the calling/Debian machine.    \r\n\r\nWojtek",
