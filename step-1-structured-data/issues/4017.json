  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nIf it is a bug report:\r\n- make sure you are able to repro it on the latest released version. \r\nYou can install the latest version from https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](../docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](../docs/KNOWNISSUES.md).\r\n- Fill out the following repro template\r\n\r\nIf it's not a bug, please remove the template and elaborate the issue in your own words.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n In C:\\temp folder create new folder whose name consists only of [non-breaking space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space). You can type NBSP with holding alt and pressing 0160 on numerical keyboard. After creating it, run\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-ChildItem C:\\Temp\\ -Recurse\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nIt should list folder only once.\r\n```none\r\nd-----        6/15/2017   2:20 PM\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nyou will get endless list of folders without name, although there exists only one such folder.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nd-----        6/15/2017   2:20 PM\r\nd-----        6/15/2017   2:20 PM\r\nd-----        6/15/2017   2:20 PM\r\nd-----        6/15/2017   2:20 PM\r\nd-----        6/15/2017   2:20 PM\r\n. . . \r\n```\r\n\r\nI have tried this on Desktop and Server environments, and with PowerShell 4 and 5. Command Get-Item is having also issue with this name, and both switches -Path and -LiteralPath are behaving in the same way. It was confirmed by multiple [persons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44567844/get-childitem-and-non-breaking-space). Running DIR /S in CMD works as expected.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.14393.1198\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.14393.1198\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "I was further tracking down this behavior.  Get-ChildItem is just calling provider, so that's not where the problem is, but in PSProvider FileSystem. Checking the code there, I saw that problem seems to originate from Get-Item. And even further, it comes from **[IO.DirectoryInfo]** constructor. This one is trimming trailing spaces (including NBSP), which in this case is wrong.\r\n\r\nIn the above listed example (NBSP folder inside of c:\\temp), run these three commands:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n$nbsp = (gci c:\\temp).Fullname \r\n# gets the full name of problem folder\r\n\r\n$nbsp.ToCharArray() | % {write-host $_ [byte]($_)} \r\n# lists all chars from name and their ascii values\r\n# we can see trailing NBSP\r\n\r\n[IO.DirectoryInfo]::new($nbsp)  \r\n# this returns wrong folder 'temp' and not the one with NBSP name\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan someone with more experience recheck this?",
