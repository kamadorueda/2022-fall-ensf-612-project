If the target web service (like GitHub) has throttling, it can hit this after a few pages and fail.  Haven't thought this through if it should be tied to `-Retry` (https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/5582) or separate.\r\n\r\nPerhaps just a `-EnableThrottling` used with `-Retry` that uses some logarithmic backoff timeout if specific error codes are received from the server.
