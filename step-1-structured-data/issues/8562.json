It's not always the easiest thing to determine with certainty, but a general bucket of \"this should be relatively straightforward to figure out\" would be a good idea. \r\n\r\nThat said... if you ever _are_ out of your depth, I've noted in the past that simply opening an issue or commenting on an existing issue and asking for some assistance or general guidance is pretty well received here. Most of the time, the contributors and the PS team are pretty willing to help get you past anywhere you might get stuck. \ud83d\ude04 ",
