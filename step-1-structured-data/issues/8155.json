  "body": "Experimental feature flags is new to PSCore6.1.  We are starting to have some features implemented behind the experimental flag.  Currently, you have to pass `-ListAvailable` to `Get-ExperimentalFeature` to all the features and not just the enabled ones.  For users new to experimental features, this seems non-obvious and it appears that there are no experimental features which limits how much feedback we can get.  I would suggest removing the need for `-ListAvailable` as the user can easily filter enabled vs disabled ones.\r\n\r\nAfter the user sees the available features, it's not obvious how to update their PowerShell settingsfile to enable the feature.  They need to add something like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n            {\r\n                \"ExperimentalFeatures\": [\r\n                  \"PSUseAbbreviationExpansion\",\r\n\t\t  \"PSImplicitRemotingBatching\"\r\n                ]\r\n            }\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo their config file.  Seems like we need to add support for user config files instead of just system wide.  A cmdlet to enable features (which message indicating the features are enabled after restart of PowerShell) as well as disabling features.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0-preview.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0-preview.1-43-g66a4ab10a9c33d0a1e7daef9a8cb6ba881e8de02\r\nOS                             Darwin 18.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 18.0.0: Wed Aug 22 20:13:40 PDT 2018; root:xnu-4903.201.2~1/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
