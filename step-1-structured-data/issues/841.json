  "body": "When running PowerShell Core on Nano, the `Clear-Host` command fails due to an unsupported `System.Console.SetBufferContents` call.\n\nI think the fix would be to modify the function to just call `cls.exe` directly, and catch any errors around `System.Console`.\n\nThe [current implementation](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/76ad94d8a760cd3f865e2dcb151287ce33e0cd5d/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/InitialSessionState.cs#L4725) clears the host manually with calls to `$RawUI.SetBufferContents`.\n",
