  "body": "# Summary\r\n\r\nI'd think Expand-Archive is one of the heavily used cmdlets in various installation scripts. But currently you still need   to do a lot of unnecessary things like:\r\n- save temp archive file\r\n- remove temp archive\r\n- [in some cases] move files from the root catalog to some other folder\r\n- Also, it doesn't work with tarballs (big deal for linux)\r\n\r\nI think we should make Expand-Archive to pull archive directly from url avoiding writing/removing stuff on your disc. I guess that is not that hard to build some custom cmdlet, but I believe this should come out of the box, so installation script can rely on it.\r\n\r\n### Example:\r\n\r\nI need nodejs binaries in my project. I want to put this in \"node\" subfolder (but not in something like node-v10.16.3-linux-x64 ). In bash this could be achived this way:\r\n``` bash\r\nmkdir ./node\r\nwget -qO- https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-x64.tar.xz | tar --transform 's/^dbt2-0.37.50.3/dbt2/' -xvz -C ./node --strip=1\r\n```\r\n### Desired powershell functionality:\r\n``` powershell\r\n$url = https://nodejs.org/dist/v10.16.3/node-v10.16.3-linux-x64.tar.gz\r\nExpand-Archive -Uri $url -type targz -Destination ./node -Strip -Force -Verbose\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think many other core cmdlets with -Path parameter would benefit from  such thing too. Maybe  we can make Path to understand paths with http:// prefix. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Maybe if Expand-Archive support pipeline, we can get the desired result: \"extract archive without first saving to filesystem\". Inspired by Unix-y tools:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nURL=https://github.com/dotnet/docs/archive/master.tar.gz\r\n\r\n# wget\r\nwget -qO- $URL | tar -xvz > /dev/null\r\n\r\n# curl\r\ncurl -sSL $URL | tar -xvz > /dev/null\r\n```\r\n\r\nit would be great if we could do something like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n(Invoke-WebRequest $URL).Content | Expand-Archive -DestinationPath docs-master\r\n```\r\n\r\nor better yet, streaming:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nInvoke-WebRequest -EmitContentToStdOut $URL| Expand-Archive -DestinationPath docs-master\r\n```",
