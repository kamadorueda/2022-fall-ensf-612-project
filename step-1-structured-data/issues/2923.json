  "body": "The `Out-File` command has a mandatory `-FilePath` parameter. The name of the `-FilePath` parameter is a bit redundant, given that the command's noun is `File`. I'd recommend adding a parameter alias `-Path` to the `-FilePath` parameter, to remove the requirement to have this redundancy.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n**Trevor Sullivan**\r\nDocker Captain\r\nMicrosoft MVP: Cloud & Data Center Management\r\nhttps://trevorsullivan.net\r\nhttps://twitter.com/pcgeek86",

      "body": "FWIW- It's not an accident that Out-File uses -FilePath instead of Path. It was intended that commands which take -Path should work against any provider supporting the underlying operations. Out-File explicitly and only works against the file system hence -FilePath instead of the more general -Path.",
