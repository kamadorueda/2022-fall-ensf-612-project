      "body": "### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThe obsolete parameters should be marked obsolete **via documentation** (and hidden if possible from tab completion) but not removed (since they don't break things, and removing them _might_ break existing scripts).\r\n\r\nOptionally, when a value is provided, the cmdlet can output a warning that these fields don't work correctly in modern PowerShell. NOTE: this is for `DotnetFrameworkVersion` and `CLRVersion` which legitimately don't work. \r\n\r\nFinally, I think it would be great if we could _not_ put the commented out text for these in the psd1 (when there's no value passed in to the parameter).\r\n\r\n\r\n> What about ProcessorArchitecture?\r\n> \r\n> [#18320 (comment)](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/18320#issuecomment-1281786821)\r\n\r\nSurely there are PowerShell modules that don't/only work on ARM? But I don't know if this one _works_ or not. \r\n\r\nHowever, at the very least, I think it would be useful to have all the parameters that are rarely used _and_ are complicated to get right ... just _not output_ in the PSD1 unless they have a value. The commented out lines aren't useful. That's at least these:\r\n- ProcessorArchitecture\r\n- PowerShellHostName\r\n- PowerShellHostVersion\r\n- FileList\r\n- DefaultCommandPrefix",
