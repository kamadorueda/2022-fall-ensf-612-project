UltraEdit\r\n\r\nSo applications seem to have some control over it, though I'm not sure how they interface with the relevant APIs.\r\n\r\nWith Windows Terminal, I just edited the settings.json file to specify Roboto Mono.

Applications not using Windows' own conhost can handle fonts however they like... but as far as I'm aware, using conhost means you essentially have to take what you're given when it comes to fonts. Windows Terminal uses conpty (a newer implementation that IIRC is also developed by the Windows Terminal team) rather than the older conhost.\r\n\r\nPowerShell operates _within_ a terminal rather than being a terminal in and of itself... so it's beholden to whatever rules the terminal itself sets in terms of fonts etc.",
