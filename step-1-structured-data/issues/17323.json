Unfortunately it works only then the file is named with ps1 extension. \r\n\r\nWhy is that?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS > ./test\r\n/tmp\r\nPS > ./test.ps1\r\n/tmp\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS > ./test\r\n\r\nPS > ./test.ps1\r\n/tmp\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.3\r\nOS                             Linux 5.13.0-1023-azure #27~20.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 25 22:39:07 UTC 2022\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
