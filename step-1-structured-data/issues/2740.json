  "body": "PowerShell 5 now supports native (de)compression of zip files. It would be great if this could be extended to include:\r\n- .tar\r\n- .gz\r\n- .lzma / .7z\r\n- .bz2\r\n\r\n\r\nIdeally, this would function recursively so formats like .tar.gz get decompressed or created.  \r\n\r\nThis would make PowerShell better at handling archives from multiple systems.",
