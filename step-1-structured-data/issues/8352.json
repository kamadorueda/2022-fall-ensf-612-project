  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user I want to `Start-Process` with new environment variables.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nCurrently we do\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process PowerShell -ArgumentList '-Command',\"`$env:FOO='bar'; main.exe\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this is cumbersome. It would be great if we can specify some environment as argument to `Start-Process`, like\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process main.exe -Environment @{ FOO = 'bar' }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature request is related to #4671.
