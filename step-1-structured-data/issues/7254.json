I will therefore wait until the solution file has been fixed in master.\r\nEDIT: after some debugging/experimenting, it seems it was not the referenced PR but some other recently merged PR that breaks my branch in the sense that the XUnit project now does not load in VS any more.... The configuration changes in the references PR to the sln file should be still be re-reviewed though as they seem to be accidental.",
