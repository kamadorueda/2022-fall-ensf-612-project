  "body": "# Make Title and Message settable in Credential Attribute\n\nFor parity with Get-Credential, this exposes `Title` and `Message` properties in the Credential attribute, while maintaining the current behavior.\n\n## Requested by @potatoqualitee ...\nhttps://twitter.com/cl/status/1339896630863159296\n\nThe key feature request was to be able to customize the prompt for the password even when a username was being passed to the Credential parameter.\n\nNote: I've not touched any _tests_ here. If anyone who thinks something more should be done can point me in the right direction, I'm happy to do it.\n\n## PR Checklist\n\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\n    - [x] None\n    - **OR**\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\n- **User-facing changes**\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\n    - **OR**\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\n- **Testing - New and feature**\n    - [ ] N/A or can only be tested interactively\n    - **OR**\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\n- **Tooling**\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\n    - **OR**\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and enumerated concerns in the summary.
