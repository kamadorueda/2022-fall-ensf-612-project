Linux does this by creating a symbolic link.  We do it in the windows docker files by creating a symbolic link to the latest version.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nyou have to figure out the latest version\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "Currently on Windows, you have to do something like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nC:\\> c:\\pro<tab>\\pow<tab>\\6<tab>\\powershell\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd if you have multiple versions installed (which is currently the default), you have to tab through the older ones first (if you didn't uninstall them).  Would prefer something like:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nC:\\> c:\\pro<tab>\\pow<tab>\\l<tab>\\powershell\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can even save typing `l` for latest by having it `.latest` to ensure it's first.\r\n\r\nAnother pain point is that powershell.exe is third file to be tab completed under it's version folder.  Perhaps what we really need is something like `set-defaultpowershell` which creates/updates a symlink that is in the user path so `win+r->powershell` starts it.",
