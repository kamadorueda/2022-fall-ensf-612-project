  "body": "PR #12386 introduced _experimental_ feature `PSNativePSPathResolution`, which as of (at least) PowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.7 has become a _default_ feature.\r\n\r\n* For problems with this feature in general, see #13644\r\n\r\nIts purpose is to translate _PowerShell-drive-based_ paths to _native filesystem_ paths, because external executables only understand the latter.\r\n\r\nThis translation is currently overzealous in that it nonsensically translates an argument that _starts with `:`_ (which clearly isn't a _drive-based path_).\r\n\r\n@DHowett has pinpointed the problematic behavior to: https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/3effa204103460c996a8612aa70718fdf924047d/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/NativeCommandParameterBinder.cs#L388-L406\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn Unix:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n/bin/echo :foo | Should -Be ':foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn Windows:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncmd /c echo :foo | Should -Be ':foo'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, because the the current location's path is unexpectedly prepended to `:`\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nExpected strings to be the same, but they were different. Expected length: 4 Actual length:   44 Strings differ at index 0.\r\nExpected: ':foo' But was:  '/Users/jdoe...'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.7\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "I think we're missing the point here quite a bit tbh.\r\n\r\nThe problem that was originally raised on #13638 is that because we're looking for paths on all input parameters, we're breaking some use cases where an argument string is literally just `thing:thing` or even just `:thing` because PS is treating that as a relative path and it's being resolved to a full path. \r\n\r\n@DHowett's original example was:\r\n\r\n```\r\n& git log \":(top,exclude).git/\" \":(top,exclude)**/*.rec\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's not meant to be a _path_ in the same way that PowerShell tends to think of paths. Some of these need to passed along _without_ being resolved at all, not as a file name/directory name or anything. With PSNativePSPathResolution a standard feature, if PS thinks it's a relative path it's _resolving_ it to what it thinks the full path \"should\" be. Which means an argument like this will never be passed to the executable verbatim. Which is going to be endlessly problematic.\r\n\r\nIf we get `name1:name2` and `name1` isn't a recognised physical drive or PSDrive, IMO it should be passed along verbatim.",

      "body": "> If we get name1:name2 and name1 isn't a recognised physical drive or PSDrive, IMO it should be passed along verbatim.\r\n\r\nIndeed, @vexx32, and that is actually how it _mostly_ already works (except that action is only required for _PSDrives_, not native filesystem drives), with an argument-initial `:` constituting the only exception that amounts to a _bug_, as described in the OP.\r\n\r\nSo the bottom line is: An argument that _starts with `:`_ is by definition _not_ a path based on a PS drive and therefore no attempt should be made to translate it to a native path.\r\n\r\nNote, however, that that doesn't necessarily mean _verbatim_, because on Unix _globbing_ may still have to be performed on an (unquoted)  `:`-prefixed argument, given that there you may have, say, a subdir named `:foo` containing `.txt` files, which should be glob-expanded by something like `/bin/echo :foo/*.txt` (to pass individual arguments `:foo/bar.txt`, ...)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI got confused by the behavior of `Get-ChildItem :` (and other provider cmdlets),  but that is really a separate issue:\r\n\r\nA filesystem-path-argument-initial `:` is interpreted as a _relative path_, but on Windows (unlike on Unix), file/directory _names_ mustn't contain `:`, so there is no point in trying to interpret as such.\r\n\r\nDoing so is probably not a big deal in practice,  (`cmd.exe` similarly yields a `File Not Found`), but the current error message, which claims _nonexistence_ (`Cannot find path '...' because it does not exist`) with the _full path_ based on the current location is a bit confusing.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
