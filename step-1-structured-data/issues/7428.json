  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nThe help text for the command -AllBindings in the help page of \"Disable-NetAdapterBinding\" specify that \"Some protocols and filters may be mandatory and therefore cannot be disabled\"; however when used the command disables all the protocols, even those that cannot be disabled with -ComponentID  like  ms_netbt, ms_pppoe, ms_rdma_ndk, ms_pppoe, or when using -DisplayName. I assume these protocols that cannot be disabled using the -ComponentID or -DisplayName are the mandatory protocols that shouldn't be disabled.\r\n\r\nSo I was wondering; is this behavior normal, or is it an issue? \r\n\r\n\r\nStep to reproduce: \r\n\r\nDisable-NetAdapterBinding -Name 'Ethernet' -AllBindings -IncludeHidden\r\n\r\nThe command disables everything and it is impossible to re-enable disabled protocols like   ms_netbt, ms_pppoe, ms_rdma_ndk or ms_pppoe\r\n\r\n![capture2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25066224/43535577-abfd7664-95ba-11e8-9cdf-ec6435298c29.JPG)\r\n![capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25066224/43535579-b11010c6-95ba-11e8-87ad-258b200c3f68.JPG)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
