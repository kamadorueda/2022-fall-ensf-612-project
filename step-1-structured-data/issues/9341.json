  "body": "Currently the 'Type' column of the formatted output for a runspace object is 'local' unless the runspace is a WSMan remote runspace.  Consequently a SSH session runspace is labled as 'local', which is incorrect.\r\n\r\nIt might make sense to mark other remote runspaces that can only connect to local machine (out-of-proc, named pipe, hyper-v socket) to be marked 'local'.  But since SSH can go off-box like WSMan, it should be marked 'remote' instead of 'local'.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would like to see all remote runspaces marked 'remote' even if the underlying transport can only connect to the local machine, because they all use the remoting system.  The 'ComputerName' column will clarify where the connection is to (localhost or remote computer name).\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create an SSH session\r\n$sshSession = New-PSSession -HostName <computerName>\r\n\r\n# Output runspace object\r\n$sshSession.Runspace\r\n\r\n Id Name             ComputerName    Type         State      Availability\r\n -- ----             ------------    ----         -----      ------------\r\n11  Runspace11       localhost       Local        Opened     Busy\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n```none\r\n'Type' column should be 'Remote'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n'Type' column is 'Local'\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.17763\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
