Create a powershell script. \n   \n   ``` powershell\n   Write-Output \"Hello from OSX\"\n   ```\n2. Attempt to run with `-File` or `-Command`, quoting the path.\n## Expected behavior\n\nUsing quoted file paths should work.\n## Actual behavior\n\n``` sh\nrob@skylight $ /usr/local/bin/powershell -NoProfile -NonInteractive -NoLogo -File \"~/code/temp/hello.ps1\"\nThe argument '~/code/temp/hello.ps1' to the -File parameter does not exist. Provide the path to an existing '.ps1' file as an argument to the -File parameter.\nPowerShell\nCopyright (C) 2016 Microsoft Corporation.
