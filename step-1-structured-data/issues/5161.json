  "body": " fix issue #3325\r\n\r\nAfter we merge #4196, the fix will break some our partner's working code. Although the working code often works with an invalid assembly path.\r\n\r\nThis fix is to follow the old logic to minimize the breaking change.\r\n\r\n1. we first try to load the assembly from the file path\r\n2. if it fails, we try to load the assembly from the assembly name\r\n3. if 2 passes, we ignore the exception and return the assembly. otherwise we throw the exception.",
