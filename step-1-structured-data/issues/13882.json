There is no equivalent feature for the error types and values returned. If an attribute like this existed, error types could be discovered programatically. Platyps could output the error information to the cmdlet documentation.\r\n\r\nIt would be worthwhile to enumerate all the specific ErrorRecords that a cmdlet returns. We should also add some language that other exceptions may be raised by underlying providers or API interfaces.\r\n\r\nThe error documentation has been requested by end users. See https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/issues/6797.\r\n",
