Works on v0.4.0 and not on the development version. \n\nPowershell debugging broke in one of the following commits: \n~~5bdb215034ed2e51d3f95ab85cdcaf5b5504ac70 - \"Don't compile GetComputerInfoCommand.cs\"~~\nd9bf6b037f7c859b0951d0f0a3f7dc52fae58cb5 - \"Update files from Source Depot changeset\": \nOccured here during source depot merge at line 1412 when the !CORECLR guard was removed in MshSnapinInfo.cs. We are currently blocked on adding Microsoft.PowerShell.Diagnostics as listed in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/1042. I will be adding the guard back in along with tests.\n~~aa5007cd7a9be619cb931a6f35198c8c8dabfd93 -Bumped windows-build~~\n\nTests were passing because we only cover instances of setting breakpoints, not continuing into debugging. Adding those tests now.\n",
