  "body": "Note: While I haven't looked at what's going on under the hood, the fact that other shells (`cmd.exe`, WSL `bash`, `bash` on Unix, Git `bash`) do _not_ exhibit this problem leads me to suspect that PowerShell is the culprit.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n* Open Visual Studio Code (tested with v1.17.2)\r\n* Make PowerShell the default shell by adding the following to the user preferences:\r\n\r\n   * Windows: `\"terminal.integrated.shell.windows\": \"pwsh\"`\r\n   * macOS: `\"terminal.integrated.shell.osx\": \"pwsh\",  \"terminal.integrated.shellArgs.osx\": []`\r\n   * Linux: `\"terminal.integrated.shell.linux\": \"pwsh\"`\r\n\r\n*  Open a folder that has subfolders.\r\n\r\n* In the Explorer view in the side bar, right-click on a subfolder and choose `Open in Terminal`.\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell instance  that is created in the integrated terminal should have the right-clicked subfolder as the current location.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe PowerShell instance  that is created in the integrated terminal _invariably_ has the folder that was originally opened in Visual Studio Code as the current location.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.9 on macOS 10.13\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.9 on Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-beta.9 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\nWindows PowerShell v5.1.15063.674 on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.15063)\r\n```\r\n",
