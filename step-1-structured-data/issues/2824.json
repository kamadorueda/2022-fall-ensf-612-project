  "body": "In PowerShell V4 we added this behavior so that the disconnected session could be reconnected using Enter-PSSession which then allows debugging the remote session interactively.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this is that it interrupts the Invoke-Command execution causing it to return immediately and before the invoked scriptblock is completed running.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is no longer needed in V5 because there are now new advanced debugging features which can be used to attach to the remote session and interactively debug it.\r\n\r\nI feel that we can simply remove this behavior as I doubt it is being used.",
