  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n1. Create a CNAME DNS entry that points to an authorized DHCP server.\r\n2. Run Get-DhcpServerInDC.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nExpected behavior is for Get-DhcpServerInDC to return only authorized DHCP server listed in the \"CN=NetServices,CN=Services,CN=Configuration,DC=DOMAIN\" configuration of Active Directory.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nGet-DhcpServerInDC is returning objects that include a DNS alias for one of the authorized DHCP servers.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nThis causes errors when the objects are piped as the DNS Alias typically is not an Active Directory Computer Object and therefor generates errors in the pipeline.\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.7\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.7\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\nThis is the results of Get-DhcpServerInDC (with a select to limit results to the server entries in question)\r\n![Returns](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100967931/197600002-cf70e417-f928-4d71-a4a4-0d60a5ca0756.png)\r\nNote that the top entry is the Alias from DNS. The bottom entry is the actual server.\r\n\r\nThis is shows that only the actual server is listed in Active Directory\r\n![ADSI Edit Results](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100967931/197602043-abdfaf60-93ef-4913-8674-949cda83579b.png)\r\n\r\nThis shows partial results of \"netsh dhcp show server\". Only the entry in question is returned in the results - not the alias.\r\n![Results of netsch](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100967931/197601155-c1ab1637-9b59-4a1e-bbf3-0e4c5a649a2a.png)\r\n\r\nAttempting to use \"Remove-DhcpServerInDC\" for the erroneous entry results in this error.\r\n![Remove Error](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/100967931/197601770-aadcda67-3856-4908-bc55-ac066a683bc0.png)\r\n",
