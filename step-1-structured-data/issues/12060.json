  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n`curl` has the parameter `--unix-socket` which is super useful when dealing with those services which use them (like Docker). for example:\r\n \r\n`curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://v1.40/images/json| convertfrom-json`\r\n\r\nIt seems that our webrequest and restmethods should support this.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nOne possible approach would be to allow the uri property to encode the path to the socket\r\nIt seems like the cmdlets have enough parameter sets, but adding parameter sets for this might also be reasonable.",
