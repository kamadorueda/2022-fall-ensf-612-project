  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWhen using `-PipelineVariable` upstream in a command to create and populate a variable, the value of that variable does not appear to be available when referencing it in `ForEach-Object -Parallel`\r\n\r\nInstead, nothing seems to happen. The variable appears to be null.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, I tested it with both `$using:foo` and `$foo`, though I would assume `$using:foo` is the correct usage here.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> 1..5 |\r\n  ForEach-Object { $_ } -PipelineVariable foo |\r\n  ForEach-Object -Parallel { $using:foo } -ThrottleLimit 2\r\n1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\nPS>\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> 1..5 |\r\n  ForEach-Object { $_ } -PipelineVariable foo |\r\n  ForEach-Object -Parallel { $using:foo } -ThrottleLimit 2\r\nPS>\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nN/A\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
