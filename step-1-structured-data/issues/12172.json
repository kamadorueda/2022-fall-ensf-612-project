Even if I explicitly import the WMI cmdlets via the compatibility layer (`Import-Module Microsoft.PowerShell.Management -UseWindowsPowerShell`, which is probably not a good idea, given PS Core has its own version of that module), I can't _invoke_ it.\r\n\r\n  * For context, please explain why you need to use a cmdlet that was superseded by `Get-CimInstance` in Windows PowerShell 3.0 (2012). (Of course, if it _can_ be invoked, it shouldn't cause subsequent commands to malfunction; but perhaps the answer is to simply _disallow_ use of `Get-WmiObject`).\r\n\r\n  * Does it also happen with `Get-CimInstance win32_Bios` (I don't see a problem)?\r\n\r\n* _How_ do set-location/cd/pushd not work as expected?\r\n",

      "body": "@mklement0 we've seen this before. Essentially it seems like if you call `Get-WmiObject` in PS7, currently it uses the Windows PowerShell compatibility remoting session to load the relevant Windows PowerShell module.\r\n\r\nIt also (erroneously) clobbers the already imported or otherwise available cmdlets from the PS7 module like Get-Location / Get-ChildItem / etc which are shadowed by the auto-generated functions that operate with the compatibility remoting.\r\n\r\nAs a result, we get some rather broken behaviour. I think @PaulHigin was notified and may be working on a fix.\r\n\r\nFunctionally speaking, this is a duplicate of #12014 \ud83d\ude42 ",
