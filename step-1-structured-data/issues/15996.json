  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [x] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nUsing a simple function to call an advanced function with `-ErrorAction Stop` does not properly execute a `catch` block within the advanced function if Write-Error is invoked within a try block, even though it will if you call that same function from the command line or within an advanced function.\r\n\r\nRepro:\r\n```\r\nfunction foo {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    process {\r\n        try { Write-Error 'Foo error' }\r\n        # Calling Write-Output from catch will stop the catch block when foo is called with -ea stop; must use Write-Host\r\n        catch { Write-Host 'Foo catch' }\r\n        finally { Write-Host 'Foo finally' }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nfunction bar { foo -ea stop }\r\nfunction baz {\r\n    [cmdletbinding()]\r\n    param()\r\n    process{\r\n        foo -ea stop\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> foo -ea stop\r\nFoo catch\r\nFoo finally\r\nPS> bar\r\nFoo catch\r\nFoo finally\r\nPS> baz\r\nFoo catch\r\nFoo finally\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> foo -ea stop\r\nFoo catch\r\nFoo finally\r\nPS> bar\r\nFoo finally\r\nPS> baz\r\nFoo catch\r\nFoo finally\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n# Also tested in 7.2.0-preview.9 and 5.1.0\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
