      "body": "Re backward-compatibility: there might be PowerShell code that lazily initializes an IntPtr, and has a variable whose value is one of:\r\n\r\n- $Null if the IntPtr has not been needed yet, and initialization has not been attempted\r\n- [IntPtr]::Zero if the initialization failed and should not be attempted again\r\n- nonzero IntPtr if the initialization succeeded\r\n\r\nIf code like that uses a conversion to bool (rather than a comparison to $Null), and PowerShell starts treating [IntPtr]::Zero as false, then it can cause the code to retry the initialization more times than the developer intended, and perhaps hurt performance. I imagine code like that would be rare in PowerShell but anyway the risk exists.\r\n\r\nThere is a plan to make C# treat IntPtr as an integer type (<https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/6065>). If that is implemented and libraries start returning numbers (rather than only handles and pointers) as IntPtr, then it becomes more important to treat IntPtr consistently with other integer types in PowerShell too. That would preferably include making `([IntPtr]1 + [IntPtr]1)` evaluate to to [IntPtr]2 rather than [Int32]2. IntPtr arithmetic in PowerShell doesn't have to be done at the same time as this [bool][IntPtr]::Zero change, though.",

      "body": "Good point, @KalleOlaviNiemitalo, but to me your scenario perfectly exemplifies a [bucket 3](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/dev-process/breaking-change-contract.md#bucket-3-unlikely-grey-area) change: a breaking change worth making for its benefits, given that it is unlikely that existing code is impacted.\r\n\r\n@rkeithhill, the upcoming .NET 7+ change that @KalleOlaviNiemitalo points makes it even more compelling to fix the behavior of `[IntPtr]` and `[UIntPtr]`, more fundamentally - see #17677\r\n\r\nOn a philosophical note re the proposed change not being compelling:\r\n\r\nPowerShell has amassed a [sizable collection of warts](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/6745), some of which cannot be fixed if backward compatibility must be maintained.\r\n\r\nLeaving warts that _can_ be removed in place ensures that the pain of stumbling upon them is carried forward, tripping up not only newcomers, but even seasoned users who may have stumbled upon them before, but have forgotten about them.\r\n\r\nA (reasonable) _workaround_ being available is _not_ sufficient to ease this pain.\r\n\r\n(And that a fix wasn't requested doesn't mean that people haven't run into the problem or don't want a fix. Especially pre-open-source, PowerShell users were successfully trained to resign themselves to what they were given and to live with workarounds.)\r\n\r\nFor that reason, (not-too-breaking) wart removals are compelling _in general_, except perhaps if the implementation effort is too great, which I don't think is the case here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
