  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n- install OpenSSH client for windows - either the windows release through add/remove features, or latest binary from [repo](https://github.com/PowerShell/Win32-OpenSSH/releases/tag/V8.6.0.0p1-Beta)\r\n- open powershell core (v7+) directly and ssh to a linux server with `ssh 192.168.50.55`\r\n- The provided MOTD from the server is either printed once (as intended) or repeated twice. \r\n- This does not happen on every connection but will reliably happen every few connections.\r\n- This does not happen from windows CMD, powershell (native windows installed version), PuTTY or any linux client. \r\n- Occurs on multiple servers with different distros, OpenSSH server versions and configurations.\r\n- This does not happen from powershell core when opened from within windows terminal - only from the native executable. \r\n- This happens on the included openssh version 8.1 and the latest binary release 8.6 (which included a fix from the ssh side for this in Powershell/Win32-OpenSSH#1736 )\r\n- This does not happen when the Powershell core window is maximised - it only happens when in a non maximised window\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nSSH MOTD is printed once and only once on connection.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nSSH MOTD is printed once or twice on connection to a linux server when opened from powershell core. \r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\nOpenSSH_for_Windows_8.1p1, LibreSSL 3.0.2 \r\nOpenSSH_for_Windows_8.6p1, LibreSSL 3.3.3 (8.6.0.0)\r\nConnecting to - Debian Buster, Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 18.04, raspbian buster\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT - \r\nadded further details about commands used. \r\n",
