Thus, adding `which` to act as the alias of `where.exe` is a better choice.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nReferences:\r\n\r\n- <https://stackoverflow.com/a/65148/9920172>\r\n- <https://superuser.com/a/1397265>\r\n",
