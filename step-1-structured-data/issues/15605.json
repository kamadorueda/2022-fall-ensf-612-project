  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThis is more of a question than anything else. I've been looking at using the GuestConfiguration module demonstrated in a [recent DSC Community call](https://dsccommunity.org/community_calls/2021-06-02-notes/). I've had a couple of issues with it, but this could be just me doing something wrong. Either way, I'm not sure where I can discuss these issues as the Project Site URL on the [module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/GuestConfiguration/3.3.0-preview0003) goes to https://github.com/PowerShell/GuestConfiguration which gives me a 404. \r\n\r\nIt's possible that the GuestConfiguration repo has moved or is marked as private.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nCorrect the URL in the module or make the repo accessible.",
