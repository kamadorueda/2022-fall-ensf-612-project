  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nAs part of PowerShell runtime configuration I may want to set certain things in the `powershell.config.json` file\r\nOn new upgrades of PowerShell, my settings in this file should not be lost and should be combined with any additional new settings that would be set as part of the install, so that I don't need to set these on each upgrade.\r\n\r\nThis would help alleviate some concern in #15644 in management of this file\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
