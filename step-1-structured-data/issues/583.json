  "body": "Running `chsh -s /bin/bash`, requires a password, which it wouldn't let me enter.  Seems related to bug #484 .  could be a bug in the linux program chsh though.  Thoughts?\n\nRepro:\n1. in a running powershell session, execute `chsh -s /bin/bash` asks for a password. \n\nExpected:\nenter password, no output, default shell is now bash.\n\nActual:\nWhen typing password, it enters a newline upon typing first character, then errors, stating that the program \"password\" could not be found.\n\nWorkaround:\nI edited the /etc/passwd file directly under sudo.  it may be possible to switch to bash using the `echo tty` workaround in #484 as well, but I think this definitely needs to be addressed as users will eventually be expected to adopt powershell as the default native host, as well as be able to move back and forth from different native shells easily.\n",
