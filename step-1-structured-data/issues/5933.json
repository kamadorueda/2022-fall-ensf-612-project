      "body": "The processes themselves do not consume a lot of resources. Resources consumes what works within them. In some cases, we really consume a lot of resources when we work with file system or output formatting. Partly it depends on the .Net Core 2.0.0 we use - they are already working on optimization and with release version 2.1.0 we will automatically work faster and better use resources. After that I hope we will also optimize inside PowerShell Core.\r\nAlso you use cmdlets from additional modules - they themselves can be implemented so that consume a lot of resources and should be optimized too.",
