  "body": "(Let me know if we should separate this into two issues)\r\n\r\nRight now, TabExpansion2 can only return all the results for a given query and the only way to cancel it is to stop it by calling PowerShell.Stop or Ctrl+C\r\n\r\nThere should be a more robust way of getting completions.\r\n\r\nSome ways I've thought about it:\r\n* Support some better way to cancel and return a partial result (in C# I'd love to use a CancellationToken)\r\n* Support a way to ask for the first X completions for the perf gains\r\n\r\nThis would make intellisense in VSCode so much snappier because partial results are something that is unachievable right now.",
