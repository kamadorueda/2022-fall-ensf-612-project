So I'm leaning towards adding a `-NoTranscriptHeader` switch parameter to `Start-Transcript`, rather than `-NoHeaderMast`. \r\n\r\nI haven't looked into your *set prompt* idea yet, but I'll see what I can find.

Override that function to change the prompt, e.g. in your PS profile. You could handle all manner of scenarios by basing `prompt`'s logic on environment variables.\r\n\r\nGiven that, I think `Start-Transcript` would be overstepping its boundaries by changing the prompt.
