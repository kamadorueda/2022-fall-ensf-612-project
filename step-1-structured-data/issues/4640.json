  "body": "The `Verifies Invoke-WebRequest Supports Multiple response headers with same name` test from #4494 is failing on Linux and macOS due to an implementation difference of `HttpListener` on Linux and macOS where multiple response headers are concatenated instead of sent as separate headers.\r\n\r\nIn Windows:\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 2\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nServer: Microsoft-HTTPAPI/2.0\r\nX-Fake-Header: testvalue01\r\nX-Fake-Header: testvalue02\r\nDate: Tue, 22 Aug 2017 09:49:37 GMT\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn Linux/macOS:\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nX-Fake-Header: testvalue01, testvalue02\r\nServer: Microsoft-NetCore/2.0\r\nDate: Tue, 22 Aug 2017 09:18:18 GMT\r\nContent-Type: text/plain\r\nContent-Length: 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not a failure of the test but an issue with the current method used for serving test content with `HttpListener`.\r\n\r\nIssue  #4639 has been created to track creating a cross-platform multiple header response solution for this test. In the mean time, mark this test as pending to prevent nightly failures.",
