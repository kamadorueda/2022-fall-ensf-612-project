  "body": "fix https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3267\r\n\r\nThis change removes the call to ContentHelper.GetEncoding since it's logic for returning a default encoding when a ContentType header is not found disables subsequent checks for meta charset definitions.\r\n\r\nAll variations of the Invoke-WebRequest tests have been mirrored for Invoke-RestMethod.  Verbose output is used to verify the encoding since Invoke-RestMethod returns the json content directly instead of a response object. (See ExecuteRestMethod)\r\n",
