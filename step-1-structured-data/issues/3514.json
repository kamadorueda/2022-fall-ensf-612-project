Personally, I prefer the \"in terminal\" experience of credential prompting, but I get that it may not be as secure as the Windows built-it GUI mechanism.  Perhaps a switch parameter could be offered on Windows to display the credential GUI?",

      "body": "The credential GUI doesn't work over an SSH connection and the current in console prompt is preferred.  We would prefer that any solution work cross-platform and reflect credential prompts for that platform. `Get-Credential` is working as designed and the Cmdlet Working Group sees no reason to make any changes. The community is welcome to create a graphical interface for PowerShell 7 related to specific platforms, i.e. `Get-WindowsCredential` or `Get-LinuxCredential`, and publish it to the PowerShell Gallery.",
