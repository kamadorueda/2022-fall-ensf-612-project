  "body": "Standard Deviation is a measure that is used to quantify the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of data values. A low standard deviation indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values.\n\nThis is a commonly used to get an insight about a set of values, and would be easy to implement as an addition to Measure-Object.\n",

      "body": "This requires a double iterate: first, to calculate the mean value, the second, to calculate the variance.\nNow Measure-Object don't collect values for second iterate. It is too complicate the cmdlet.\nAlso there's the challenge of the accuracy of the calculations for real data.\nI believe this is a task for specialized statistical module.\n",
