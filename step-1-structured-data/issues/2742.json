  "body": "I;m trying to update the [Jenkins PowerShell plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/PowerShell+Plugin) to handle Linux as well as Windows. At the moment, it passes `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass` as a command line parameter. While testing, I noticed that this causes PowerShell 6.0 on Linux to throw an \"Aborted\" error and exit with error code 134:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndaniel@debian-test:/tmp$ echo \"Write-Output 'Hello World'\" > test.ps1\r\ndaniel@debian-test:/tmp$ powershell ./test.ps1\r\nHello World\r\ndaniel@debian-test:/tmp$ powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass ./test.ps1\r\nAborted\r\ndaniel@debian-test:/tmp$ echo $?\r\n134\r\n```\r\n\r\nI know that script signing currently isn't implemented for non-Windows platforms, but perhaps it could just ignore the option?\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.12\r\nCLRVersion\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
