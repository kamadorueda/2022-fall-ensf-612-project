Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in [Affected Software](#affected-software) to see if your version of PowerShell Core is affected.\r\n1. If you are running a version of PowerShell Core where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected.  This only existed for preview version of `6.0`.\r\n\r\n### How do I update to an unaffected version?\r\n\r\nFollow the instructions at [Installing PowerShell Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/setup/installing-powershell?view=powershell-6) to install the latest version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n### Commit IDs\r\n\r\n[f8f3774d](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/f8f3774dfca94557ff05446c87192ea1edbb356d)\r\n\r\n### Reporting Security Issues\r\n\r\nIf you have found a potential security issue in PowerShell Core,\r\nplease email details to secure@microsoft.com.\r\n\r\n### Support\r\n\r\nYou can ask questions about this issue on GitHub in the PowerShell organization.\r\nThis is located at https://github.com/PowerShell/.\r\nThe Announcements repo (https://github.com/PowerShell/Announcements)\r\nwill contain this bulletin as an issue and will include a link to a discussion issue where you can ask questions.\r\n\r\n### What if the update breaks my script or module?\r\n\r\nYou can uninstall the newer version of PowerShell Core and install the previous version of PowerShell Core.\r\nThis should be treated as a temporary measure.\r\nTherefore, the script or module should be updated to work with the patched version of PowerShell Core.\r\n\r\n### Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n[Amirreza Niakanlahiji](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aniakanl/) [(@DissectMalware)](https://twitter.com/DissectMalware) of [University of North Carolina at Charlotte](https://www.uncc.edu/)\r\n\r\nMicrosoft recognizes the efforts of those in the security community who help us protect customers through coordinated vulnerability disclosure.\r\n\r\nSee [acknowledgments](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/acknowledgments) for more information.\r\n\r\n### External Links\r\n\r\n[CVE-2018-8415](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2018-8415)\r\n\r\n### Revisions\r\n\r\nV1.0 (November 13, 2018): Advisory published.\r\nv1.1 (November 13, 2018): Updated Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n*Version 1.1*\r\n*Last Updated 2018-11-13*\r\n",
