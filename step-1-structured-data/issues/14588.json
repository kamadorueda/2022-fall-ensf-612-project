What if you wanted it to be closer to the color of black?\r\nOr what if you wanted a light red? Or just plain pink?\r\nI would like this to be an easy to implement feature for powershell. \r\nThank you.\r\n",

It's not easy to implement for PowerShell because of backwards compatibility and terminal / Windows API / .Net / cross-platform compatibility.\r\n\r\nANSI escape codes are supported in [Windows 10 build 18298 console](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/new-experimental-console-features/) and [Windows Terminal](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/introducing-windows-terminal/) and there are some examples [here](https://duffney.io/usingansiescapesequencespowershell/#8-bit-256-color-foreground-background) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56679782/how-to-use-ansi-escape-sequence-color-codes-for-psreadlineoption-v2-in-powershel) about using them for more colours and 24-bit colours.\r\n\r\ne.g.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> $e = [char]0x1b\r\n>> \"$e[38;2;255;128;128;48;2;128;0;255;4mtest$e[0m\"\r\ntest    # in pink and purple and underlined\r\n```",
