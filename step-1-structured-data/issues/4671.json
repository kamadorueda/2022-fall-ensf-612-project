  "body": "On both Windows and Unix platforms, `Start-Process -UseNewEnvironment` results in an environment that is missing crucial standard environment variables, making the new environment virtually useless, while not providing a mechanism to define a new environment:\r\n\r\n* On Windows, `-UseNewEnvironment` defines _only_ the variables that are _explicitly_ defined, as displayed in System Properties (`sysdm.cpl`), with crucial, usually automatically defined variables such as `$env:ProgramFiles` missing, and `$env:USERNAME` unexpectedly containing `SYSTEM`.\r\n\r\n     * This even prevents another `powershell` instance from being started this way - see https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/3545#issuecomment-320699488 and below.\r\n\r\n* On Unix, an _empty_ environment is essentially passed (with _no_ environment variables defined at all, except `$env:PSModulePath`).\r\n\r\n    * This even prevents invoking any executable by filename only, given that `$env:PATH` is undefined - see below.\r\n\r\n    * While this behavior is similar to POSIX [`env -i`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/env.html) on Unix platforms, the `env` utility notably includes a mechanism to provide a _new_ environment via `name=value` pairs, which `Start-Process` lacks.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPossible solutions:\r\n\r\n* Repurpose `-UseNewEnvironment` to not start with a blank slate / crucial variables missing, but to provide the same environment that a shell would see when directly launched by the system (in other words: any environment-variable modifications made by the calling shell would be ignored).\r\n\r\n* Additionally, provide a way to pass a custom environment, applied _on top_ of the current or pristine (`-UseNewEnvironment`) environment:\r\n\r\n   * E.g., a new `-Environment <hashtable>`  / `-Environment <Collections.DictionaryEntry[]>` parameter could be used.\r\n\r\n    * If someone truly wanted an _empty_ environment, they could start with `$emptyEnv = (Get-ChildItem env:); $emptyEnv | % { $_.Value = $null }` and pass `-Environment $emptyEnv`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe `-Environment` feature would allow for an - incomplete - approximation of the convenient ad-hoc, command-scoped environment-variable definition feature that POSIX-like shells such as `bash` offer, where you can prepend one or more `name=value` pairs to a command:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Bash (any POSIX-compatible shell)\r\n# Defines $env:FOO as 'bar', but *only for the some-utility child process*.\r\nFOO=bar some-utility 666\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Update_: #3316 suggests emulating this syntax in PowerShell, which would be the best solution.\r\n\r\nThe PS approximation would be:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process -Wait  -Environment @{ FOO = 'bar' } some-utility -Args 666\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, a crucial limitation is that use of `Start-Process` makes the external utility operate outside PowerShell's streams, so the only way to provide input / collect output is via the `-Redirect*` parameters, which requires _auxiliary files_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent behavior\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process -UseNewEnvironment -Wait -NoNewWindow pwsh -args '-Command', 'gci env:; whoami'\r\n```\r\n\r\n* On Windows: PowerShell refuses to start - see #3545; note that adding `-LoadUserProfile` makes no difference.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nInternal Windows PowerShell error.

Hence Path is incomplete.  It seems the fix here is to merge Path (append user PATH to end of machine PATH).  USERNAME should be special cased to the user.  The test is to start a new cmd.exe from Windows shell, run `set` and have the env vars match if using `-UseNewEnvironment`.",
