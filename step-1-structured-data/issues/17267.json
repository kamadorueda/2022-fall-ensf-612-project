Get-Module lists available modules\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nOn loading PowerShell reports untrusted signatures for Psreadline.format.xml and PSReadline.psm1 (but not .PSD1)\r\n\r\nGet-Module reports untrusted signatures for every signed CDXML file (but not their associated PSD1), but reports no errors where files are unsigned. \r\n\r\nLoading VSCode the PowerShell Integrated console reports untrusted signatures for the PS1, types.ps1.xml and .PSM1 files for PowerShell editor services (but not their PSD1 nor files in PSReadline).\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nNo error\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\n\u001b[32;1mName                           Value\u001b[0m\r\n\u001b[32;1m----                           -----\u001b[0m\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u0393\u00c7\u00aa}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "Not sure if this a bug, or just strange behaviour. But I've applied 7.2.3 and the update extension for VSCode in the last couple of days and also been in discussions about policy and signing. \r\n\r\nIt appears that when starting the shell (_outside_ VSCode) , the .PSD1 for PSReadline is trusted _enough_ to try to load the format and PSM1 files, which are signed with the same cert but loading them wants some assurance the cert can be trusted. \r\n\r\nThe same applies to all the CIM cmdlets inherited from PS5 the PSD1 and CDXML files are signed with the same cert but  the CDXML files aren't trusted  for example if I run `Get-Printer`  (V5 CIM cmdlet) in V7.2.3 I get prompted to approve the CDXML files to load the module. But the autoloading mechanism has read the printmanagement module's PSD1 file which is signed with the same cert, and figured out that is the module which delivers Get-Printer, and the CDXML files to be loaded and never asked me to approve the module as a whole, just those component files. \r\n\r\nIt looks like some certs are trusted for some file types and not others. The behaviour is unexpected, but may be by design. If anyone can shed any light... \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

See the code at https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/runtime/CompiledScriptBlock.cs#L206\r\n\r\nVSCode cannot present you the same prompt and thus throws the error instead. I think that's determined by how PSReadLine gets loaded by VSCode. @andschwa may be able to share more details on that part.",
