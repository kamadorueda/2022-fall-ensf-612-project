  "body": "I'm using **Autohotkey** to suppress the annoying menukey functionality of the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key (selecting menu items on a single press of <kbd>Alt</kbd>). However, in PowerShell it prints `@` symbols instead of printing nothing\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAssign the following Autohotkey (this is for v2, in v1 omit the `'` symbols) mapping to the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key:\r\n```\r\n~Alt::Send '{Blind}{vkE8}'\r\n```\r\nThis sends an unassigned key signal that should do nothing, but has the benefit of masking the menukey functionality (`vkFF` has no mapping, but still bugs Powershell).\r\n\r\nPress the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nNothing should be printed, just like nothing is printed in all the other apps (cmd.exe console, old system powershell.exe console or any other GUI app)\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nI get an `@` symbol printed instead\r\n```none\r\n@\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\nTried in both 7.1 and 7.2beta\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0-preview.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0-preview.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
