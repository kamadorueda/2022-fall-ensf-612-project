Maybe do some re-try logic for both places?\n\nAlso, excellent point about choco.\nI think we should add following logic in `Start-PSBootstrap`\n1. If choco is installed and we detected missed components bring them thru choco.\n2. If not, error out with instruction about manual install\n",

      "body": "@vors @mirichmo I've updated the Start-PSBootstrap to automate installation of choco, cmake and Win 10 SDK. \n\n@vors Regarding what mc.exe location we should use, I believe Win10 SDK always installs it under \"Windows Kits\". The older versions of SDK used to install it under \"Microsoft SDKs\", however the compiler got updated since then so we should rely on the latest bits. As I mentioned, I added Win10 SDK installation to the bootstrapping function, so we should always have it available where we expect it now.\n",
