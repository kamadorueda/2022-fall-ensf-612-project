      "body": "Hi @chenyj796, as the error message you're seeing states, `&&` is not currently implemented in PowerShell. For now, you will have to write something like\r\n```\r\nswapoff -a; if ($?) { sed -i '/swap/d' /etc/fstab }\r\n```\r\n> It means in the scope \"&{}\", native commands will have higher execution priority\r\n\r\nI'm not sure I understand exactly what you're asking. `& { }` simply creates a new variable scope.  Why do you think it will change execution priority?",
