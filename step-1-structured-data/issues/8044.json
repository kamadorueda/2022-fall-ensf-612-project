  "body": "Hi\r\nMay I know how I can add logs to begin and end of a function in Powershell automately? Something like the AspectJ for Java.  I have the question as I'm going to have the clear call stack trace like all functions call with log \"<Script>:<Function>:Begin\" and \"<Script>:<Function>:End\" at the beginning and end.\r\n\r\nThanks",
