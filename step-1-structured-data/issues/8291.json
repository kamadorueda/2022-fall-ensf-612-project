      "body": "Interesting. I hadn't considered that. \r\n\r\nFirst thoughts on the effects of removing the parameter on non-Windows platforms.  \r\n\r\nThat would entirely prevent `-Persist` confusion while using the shell or writing a script on a non-Windows machine :thumbsup:\r\n\r\nHowever, suppose someone writes a script calling `New-PSDrive -Persist ...` on Windows. Then they attempt to run the script on MacOS. Is it better for debugging to throw a `ParameterBindingException` or a `PlatformNotSupportedException`?\r\n\r\nI think the `PlatformNotSupportedException` is self-explanatory. OTOH, maybe the `ParameterBindingException` would warrant an explanation in the cmdlet help. If so, do you keep the `Persist` parameter help to explain that on non-Windows machines, even though the parameter isn't available? Perhaps the scenario is contrived, but worth a thought at least.\r\n\r\nIn terms of implementation, I think removing the parameter would require wrapping the `Persist` property in a `#if !UNIX` directive. Therefore, every reference to that property would also need to be wrapped in a `#if !UNIX` directive. For many references, I would prefer not do that. Though In this case, there is only one reference to `Persist` and this cmdlet seems quite stable. \r\n\r\nWhat do you think? ",
