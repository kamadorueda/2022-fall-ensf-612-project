  "body": "This resolves issue #5391, which is tagged with `6.0.0-GA`, therefore this should help with getting pwsh out of the door in January.\r\n\r\nIt removes `PerformWSManPluginReportCompletion` as stated in the issue and its associated class member `g_pPluginContext `, which is now unused as well.\r\n\r\nThe best reviewer is probably @mirichmo , who raised the initial issue with very helpful descriptions or @dantraMSFT who is currently assigned to the issue.",
