      "body": "Hi @burkasaurusrex, as near as i can tell, you're getting the error because a) you have `set-strictmode -version latest` turned on and b) you're passing 4 objects into the pipeline but only have 3 objects in the `$info` array. This means that the last object in the pipeline will cause an out-of-bounds error. Now if strictmode was off, then the last note added would be bound to null rather than producing an error. Does this sound right or am I missing something?",

This feels like a bug where the pipeline object isn't getting picked up by `Add-Member`, so you have to explicitly set `-InputObject` to access `$_`",

      "body": "Not a bug. When you pipe something directly into a cmdlet, you don't have access to the `$_` variable. It doesn't exist in the bare pipeline context. It exists in ForEach-Object, and it _can_ exist for parameters defined as being pipeline-bindable either by value or by property name.\r\n\r\n**If** that were the case with `-NotePropertyMembers` (it isn't, I just checked the help page, that parameter doesn't work with pipeline input) you could do what you're trying to do by adding a script block around the value expression here:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n0..2 | Add-Member -NotePropertyMembers { @{'Info' = $Info[$_]} } -PassThru | Select Info\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this parameter was not defined in this way, and likely also wasn't coded in the necessary fashion under the hood to enable this.\r\n\r\nThis absolutely could be done, I think, I don't immediately see a reason to avoid doing this, but it'd be an enhancement request rather than a bug fix.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, the issue is akin to doing, for example `$a | Get-ChildItem -Filter $_`\r\n\r\nThat variable isn't bound in the bare pipeline, only in scriptblock binding to pipeline parameters and the scriptblocks provided by ForEach-Object and the like.",

Still seems strange to me that this works no problem:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Info = @(\r\n    'a',\r\n    'b',\r\n    'c'\r\n)\r\n\r\n0..2 | % { Add-Member -InputObject $_ -NotePropertyMembers @{'Info' = $Info[$_]} -PassThru } | Select Info\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you exclude `-InputObject $_` it errors out, but if you include it, it works. So even though `-NotePropertyMembers` doesn't have pipeline access, it can still access the `-InputObject` using `$_`? And if it can access the `-InputObject` using `$_`, isn't the normal behavior of `-InputObject` in other cmdlets to pick up the object from the pipeline?",

      "body": "This works because of the extra cmdlet you added. `%` isn't a language operation, it's an alias for the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet; this cmdlet is what's allocating value to `$_` within the scriptblock(s) you pass to it. \ud83d\ude42 \r\n\r\nYou are correct that `-InputObject` \"picks up\" pipeline input, but that doesn't automatically happen unless you're piping directly into that cmdlet. You're not piping into `Add-Member` there, you're piping into `ForEach-Object`, which then assigns the input object to `$_` so that `Add-Member` can utilise it.\r\n\r\nIt's a bit easier to demonstrate if we write it without aliases:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Info = @(\r\n    'a',\r\n    'b',\r\n    'c'\r\n)\r\n\r\n0..2 | ForEach-Object {\r\n    Add-Member -InputObject $_ -NotePropertyMembers @{ 'Info' = $Info[$_] } -PassThru\r\n} | Select-Object -Property Info\r\n```",

      "body": "Yea, that part makes sense to me. I appreciate the back-and-forth - it's helped clarify why `Add-Member`'s pipeline behavior feels inconsistent.\r\n\r\nI probably should have called out a different example. Your example above works no problem, but this does not (removing `-InputObject $_`):\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$Info = @(\r\n    'a',\r\n    'b',\r\n    'c'\r\n)\r\n\r\n0..2 | ForEach-Object {\r\n    Add-Member -NotePropertyMembers @{ 'Info' = $Info[$_] } -PassThru\r\n} | Select-Object -Property Info\r\n```\r\nInstead it prompts for an InputObject:\r\n```none\r\ncmdlet Add-Member at command pipeline position 1\r\nSupply values for the following parameters:\r\nInputObject:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at the parameters in different help files, it looks like `Add-Member`'s `-InputObject` is mandatory while other more pipeline-friendly cmdlets (`Select-Object`, `Measure-Object`, etc.) are optional (though all of them mention that there is no default value...). I haven't dug into the code yet, but I'm guessing `-InputObject` for `Select-Object` and others defaults to the pipeline object?\r\n\r\nGiven that `Add-Member` is used to manipulate objects like these other cmdlets, it would make sense to me to have similar pipeline treatment. I'm hoping that makes more sense? Thanks again for the patience.",

      "body": "No problem! ^^\r\n\r\nThe scriptblock of a ForEach-Object command doesn't automatically pass the inputobject to all cmdlets executed within it. This would be a rather confusing if it did; imagine this case, for example:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n1..10 | ForEach-Object {\r\n    Get-ChildItem\r\n    Add-Member -NotePropertyMembers @{ 'Info' = $Info[$_] } -PassThru\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich command(s) should receive the complete pipeline input object? It's not clear what that would do if it behaved as you are expecting. This isn't Add-Member specific; all pipeline-capable cmdlets behave this way.\r\n\r\nYou can enter any number of commands in a ForEach-Object statement, it's just a regular old scriptblock like any other. Cmdlets within are not passed _any_ input from the pipeline without explicitly referencing the `$_` automatic variable (you'll also see it referred to as `$PSItem`; these are equivalent).\r\n\r\nWhere pipeline input is concerned, it's a pretty one-or-the-other; if you're _directly_ piping input into a cmdlet, you don't typically use `$_`. If you're putting the command(s) in a `ForEach-Object` cmdlet's scriptblock, you _must_ use `$_` to reference the input being passed in. This is because the ForEach-Object cmdlet itself is actually consuming the pipeline input and then assigning it to the `$_` variable inside its scriptblocks.",
