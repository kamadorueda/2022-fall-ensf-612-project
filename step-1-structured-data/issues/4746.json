Not actually sure if this is the best way to store the descriptions.\r\n\r\nTo keep the descriptions short I only took the first sentence from https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms714428(v=vs.85).aspx \"Action\" field. Aliases come from the same page\r\n\r\nNeed document [approved prefixes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/4746#discussion_r137717675) for some new verbs:\r\n- [x] Optimize - om\r\n- [x] Resize - rz\r\n- [x] Build - bd\r\n- [x] Deploy - dp\r\n- [x] Complete - cmp",

      "body": "@Tadas Thanks for your contribution!\r\n\r\n@lzybkr Could you please comment. Currently we use reflection and dynamically re-create `verbinfo` objects in `Get-Verb` cmdlet and also use reflection and build `s_validVerbs` and `s_recommendedAlternateVerbs` in Verbs.cs - perhaps the time has come to optimize performance of the code? Can we use someting like we use in `Types_Ps1Xml.cs`?",

      "body": "@Tadas @iSazonov - we don't need a cache for these new properties and reflection is fine - `Get-Verb` isn't important for performance.\r\n\r\n`s_recommendedAlternateVerbs` should probably be `Lazy` - it shouldn't be normal to need it.\r\n\r\n`s_validVerbs` could avoid reflection, but use reflection in debug builds to ensure that nothing was missed, but it never showed up in profiles during startup, so the difference might not be measurable.",
