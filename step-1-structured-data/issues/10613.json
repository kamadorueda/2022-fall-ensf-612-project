  "body": "Note: Even though `*` and `?` are reminiscent of wildcard patterns, `-as` does _not_ generally support them; the problem is limited to appending `*` or `?` to the _full_ type name.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# These work as expected.\r\n'System.Int32' -as [type] | should -be ([int])\r\n'System.Int3*' -as [type] | should -not -be ([int])  # incomplete name with *, not supported\r\n# These don't - they unexpectedly still return [int]\r\n'System.Int32*' -as [type] | should -not -be ([int]) # complete name with *\r\n'System.Int32?' -as [type] | should -not -be ([int]) # complete name with ?\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Update_: The problem is more general - see [@HumanEquivalentUnit's comment](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/10613#issuecomment-534761186) below.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nAll tests should pass.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe last two tests fail, because the trailing `*` / `?` following the full type name  is unexpectedly ignored:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected [int] to be different from the actual value, but got the same value.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.4\r\n```\r\n",
