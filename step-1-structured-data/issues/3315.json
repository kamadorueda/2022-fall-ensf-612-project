      "body": "As to the messages themselves:\r\n\r\n```\r\n/bin/bash: /tmp/.mount_kvGjoY/usr/lib/libtinfo.so.5: no version information available (required by /bin/bash)\r\n```\r\nThis is likely because the `AppRun` script exports `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to make PowerShell find the bundled libraries that it needs to run. While this works great for PowerShell itself, it may lead to the message above if the system's `bash` from the system is invoked (which it is by the `usr/bin/powershell.wrapper` script that asks the user to install a menu entry) while `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set. A cleaner solution may be to set [`rpath`](https://enchildfone.wordpress.com/2010/03/23/a-description-of-rpath-origin-ld_library_path-and-portable-linux-binaries/) inside the PowerShell executable to make it load the bundled libraries,  and not use a `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` at all. This would also have the advantage that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` would not leak into processes launched from within PowerShell.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$XDG_DATA_DIRS is missing. Please run /tmp/.mount_kvGjoY/usr/bin/powershell.wrapper from within an AppImage.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may be a bug in the `usr/bin/powershell.wrapper` bash script. But as mentioned above, I cannot reproduce this. That script could probably be stripped down, rewritten in PowerShell (wouldn't that be cool?) or removed altogether, if it proves to be problematic.",
