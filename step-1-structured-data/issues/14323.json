      "body": "@iSazonov I doubt the usefulness of this change. The most common scenario would be that the `POWERSHELL_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT` environment variable is not defined. The `GetEnvironmentVariableAsBool` method would just return from the `if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(str))` block, never hitting the `switch (str.ToLowerInvariant())` line.\r\n\r\nYour changes here has zero impact to the most common scenario. It improves a less common scenario with the cost of decreased readability, so I'm not convinced we want it. @JamesWTruher, can you please review and share your thoughts?",

It's a hindrance again. \r\nIdeally we could use bool.Parse() method but it only support \"true\"/\"false\" strings.",
