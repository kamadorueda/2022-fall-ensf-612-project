  "body": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nbased on [How to detect, enable and disable SMBv1, SMBv2, and SMBv3 in Windows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-server/storage/file-server/troubleshoot/detect-enable-and-disable-smbv1-v2-v3). Please see my testings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nSMBv1 detection:\r\n1. Start PS 7.1.3 as admin\r\n2. Run Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb1protocol  \r\n**Result: PS blocked**\r\n\r\nSMBv1 disabling:\r\n1. Start PS 7.1.3 as admin\r\n2. Run Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb1protocol \r\n**Result: PS blocked**\r\n\r\nSMBv2 detection:\r\n1. Start PS 7.1.3 as admin\r\n2. Run Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb2protocol  \r\n**Result:    EnableSMB2Protocol: true ** (fast and PS does not blocks)\r\n\r\nSMBv2 disabling:\r\n1. Start PS 7.1.3 as admin\r\n2. Run Disable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb2protocol \r\n**Result: PS blocked**\r\n\r\nSMBv3 detection:\r\n1. Start PS 7.1.3 as admin\r\n2. Run Get-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName smb3protocol  \r\n**Result:    EnableSMB2Protocol: blank message ** (fast without blocked)\r\n\r\n```\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n1. SMBv1 detection:  Some message describing if protocol is installed or not as fast as possible.\r\n2. SMBv1 disabling:  Some message describing if protocol has been disabled as fast as possible.\r\n3. SMBv2 detection:  seems OK\r\n4. SMBv2 disabling:  Some message describing if protocol has been disabled as fast as possible.\r\n5. SMBv3 detection:  Some message describing if protocol is installed or not as fast as possible.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nPS is blecked and must be close by X close windows button\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0",
