The `-SettingsFile` parameter is not listed in the syntax block but it is listed and described below.\r\n\r\n2. Was `-LoadProfile` actually added? For what purpose? It is not listed in the output for PSv6.\r\n\r\n3. The description for `-WorkingDirectory` includes markdown formatting for the \"Set-Location\" example, which is not appropriate for console output.\r\n\r\n```\r\n-WorkingDirectory | -wd\r\n    Sets the working directory at the start of PowerShell given a valid PowerShell directory path.\r\n    Executing `Set-Location -LiteralPath <path>` at startup.\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. The the documentation in about_pwsh.md has been improved with more information and better grammar. We should sync those changes into the code.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
