If you create a new drive named 'root'\r\n`    New-PSDrive -PSProvider filesystem -root / -scope global -name root:`\r\nThen cd into that drive\r\n`    cd \"root:$home\"`\r\ndoing\r\n`    ${root:foo.txt} = 'hi, mom'`\r\n`    Get-Content foo.txt`\r\nworks fine. \r\n\r\nIn fact you can't use '/:' as a drive anywhere. For example, `resolve-path /:` fails with path not found whereas `resolve-path root:` works fine. This appears to be the real issue - that you can't use '/' as a drive name in paths.",

While I understand that this would be a weird concept to Linux people to use something like `dir /:.`, the fact it is listed (by `get-psdrive`) would make me think it should at least work, even though its not needed in that example.",
