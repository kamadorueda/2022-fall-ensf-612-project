Whatever the subtle differences (clear screen, clear buffer+screen, etc) it definitely shouldn't be returning a value.\r\n\r\nAll command output or free values anywhere in a PowerShell function become part of the return value of the function (that decision was taken to copy sh/bash/ksh/etc. behaviour). `Clear-Host` particularly returns a value because it wraps `/user/bin/clear` a native command which works by returning a value.\r\n\r\n`clear` doesn't clear the screen directly, it prints a string expecting the display terminal to clear itself. If you do something to block that, the screen doesn't clear and you get the string instead. The same thing happens in Bash; at a shell prompt:\r\n\r\n    clear                      # screen is cleared\r\n    clear 1>/tmp/test          # screen is not cleared, reset string written to file\r\n\r\n\r\n    result=`clear`             #screen is not cleared, output -> variable\r\n    echo $result               # screen is cleared.\r\n\r\n\r\n    function test { clear; echo \"123\"; }\r\n    test                       # screen is cleared and 123 is output\r\n    result=`test`              # screen is not cleared, no visible output\r\n    echo $result | wc -c       # result variable has 16 characters, not 3\r\n    16\r\n\r\n    echo $result               # screen is cleared, 123 is output\r\n\r\n> that kind of obviates the point of a cross-platform language, doesn't it? :)\r\n\r\nIt seems to behaves like the platform it's running on.

      "body": "I agree, @iSazonov. \r\n\r\n@HumanEquivalentUnit: True, but since PowerShell, unlike Bash, is able to distinguish between to-terminal output and success-stream output, the fix is to write directly to the terminal:\r\n\r\n`${function:Clear-Host}` prints the function definition, and on Unix-like platforms you get:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n& (Get-Command -CommandType Application clear | Select-Object -First 1).Definition\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above writes implicitly to the success output stream, so wrapping it in `[Console]::Write()` fixes the problem:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction Clear-Host {\r\n  [Console]::Write((\r\n    & (Get-Command -CommandType Application clear | Select-Object -First 1).Definition\r\n  ))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`$host.UI.Write()` would work too and is arguably conceptually better, but since `/usr/bin/clear` is being called, the code is terminal (console)-specific anyway.\r\n\r\nTest:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n& { Clear-Host; 'hi' } | Should -Be 'hi'\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note: In PowerShell Core 7.0.0-preview.4 I get a spurious `Suggestion [4,General]: The most similar commands are: New-Object, Tee-Object.` message the first time `Should` is run in the session, but this is unrelated and can be ignored).\r\n\r\n",

On those platforms, you still need to use the `$RawUI` portability APIs. A nice solution would be to actually add a new `RawUI.Clear()` API and then implement that using `Console.Clear()` in the console host but that may end up being a bunch of work...\r\n\r\nCase in point: If you currently execute `Clear-Host` in a remoting session connected to a Unix machine, it prints the following message to stderr (and does nothing else).\r\n\r\n```\r\nTERM environment variable not set.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
