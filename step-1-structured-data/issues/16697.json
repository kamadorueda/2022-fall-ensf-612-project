      "body": "Yep, this is the case for directly calling any .NET method that takes a file or folder path. .NET methods have no awareness of PowerShell's filesystem (or any other) provider. You must use Resolve-Path or similar to get the fully-qualified path to hand to the .NET method.\r\n\r\n.NET's current directory cannot be reliably kept up to date with PowerShell's current session path, because the .NET current directory is process-wide, whereas PowerShell can have many \"current\" directories, each in their own runspace/thread.",
