  "body": "If the Execution Policy is set to AllSigned and you try to import a class based resource signed by an unknown publisher, Import-DSCResource will opt to \"Never run\" software from this publisher.\r\nSince the default option for the authenticode prompt is \"Do not run\", this behaviour is unexpected.\r\n\r\n\"Never run\" causes problems in that it will import the certificate in question in to the Disallowed store of the SYSTEM account. This can lead to a lot of manual cleanup work in case a default signing certificate has been missing from the Trusted Publisher store for unrelated reasons.\r\nIs this really the intended behaviour? Shouldn't DSC select the default option?\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n1. Set Execution Policy to AllSigned\r\n2. Apply a DSC configuration that imports a class based DSC resource signed by an unknown publisher\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nResource is not imported, using the default option \"Do not run\".\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\nResource is not imported, using the option \"Never run\".\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.14393.206\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.14393.206\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n",
