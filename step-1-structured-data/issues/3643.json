  "author": "BrucePay",
  "body": "This change enables globbing (wildcard expansion) against the file system for native commands like /bin/ls. Expansion is only done in the file system. In non-filesystem drives expansion is not done and the pattern is returned unchanged. \r\n\r\nLimitations:\r\n\r\nCurrently quoting is not honored so for a command like `/bin/ls \"*.txt\"`, wildcard expansion will still be done. Adding support for bare word detection will come in a future PR.  Use --% to suppress wildcard expansion e.g. git add --% * \r\n\r\nThis (partially) fixes #954  \r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
