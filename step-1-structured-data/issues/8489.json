  "body": "# Support Question\r\nI've been messing around with a project today and noticed that sometimes my requests fail, I couldn't quite nail it down until I installed Fiddler and saw that in the headers my script was requesting `Expect: 100-continue`, after a bit of digging I also noticed once I login to the web page manually it returns a 200, I just added `-Headers` to my script to also Expect 200, but I would like to know why this is? I never set it up to expect anything before now.\r\n\r\n## Official support\r\n\r\n[PowerShell Support Lifecycle](http://aka.ms/pslifecycle)\r\n\r\n## Community Resources\r\n\r\n[Slack Community Chat](https://powershell.slack.com) - Interactive chat with other PowerShell enthusiasts\r\n[PowerShell.org Forum](https://powershell.org/forums/) - Search or post new general PowerShell usage questions\r\n",

      "body": "@Arefu \r\nCould you provide some command examples that could replicate the issue?\r\n\r\nAlso, can you clarify it the the `Expect:` you saw i fiddler was in the request headers from your client and not in the response headers?\r\n\r\nFinally, can you confirm you still have the problem after having disabled all antivirus, firewalls, and local proxies? Sometimes AV and security software can mess with http request payloads.",
