  "body": "\r\nI am trying to develop a PowerShell Module. When I try to set a connection with my local-deploy server using self-signed certificate, pwsh will throw a exception:\r\n ```\r\nThe SSL connection could not be established, see inner exception. \r\nThe remote certificate is invalid according to the validation procedure\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this module can be used in windows powershell 5.x as  expected, it can correctly set ssl connection with my certificate to send and receive request.\r\n\r\nI use WebHttpHandler to pack a certificate, then new a HttpClient using this handler. \r\nSimple source code:\r\n\r\n ```\r\n public async Task<Response> SendRequest( Uri baseAddress, Request request)\r\n {\r\n...\r\n_handler = new WebRequestHandler();\r\n_handler.ClientCertificates.Add(\r\n                new X509Certificate2(\r\n                    Path.Combine(\r\n                        Path.GetDirectoryName(this.GetType().Assembly.Location),\r\n                        \"TestClientCert.pfx\"),\r\n                    \"password123456\"));\r\n             \r\nvar client = new HttpClient(_handler) { BaseAddress = baseAddress, Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5) };\r\n...\r\nvar resp = await client.SendAsync(msg);\r\nreturn new Response(resp.content...);\r\n\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI use `powershell 6.2.1 in windows 10`\r\nI am so confused the same code run different result in different version PowerShell env. Do you have some idea about that, or some solution to that problem ? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
