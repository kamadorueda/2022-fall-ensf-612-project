  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nModifying ExecutionPolicy with PowerShell 7.2.2 does not work correctly. When I set ExecutionPolicy to Unrestricted using \"Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted\" the RegistrySetting Computer\\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShell\\ExecutionPolicy is still set to \"Restricted\", even after refreshing / rebooting and all ps scripts are blocked. When checking with Get-ExecutionPolicy -List the result is \"Unrestricted\" for local maching and undefined for all other scopes, so obviously the setting is somehow set but does not have any effect\r\n\r\nWhen I do the same using PowerShell 5.1 everything works as expected. \r\n\r\nAlso when running Get-ExecutionPolicy -List in both versions different results are displayed\r\n\r\n![Screenshot 2022-05-02 115035](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2854973/166216231-2b35a68c-3960-4e93-a281-01b729894e96.png)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPowerShell 7.2.2 should identically work as PowerShell 5 when modifying/Listing ExecutionPolicy\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPowerShell 7.2.2 not modifies ExecutionPolicy correctly\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nWindows 10 Professional 19043, Single unmanaged Workstation (not part of a domain or AD)\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n\r\nhttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2854973/166218680-bfb3b0a5-290e-4b54-b665-15d3ea0b05da.mp4\r\n\r\n",

So a file in the the same directory as the executable is a simple way of getting that. \r\n\r\n64 bit and 32 bit Windows PowerShell put these setting in different parts of the registry so execution policy needs to be changed twice to cover both. So there is a precedent for saying two side by side versions do not interfere with each other. \r\n\r\nYou're right that there is an argument that on Windows the settings should go under `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\6` or  `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\7` but there is an equal and opposite argument different platforms should avoid special behaviours.  That is the argument which minimizes the amount of work for implementation and testing :-)  If the policies work correctly the storage mechanism isn't important. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n",

As the msi package is platform agnostic this could easily be configured there. Also I understand your argument for other use cases. But shouldn\u00b4t this be an optional configuration option? Can PowerShell 7 currently be configured to write into the registry similar as PowerShell 5 does? At least the documentation of PowerShell 7 should mention this different behaviour clearly. I assume most people are not aware of the fact that PowerShell 7 does not write to the registry, so all cmdlets which modify the registry in PowerShell 5 are pretty useless if one uses PowerShell 7 as a replacement for 5.",

(The 32 bit MSI will work on 64 bit Windows and is needed in a few situations). \r\n\r\n6 and 7 on Windows do have registry providers so (on Windows) registry commands still do what they always did.  It is simply a question of where PowerShell reads current user and local machine configuration information from when it starts.  AIUI group policy still supported so a Windows version of PowerShell 7 does read the registry for _some_ execution policy \r\n\r\nA Windows-only app _should_ keep its configuration in the registry, but the new Windows Terminal app uses a JSON file so parts of Microsoft don't follow that rule. The unix world has never had a central configuration store so apps there use various sorts of text file.    \r\nShould a cross-platform app use the registry on Windows or use the same config files everywhere?  The case for either is roughly as strong as the other.  Since we use the cmdlets to view/change the settings we probably shouldn't care very much about how things are stored - such things can change between versions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n",

So this is pretty useless\r\n\r\n**PowerShell 7 reads the JSON and Group Policy Settings**. As you have shown:\r\n\r\n-  When you run Set-ExecutionPolicy in 64 bit PowerShell 5 it sets the policy for 64 bit PowerShell 5, but not for 32 bit PowerShell 5 or Powershell 6 and later.  \r\n- When you run Set-ExecutionPolicy in 32 bit PowerShell 5 it sets the policy for 32 bit PowerShell 5, but not for 64 bit PowerShell 5 or Powershell 6 and later.  \r\n- When you run Set-ExecutionPolicy in PowerShell 6 or 7 it sets the policy for that installation of PowerShell 6/7 (there may be more than one). \r\n\r\nAt no time has Set-ExecutionPolicy been a global setting for all different versions of PowerShell. \r\n\r\nIn PowerShell 5 normal users have read-only access to the Registry key holding the machine setting.    \r\nIn PowerShell 6/7 Normal users have read-only access to the JSON file holding the machine setting. \r\n\r\nAs the image below shows running Set-Execution policy changes the json. Changing the JSON causes an issue with an untrusted file in PSReadline, and won't load my unsigned profile. **Clearly the policy IS effective.**  \r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/166689845-6b387e58-03ab-406d-a1cd-fa4e30f40c23.png)\r\n\r\nHere's a second screen shot showing that if you edit the JSON the policy changes - and this is PowerShell 6 \r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16209593/166692508-3acfe148-991d-499f-a824-2a4fd431920a.png)\r\n\r\nNote that this is not supported. The text in the JSON might change, the location of the file might change. In version 8 it could be YAML or XML format, or back in the registry.  The only supported way to read or write the policy is with cmdlet for that version of PowerShell. \r\n\r\n> 2. That\u00b4s not true. All official MS Documentation refers to the powershell for configuring the ExecutionPolicy, which implies that this modifies the appropriate registry settings and that this is supported. Otherwise it would not have any effect\r\n\r\nAll official documentation  that I am aware of **refers to the `set-ExcutionPolicy` cmdlet.** Which sets the policy (via json) for 6/7 and via registry for 5 and earlier. I'm pretty sure there is no official advice to use `reg.exe  <something>` to set set a policy by merging in a .REG file, nor to run `regedit` and navigate to `HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShell\\ExecutionPolicy`,     \r\nnor to use `Get-ItemProperty hklm:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\PowerShell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShell -name ExecutionPolicy`  \r\nbut if you know different please share. \r\n\r\nThere **is** an error in the on-line help which still says the policy is stored in the registry, but does not give a path or recommend accessing the registry directly. \r\n\r\n> 3. Could you please advise what needs to be configured so PowerShell 7 ExecutionPolicy cmdlet modifies the appropriate registry settings\r\n\r\n**PowerShell 7 doesn't get its execution policy from the registry but from a JSON file.**  there is no \"appropriate registry setting\" for execution policy in PS 7.   If the cmdlet changed a registry setting pwsh.exe would still look at the JSON not the registry.  You can hack the registry for the PowerShell 5 policy setting from PowerShell 7 (e.g. with` Set-ItemProperty`)  I don't know how many different ways I can put that. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
