Using `Start-Job` results in a failed job. The problem is that ~/.dotnet/tools/.store/powershell/7.2.6/powershell/7.2.6/tools/net6.0/any/unix/pwsh is a Linux ELF executable, not Mach-O. If I move ~/.dotnet/tools/.store/powershell/7.2.6/powershell/7.2.6/tools/net6.0/any/unix/pwsh out of the way and replace it with a symlink to ~/.dotnet/tools/pwsh, then `Start-Job` works as expected.\r\n\r\nI noticed that ~/.dotnet/tools/.store/powershell/7.2.6/powershell/7.2.6/tools/net6.0/any/unix gets prepended to `$Env:PATH` when `pwsh` starts up, so the `pwsh` in that location is the first one found in a path search. I tried altering my path to remove that directory, but `Start-Job` still uses the `pwsh` in that location. Only replacing the ELF binary with a link to the Mach-O binary fixes the problem, although I don't know if this might result in other issues (I haven't run into any yet).\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nPS> Start-Job -ScriptBlock {}\r\nId  Name  PSJobTypeName  State    HasMoreData  Location   Command\r\n--  ----  -------------  -----    -----------  --------   -------\r\n1   Job1  BackgroundJob  Running  True         localhost\r\n\r\nPS> Get-Job\r\nId  Name  PSJobTypeName  State      HasMoreData  Location   Command\r\n--  ----  -------------  -----      -----------  --------   -------\r\n1   Job1  BackgroundJob  Completed  False        localhost\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPS> Start-Job -ScriptBlock {}\r\nId  Name  PSJobTypeName  State   HasMoreData  Location   Command\r\n--  ----  -------------  -----   -----------  --------   -------\r\n1   Job1  BackgroundJob  Failed  False        localhost  \r\n\r\nPS> Receive-Job 1\r\nOpenError: [localhost] An error occurred while starting the background process.
