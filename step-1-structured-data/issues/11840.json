  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nNot sure if there is common way to set configuration for powershell, I guess everybody reinvent this wheel. $Profile (hard to manage programatically), env variable (too simple ), probably random json/xml. C# apps usually use appsetings.json (app.config), what if we do the same for powershell? For example, let user create appsettings.json file in the profile directory, and PS would generate some automatic variable (say $Configuration). In addition/instead this could be implemented on the module level. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details \r\nI guess it's pretty much implemented in Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration, just need to add reference and put it all together.\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n    var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()\r\n        .AddJsonFile(\"path/to/appsettings.json\", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)\r\n        .Build();\r\n\r\n    Console.WriteLine(config[\"MailConfig:smtp\"]);\r\n```\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
