  "body": "I think this might be a bug of some sort.  I downloaded the PowerShell that just came out for OS X  v6.0.0-alpha.9   and updated the Visual studio code version to the latest 0.7.0.  When I try to run simple script I get the following Error \"Debug adapter process has terminated unexpectedly\" if I press F5 or if I select a line and press F8 I get command I get error \" 'PowerShell.RunSelection' not found\"\n\nunder vscode/extensions/ms-vscode.PowerShell-0.7.0/logs the \"DebugAdapterClient.log\" is blank.  the\nPowerShell.log can be seen here https://gist.github.com/robbiepc30/38e6afca1f4ff6a63fa475a783473892\n",
