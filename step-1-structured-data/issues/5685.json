      "body": "It seems as any time the session closes powershell will hang. If you don't close the session you can create new sessions but when the script is finished it hangs (probably when it tries to close the session in it's dispose method). Even if I try to exit the session from within with something like\r\n```\r\n$Session = New-PSSession -ComputerName xxx -Credential $Credential -Authentication Negotiate\r\nInvoke-Command -Session $Session -ScriptBlock {\r\n    Write-Host 'Test'\r\n    Exit\r\n}\r\n```\r\nIt immediately hangs.\r\nI've been forced to leave my sessions open and append `kill $PID` at the last lines of my script to workaround this issue which is truly horrific.",
