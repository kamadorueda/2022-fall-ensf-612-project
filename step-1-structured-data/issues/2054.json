[HTTP RFC 7231](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-4.3.1) describes that a content-body is allowed even though the response of the webserver might be \n\n>    A payload within a GET request message has no defined semantics;\n>    sending a payload body on a GET request might cause some existing\n>    implementations to reject the request.\n\nThis is making it difficult to interface with various RESTful API's like InfoBlox and ElasticSearch that rely on JSON payloads for retrieving data.\n## Steps to reproduce\n\n$uri = 'http://www.microsoft.com'\n$payload = @{Microsoft='loves linux'}\n$result = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $uri -Body ($payload | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType 'application/json' -Method Get\n## Expected behavior\n\nHTTP OK\n## Actual behavior\n\nInvoke-WebRequest : Cannot send a content-body with this verb-type.\n",
