  "body": "While working on the sxs module path, I found some method names are intuitive, for example, `GetDscModulePath()` actually returns the `Program Files` shared module path, `GetSystemWideModulePath()` actually returns the pshome module path. Those method need to be renamed.\n- [x] Refactor method names related to module path calculation\n- [x] The code that detects if a module path is PSHome module path derived from parent process needs to be smarter, not only check `powershell` file in the parent folder, but maybe check `powershell.deps.json` file as well, and also the short folder name of the path should be `Modules`. The current detection logic casued a test to fail in Travis CI, see #1792\n- [x] Add more SxS module path tests\n- [ ] ~~Think about the name `inbox` of `Platform.IsInbox` property. Do we need a better name?~~ `Platform.IsInbox` is an internal property, and it's well commented to clarify its meaning. We will keep this name unless there is a big concern about it.\n",
