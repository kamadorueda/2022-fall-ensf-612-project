      "body": "@kvprasoon The subsequent pwsh sessions will show the notification of rc.3, right?\r\nThis is because the pwsh on your machine hasn't got a chance to find that rc.3 is released.\r\nThe rc.2 release was previously detected and cached locally. When pwsh starts, it shows the cached information and then query for the latest information, which will be used the next time pwsh starts.\r\n\r\nFrom the user's perspective, you have been seeing this rc.2 message for quite a while.\r\nEven though for this startup, it shows an out-dated information, the correct information will be shown on the next pwsh startup. So there won't be much delay before you see the latest update information.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's called out in the [RFC](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/5-Final/RFC0052-Notification-On-Version-Update.md#non-goals) the following is not a goal:\r\n> Notification shows up right after a new version of `pwsh` is released.",
