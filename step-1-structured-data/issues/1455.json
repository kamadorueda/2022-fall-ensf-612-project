  "body": "From the link @ https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/building/linux.md, supposedly the developers should be able to build powershell from the source code. Recently, I tried it out, and found the below issues, \n1. For \"Environment\" section, it should be clear to the developers that the current instruction actually only works for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, for other newer version, dev will hit the below errors due to the missing binaries,  \n\nReading state information... Done\nPackage libicu52 is not available, but is referred to by another package.\nThis may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or\nis only available from another source\n\nE: Package 'libicu52' has no installation candidate\n(Reading database ... 59652 files and directories currently installed.)\nPreparing to unpack ./powershell_0.6.0-1_amd64.deb ...\nUnpacking powershell (0.6.0-1) over (0.6.0-1) ...\ndpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of powershell:\npowershell depends on libunwind8; however:\n  Package libunwind8 is not installed.\npowershell depends on libicu52; however:\n  Package libicu52 is not installed.\n\ndpkg: error processing package powershell (--install):\ndependency problems - leaving unconfigured\nErrors were encountered while processing:\npowershell\n1. For \"Working with PowerShell repository\" section, \n   a. In git clone command, It will be nice to let developers know that if they use the two-factor authentication for their git hub acount, they need to use access token as password, instead of their normal passwords when the authentication is prompted for git clone. It could be obvious, but it would be helpful to remind. \n   b. If they don't add --recursive in git clone, or there is some error during --recursive git clone. They need to clone the submodules manually. They need to cd to PowerShell directory first, then run the below two commands, \n   git submodule init\n   git submodule update\n\nPlease make sure installing all the submodules successfully, else, building using Start-PSBuild later will fail. \n1. For \"Toolchain Setup\" section, the below bash commands do not work, \n\n\"GITHUB_TOKEN=<replace with your token>\n./tools/download.sh\"\n\nYou need to call \"export GITHUB_TOKEN=<replace with your token>\" first, then \"./tools/download.sh\"\n",

      "body": "Do you have suggested language for being more clear than: \n\n> These instructions are written assuming the Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, since that's the distro the team uses. The build module works on a best-effort basis for other distributions.\n\nFor all of the authorization stuff, I think the only real inaccuracy we have is the GitHub token stuff. You're right, it needs an `export`. We should just fix that one. \n\nFortunately, none of the 2FA or token stuff is relevant at all when the repo goes public. :) \n",
