      "body": "Multiple ways you can do it. \r\n\r\nSince you are on Windows, the easiest way is re-use the format-xml file from Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\n- Copy `C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\FileSystem.format.ps1xml` to your profile directory (or anywhere convenient) \r\n- View definitions begin at line 57, and you only need to change the first view .\r\n- Line 63-66  Has a groupBy Section.  Delete it and save the file\r\n- `Update-FormatData -PrependPath <<path>>\\FileSystem.format.ps1xml` will put this formatting in with higher precedence than the build in format.\r\n- Add that command to your profile to make the change in future sessions.\r\n\r\nHere's how it looks for me.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#512 PS7 ~\\Documents\\PowerShell> Update-FormatData -PrependPath .\\FileSystem.format.ps1xml\r\n#513 PS7 ~\\Documents\\PowerShell> dir .\\profile.ps1\r\n\r\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                 -------------         ------ ----\r\nla---         23/02/2022     10:36              0 profile.ps1\r\n```\r\n\r\n",

I think it was at the change from 5 to 6 the XML was moved into compiled files, you can the source in the code tree but the it it isn't in the same XML format, so you can work out what has been done (and you can use `get-formatData` to do the same thing) but it doesn't give you the XML to implement it. \r\nThere's documentation here https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/format/format-schema-xml-reference?view=powershell-7.2  I find the easiest thing to do is to find something in PowerShell 5 xml files which does what I want, and cannibalize it. \r\n\r\nIf you're getting bracketed folder names that sounds like you have more than one thing contributing to the output. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/media/logos/logo-powershell-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/developer/format/format-schema-xml-reference\">Format Schema XML Reference - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>Format Schema XML Reference</div></blockquote>",
