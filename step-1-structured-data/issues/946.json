  "body": "Many things have been added .NET Core that may deprecate our own native code in the `libpsl-native` library. We should examine what functionality we use, and what can be deprecated.\n\nFor instance: `MachineName` is now [available](https://dotnet.github.io/api/System.Environment.html#System_Environment_MachineName), which could possibly replace [`GetComputerName`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/libpsl-native/src/getcomputername.cpp).\n\nIdeally the entirety of our native library could disappear eventually, but for now we can at least shrink it.\n",
