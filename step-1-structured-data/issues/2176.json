  "body": "Problem: Native (non-object) pipes between native processes are ~1000X faster versus PowerShell object pipes. This is especially problematic for us systems people who like to work on 500MB-5GB files routinely.\n\nProposed solution: Automatically detect 2 native processes (neither is a function nor commandlet), and use a direct system pipe.\n\nTimings from my box:\n\n1) Powershell object pipe\n\n```\nPS> time { cat bigfile.txt | measure -line }\nMinutes           : 15\nSeconds           : 14\nTotalSeconds      : 914.4296154\n```\n\n2) Using cygwin utilities\n\n```\nPS> time { FastPipe { C:\\cygwin\\bin\\cat.exe bigfile.txt | c:\\cygwin\\bin\\wc -l } }\nTotalSeconds      : 1.7950218\n```\n\n*FastPipe is a hack I wrote that stringifies the scriptblock and passes it to cmd.exe for its faster raw pipes. Perhaps this is the best solution for now?\n",
