ConvertTo-Json acknowledges JsonIgnoreAttributes but does not honor JsonPropertyAttributes.  have some objects that are decorated with these attributes and serialize differently between ASP.NET and PowerShell. I've had to make a hacked version of ConvertTo-Json to support these attributes. For me, it results in a difference in casing which causes my JavaScript code to fail. \r\n\r\nI propose that the JSON cmdlets honor the JsonPropertyAttributes placed on properties. \r\n\r\n",

This probably needs to be new cmdlets. Because pretty much everything we do at this point is a breaking change in the current cmdlets. \r\n\r\nAs for fixing this in the current cmdlets... I have some (bad) ideas such as re-inventing the wheel to inspect the attributes on the object properties.. Maybe before we make the object ditcionary, we test the object for Json related attributes and pass the object directly to NewtonSoft... but that has depth issues.",

In theory, the new cmdlets would \"just work\" in most cases, but obviously, there would be subtle differences.",
