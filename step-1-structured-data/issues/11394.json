      "body": "So... I expect the first question they will ask is \"well how many spaces do YOU think a tab should occupy?\" And the problem is that not everyone will agree. I think it *is* likely that a significant majority of PowerShell users would prefer 4, not 8, but I doubt PowerShell is actually getting involved here, and it's left to the terminal to decide how big a tab is. I don't know if there is a way to configure that on conhost... maybe you could check on microsoft/terminal and let us know.",

PowerShell **did** decide where to put the `^ this is where the error occurred` marker, so it **did** make a judgement call about how big a tab is. And it should apply that same judgement in the output by translating the tabs to however many spaces it used when deciding where to put the marker, to prevent different console settings from messing things up.",
