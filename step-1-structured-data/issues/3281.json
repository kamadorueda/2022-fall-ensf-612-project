  "body": "Add support to ShellExecute in powershell core when it's running on Windows full SKUs.\r\nUpdated `Get-Help -Online`, `Invoke-Item` and `Start-Process` to support start a process using ShellExecute on powershell core on windows full SKUs.\r\n\r\nTODO: In .NET Core, managed threads are all eagerly initialized with MTA mode, so to call `ShellExecuteEx` from a STA thread, we need to create a native thread using `CreateThread` function and initialize COM with STA on that thread. In #3281, we are calling `ShellExecuteEx` directly on MTA thread, and it works for things like opening a folder in File Explorer, opening a file with the application that is associated with its extension in shell, opening URL in web browser and etc, but it's not guaranteed to work in all ShellExecution scenarios. #2969 will be used to track the \"invoke-on-STA-thread\" work.",
