  "body": "Since version `6.2.0-preview.2` all the files listed in `FileList` are loaded when the module is loaded.\r\n\r\nThis is change in behavior caused by PR #8073 which was done to support a customer issue about loading assemblies from module folder first, before looking at GAC.\r\n\r\nHence, the behavior in `6.2.x` and `7.0.x` is different from Windows PowerShell. \r\n\r\nI believe the current behavior is wrong and should be fixed. But, since it as release in `6.2.x` and `7.0.x` it will be a breaking change. \r\n\r\nIf we decide to not fix it, it might make moving from Windows PowerShell to PowerShell 7 more difficult.\r\n\r\nI would like opinion from committee about fixing the issue in `7.1` and whether it should be back ported to `7.0.x` and `6.2.x`\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nLoad a module with managed assemblies in FileList in the psd1\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$filesBefore = [System.AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()\r\nImport-Module <>\r\n$filesAfter = [System.AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies()\r\n Compare-Object -ReferenceObject $filesBefore -DifferenceObject $filesAfter\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nFiles in FileList should not be loaded\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nFiles in FileList are loaded.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19635\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
