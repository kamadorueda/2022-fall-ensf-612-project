  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\r\n\r\nGood morning\r\n\r\nit's great to have many PowerShell users - it's a great 'tool', thanks a lot for your great work!\r\n\r\n### \u2026 but it's **very** annoying, that all those PowerShell users get this notification:\r\n```\r\n   A new PowerShell stable release is available: \u2026\r\n   Upgrade now, or check out the release page at:\r\n   https://aka.ms/PowerShell-Release?tag=\u2026\r\n```\r\n\r\n### The problem is, that most Users will start this process:\r\n1. _\"A new release? - great!\"_\r\n2. But: _\"How can I upgrade PowerShell??\"_\r\n3. _\"\u2026 ok, I'll upgrade it anytime later, I don't have time to ask google\"_\r\n\r\n### Therefore: please tell how PowerShell can be upgraded in the upgrade notification!\r\n\r\nSomething like this:\r\n```\r\n   A new PowerShell stable release is available: \u2026\r\n   Start upgrade by calling: \u2026\r\n   The Release Notes: https://aka.ms/PowerShell-Release?tag=\u2026\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, kind regards,\r\nThomas\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n_No response_",

However, there are a number of ways PowerShell could be installed.  So the upgrade process isn't really a single upgrade process as it depends on how you installed PowerShell: direct MSI download, Windows Store, winget, Chocolatey, dotnet global tool, apt, yum, snap, homebrew, etc.  \r\n\r\nRelated to #8663",

I've eventually found the (huge) table of links to download the many version of installers somewhere in the middle. \r\nI would expect to run the command \"upgrade\" and the smart software that knows I need an upgrade, knows the version I am running, and knows where to find the new stuff just ask if I want Latest, Stable or Preview and start the download itself. That would have been neat.\r\nWhy not dream that it tells me \"there is a new stable version X.Y.Z available, do you want to install it [Y/N]?\"?",

Note when you run it, you have the option of updating via MS Update (ensure it's checked).\r\nIf you have enabled updating via MU, then can just wait. It takes a couple of weeks after release to GitHub before MSFT can get it over to MU. I am not sure WHY it takes so long, but it does work. ",
