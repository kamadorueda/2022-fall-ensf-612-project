  "body": "The [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/start-process?view=powershell-7) for `Start-Process` mentions that executing the child process in a separate window is the default behavior, and the `-NoNewWindow` parameter exists to prevent it. Indeed, this is how it behaves on Windows.\r\n\r\nThe same documentation also contains a note that on Linux, the `-UseNewEnvironment` should be used to achieve the same behavior. There is no explicit mention of macOS.\r\n\r\nI'm building a cross-platform solution where a requirement is for the new window behavior to be consistent across both Windows and macOS, but based on my testing so far, the child process is always executed within the current terminal window on macOS.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOne of the following:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nStart-Process pwsh-preview -WorkingDirectory ~/Temp -ArgumentList \"-File .\\SomeScript.ps1\" -Wait\r\nStart-Process pwsh-preview -WorkingDirectory ~/Temp -ArgumentList \"-File .\\SomeScript.ps1\" -UseNewEnvironment -Wait\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThe external script SomeScript.ps1 should be executed in a new terminal window.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nThe external script SomeScript.ps1 is instead executed in the same terminal window.\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Darwin 19.0.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.0.0: Wed Oct 23 18:29:05 PDT 2019; root:xnu-6153.41.3~44/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
