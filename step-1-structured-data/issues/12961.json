  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nTake a look at this guide:\r\nhttps://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/08/working-with-environment-variables-in-node-js.html\r\n\r\nThe example they used:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nPORT=9999 node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich sets `$env:PORT` to `9999` for the subprocess, `node`.\r\n\r\nThis works in bash, zsh, and fish... and is used _everywhere_. But it doesn't work in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nThe equivalent in PowerShell would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPS > $env:PORT = 9999\r\nPS > node server.js\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut that would set `$env:PORT` for the _current_ process as well which could cause issues.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nIf possible, we should try to support this syntax exactly. I couldn't find a specific doc, but this SO sums it up well:\r\nhttps://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/392050/set-environment-variable-for-subshell",
