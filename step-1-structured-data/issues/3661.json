  "body": "Fixes #2799\r\n\r\nIn the process of normalizing a relative path, PowerShell checks to see\r\nsee if the path exists, which it does by invoking `Directory.EnumerateFiles(directory, filename);`\r\n\r\nOn Unix platforms, if the filename contains globbing patterns, such as `[ab]`,\r\n`EnumerateFiles` (and `EnumerateDirectories`) will perform the globbing. Using\r\nglobbing patterns, a file named `file[txt].txt` is reported as not existing.\r\n\r\nThis fix changes the file-existence test on Unix to use a native function\r\ninstead of either of the Directory.EnumerateXXX functions.\r\n\r\nThis affects the `Move-Item`, `Remove-Item`, `Rename-Item` and `Copy-Item` cmdlets. This change does not affect the `New-Item` cmdlet, as it is able to create files with names containing Unix globbing characters.\r\n",
