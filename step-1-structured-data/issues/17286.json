Because resources for new features is limited, we feel this may be a good time for the community to take advantage of the recent [Custom Remote Connections](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell-RFC/blob/master/Archive/Draft/RFC0063-Custom-Remote-Connections.md).  \r\n\r\nThe community could create a new custom remote connection module, for SSH connections, that supports more desired SSH features, such as certificate authentication.",
