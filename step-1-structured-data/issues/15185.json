We should update the help doc to capture this.\r\n\r\nFor `switch ($list)`, like @SeeminglyScience said, it's because the enumerator is a value type, but I observed different behaviors between when the `switch` statement is in a local scope and when it's in the global scope. See below code snippets:\r\n\r\n```\r\n### make $switch unoptimized (by running directly in global scope) -- will store in PSVariable ###\r\n\r\n$testData = 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n$switchIsNull = $true\r\n\r\n$list = [System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]::new()\r\n$list.AddRange($testData)\r\n$output = switch ($list) {\r\n    (2) {\r\n        $_\r\n        $switchIsNull = $null -eq $switch\r\n        if ($switch -and $switch.MoveNext()) {\r\n            $switch.Current\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n$output\r\n> 2\r\n> 1\r\n\r\n### ====== Versus ====== ###\r\n\r\n### Make $switch optimized (by running within a new local scope) -- will store in local tuples ###\r\n\r\n& {\r\n    $testData = 1, 2, 3, 4\r\n    $switchIsNull = $true\r\n\r\n    $list = [System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]::new()\r\n    $list.AddRange($testData)\r\n    $output = switch ($list) {\r\n        (2) {\r\n            $_\r\n            $switchIsNull = $null -eq $switch\r\n            if ($switch -and $switch.MoveNext()) {\r\n                $switch.Current\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    $output\r\n}\r\n> 2\r\n> 3\r\n```\r\nAs is called out in the code snippets, the difference is [how `$switch` is stored](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/170a226689f8d1d095d74be8d1f40907b3961d75/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/parser/Compiler.cs#L5196-L5203):\r\n- when it's stored in `PSVariable`, we got a copy of the value type enumerator, and thus see `2, 1` as the output\r\n- when it's stored in local tuples, it looks it's referencing the same boxed value of the enumerator, and thus we see `2, 3` as the output.",

Thanks\r\n\r\n@daxian-dbw  Actually `$switch` with `-file` doesn't work because I never got around to implementing it in V1 and it never showed up on the radar again.  Implementing it would be a good thing.\r\n\r\n@powercode WRT skipping lines, while `$switch` doesn't currently work with `-file`,  as a workaround, you can just not match a line and continue iterating:\r\n```powershell\r\n# Return all the lines containing  \"^ *function\"\r\nswitch -file $profile -regex { \"^ *function\" { $_ } }\r\n```\r\nIf you want to skip (or keep) multiple lines, you can do something like:\r\n```powershell\r\n# Return the function line followed by some context lines (doesn't work for short functions)\r\nswitch -file $profile -regex { {$num} {$num--; \">> $_\"}  \"^ *function\" { $num = 3; $_ } }\r\n```\r\nYou could also use the `continue` keyword to skip to the next line. (I'm sure you know all this but others might not).",
