      "body": "> I can't enter a new PSSession within an exist PSSession\r\n\r\nPowerShell used to restrict double hop within the Enter-PSSession cmdlet.  However, this restriction was removed in PowerShell version 6-something by I think @SteveL-MSFT.  Invoke-Command always allowed a double hop.\r\n\r\nHowever, Windows OS itself prevents a second hop since the WinRM remoting session is based on Kerberos credential-less log on.  So there is no way to do a second hop without providing credentials, either via credssp or PSCredential.  But this is not recommended since the credentials passed to the target machine are vulnerable even though an attempt is made to be keep them secure.",
