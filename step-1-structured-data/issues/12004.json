Some fixes for 6.2.4:\r\n\r\n- Retarget the project to netcoreapp2.1 and rebuild it (making sure you import the new DLL and not the old one)\r\n- Retarget to netstandard2.0 and rebuild it\r\n\r\nThe first will allow you to target PS 6 and 7, the second will allow you to target PS 5.1 and up, but is harder to get right, since you can only support .NET 4.6.1 and up with .NET Standard and will need to include netstandard.dll (from the NETStandard.Library NuGet package) in your module and structure it to load the right binaries on the right platforms",

Typically though, NuGet libraries are pretty good about being written for netstandard2.0",
