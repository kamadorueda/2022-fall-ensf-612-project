I tried to start one, two... but it was not accepted.\r\n\r\nRight now the build is done by Start-PSBuild from Build.psm1 \r\nThis consists of several phases that are implemented by this script:\r\n1. dotnet restore\r\n2. build TypeCatalog\r\n3. build resources\r\n4. dotnet compile\r\n5. restore psmodules\r\n6. I may have missed something. In addition, there are non-trivial scripts that do packaging.\r\n\r\nMy intention was to move most of these steps into csproj so as not to depend on pwsh and build ps script(s).\r\nTheir argument was that it's easier for us to write a build script than to support csproj. Although I think there is an acceptable compromise.",

It *seems* to work, but there are still [a few issues](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/alpine/aports/-/merge_requests/36941) needing fixing before inclusion in the release repos.\r\n\r\nAs I don't use `powershell`, I do not know how to fully test its general functionnality.
