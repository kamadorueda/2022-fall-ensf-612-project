  "body": "Keeping the existing PowerShell logic, the profiles  profile.ps1 and <ShellId>_profile.ps1  aka PSL_profile.ps1 for our host   are loaded from the PowerShell library folder and from the  ProductNameForDirectory  folder, which is   WindowsPowerShell.  Making this a bit more Linux simply entailed changing the folder to .powershell, so that the user profiles are loaded from   .powershell  profile.ps1,PSL_profile.ps1  and the  system wide  profiles are loaded from ... lib powershell  profile.ps1,PSL_profile.ps1 .
