  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nNote: This scenario is exotic, but the motto is: if you allow it syntactically, even though it doesn't make sense, people will try it and wonder why it doesn't work - see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/69306144/45375).\r\n\r\nA `[ref]` type constraint cannot be meaningfully combined with other type constraints (because it is the type of the _value being assigned_ that invariably determines the type argument to the associated generic, non-public type used behind the scenes; also, the resulting instance's `.Value` property is still `object`-typed, so the instance can be modified to contain a value of _any type_).\r\n\r\nThere already _is_ a check that enforces that _syntactically_:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS> [ref] [string] $foo = '...'\r\n\r\nParserError:\r\nLine |\r\n   1 |  [ref] [string] $foo = '...'\r\n     |  ~~~~~\r\n     | Cannot use [ref] with other types in a type constraint.\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this check isn't being applied to _parameter declarations_, even though it should:\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction foo {\r\n  param(\r\n      [ref] [string] $Bar\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe function declaration should fail.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe function declaration unexpectedly succeeds, which is problematic in two respects:\r\n\r\n* It makes a false promise of constraining the by-reference value to type `[string]`.\r\n\r\n* It _fails_ if you bind the parameter with a _named_ argument, for the reasons detailed by @iisresetme in the answer to the linked Stack Overflow post.\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.9\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",
