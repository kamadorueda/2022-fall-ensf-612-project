The \"Many Linux distributions\" entry which references Snapcraft has also been moved into the supported platforms table as we've (I work on the Snapcraft team) confirmed the PowerShell snap is working across all Snap compatible distributions.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively",

      "body": "Yeah, we obviously love Snap, but I think we'd want to do a full test pass across Ubuntu distros using the Snap before we move them all over.\r\n\r\nAlso, has Snap been pushed into the older LTS versions as part of servicing? Or do you have any kind of idea what percent of users are pulling it in? My hypothesis is that folks on older LTS are less likely to want new dependencies (eg. Snap), but I don't have any real data there.\r\n\r\nLastly, the \"more Linux distros\" line makes sense to me in principle, and I feel like we went through the formatting and wording already with AppImage. Could we pull that up and see if it makes sense to match what we had there? ",
