  "body": "<sup>Related: #6681</sup>\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrently, you cannot _positionally_ specify an output file for `Export-FormatData`, even though it is typically the only (non-switch) parameter, and other export-/file-writing cmdlets you _do_ allow you to specify the target file positionally.\r\n\r\nI'd expect all of the following forms to be equivalent:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n... | Export-FormatData foo.format.ps1xml  # !! NOT supported: positional out-file argument\r\n... | Export-FormatData -Path foo.format.ps1xml\r\n... | Export-FormatData -LiteralPath foo.format.ps1xml\r\n```\r\n\r\n~~Also, given that `-Path` doesn't support wildcards, there's no need for a separate parameter set, and so `-Path` can simply be made an _alias_ of `-LiteralPath`.~~ (`-Path`, perhaps surprisingly, does support wildcard expressions, as long as they resolve to a _single_ file.)\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nWritten as of:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.2\r\n```\r\n",
