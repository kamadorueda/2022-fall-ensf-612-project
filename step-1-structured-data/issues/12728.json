The difficulty here is that there's not really a good solution to solve this other than perhaps going back and overwriting the header in the file a bunch of times if the cmdlet finds extra properties during processing that aren't present on the first object... That also comes with performance overhead, as inspecting every object's properties and comparing them to the base set is not necessarily cheap. You go from one set of property lookups per pipeline to as many property lookups as there are objects, and that gets quite expensive very quickly and will slow down processing quite a bit.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I'm all for solving it, I think it should be solvable.

I was asking in general about PowerShell -- not just in regard to JSON on arrays or hashtables. Maybe it's my fault. I've been using JavaScript for 20 years, so that's \"normal\". When I use another language, I expect it to \"work like JS\", but maybe it doesn't. It's tricky when two languages seem to do the same thing, but there's subtle (or not to subtle) differences. E.g. https://gabrielsroka.github.io/JavaScript-vs-PowerShell.htm (not complete, of course)\r\n\r\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"https://gabrielsroka.github.io/JavaScript-vs-PowerShell.htm\">JavaScript vs. PowerShell</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
