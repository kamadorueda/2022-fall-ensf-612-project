My Windows 11 machine lists ConfigDefenderPerformance, Dism, Get-NetView, Kds, NetQos, PcsvDevice, PKI, Whea and WindowsUpdate as missing in 7.2.2 and  5.1 adds  ConfigDefender, HostNetworkingService,  StorageBusCache, VMDirectStorage  - which I'm assuming PowerShell 7 won't load.

      "body": "Hi @meyerovb! This issue is not about how to upgrade Powershell. There are several ways to do that, but none of them require running `Update-Help` or doing anything else we are talking about here. One way to upgrade PowerShell from a CLI is to use `winget`. However, this assumes you are on Windows, and you may need to install it first. Additionally, there are other things to keep in mind if you are scripting an upgrade - for example, the installer will need to close all your existing PS sessions (including the one that launched `winget`) or it will require a reboot when you're done.\r\n\r\nIf you do have `winget` and just want to perform the easiest upgrade possible, I'd recommend starting a `cmd` prompt (not PowerShell) and running `winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell --source winget --exact --interactive`. Using `cmd` simplifies things because if you run `winget` (or any PowerShell installer) from inside PowerShell, then that PowerShell session will have to be shut down during the installation process. You can avoid this by using a different shell, like `cmd`.\r\n\r\nIf your needs go beyond that, please start another issue in this repo to discuss exactly what you need to do.\r\n\r\n(FYI: this is @sql-sith, one of the commenters from before ... I just didn't switch back to my personal account)",

However, my opinion is that it's more important to get the help that is available instead of allowing me to hide legitimate messages telling me that I've failed to update help that is available. If we are going to do that, we might as well just have `Update-Help` ignore all errors. An example of a module that might wind up on the \"block list\" when it shouldn't be there is PSRead(L|l)ine. People would be really tempted to add it just to make the errors go away, but this would be a disservice to the community because that help is actually available. Our fix should make the help available, not just let users ignore the error telling them that PowerShell failed to get the update for them.\r\n\r\nTo be more specific, in addition to giving options to squelch errors, I think it would be good to add more little intelligence to how potential upgrade modules are matched. Let me explain a proposal as a starting point for discussion.\r\n\r\nSuppose that there is a signed module from author X called Abc, with version 1, and another signed module, also from author X, called ABC, with version 2. In this case, if you ask PowerShell to find modules named `abc`, it will tell you about both of these versions, even though `abc` does not match the case of either release. Using everyone's favorite example, PSRead(L|l)ine, I can search for `psreadline` in lower case and get back matches that are not lowercase, even in Linux:\r\n```\r\nGet-Module -Name PSReadLine -ListAvailable -All | Select-Object -Property Name, Version | Where-Object Version -ne \"0.0\"\r\n\r\nName       Version\r\n----       -------\r\nPSReadLine 2.1.0\r\nPSReadline 2.0.0\r\n```\r\nIt is an inconsistent user experience to have this consistently case-insensitive policy changed when we run `Update-Help`. \r\n\r\nSo I think that the best solution has two parts:\r\n\r\n1. Make `Update-Help` case-insensitive with respect to module names, so that `PSReadline` matches `PSReadLine`, as it should in the context of the PowerShell user experience; and\r\n2. Also implement a block list, and repopulate it with modules and versions that the PowerShell team knows to be \"terminal,\" meaning that they do not , and will not/cannot work with `Update-Help`. \r\n\r\nThe end state would be that if I have help installed for `PSReadline 2.0.0` and there is help available for `PSReadLine 2.1.0`, running `Update-Help -Module PSReadLine` should succeed (no matter how the user capitalizes `PSReadLine`) and there should be a list of known \"offenders\" that `Update-Help` will not generate errors for if they fail to process successfully, with users able to append to that list.\r\n",

      "body": "@theJasonHelmick  Some sort of block list would provide relief from the symptoms \r\n\r\nHowever the right fix is that any module which ships as part of Windows, but not from the PowerShell team gets its house in order and not ship with a broken link.  Having one part of Microsoft shipping things to hide other parts' bugs is masking the problem not fixing it.  If we use  `ConfigDefenderPerformance`  as an example: it has a link, http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=390762 which gives a 404 error.  Either whoever owns that link needs to figure out why it isn't going to the right place and fixes it  OR the owners `ConfigDefenderPerformance`  need to add something to the next cumulative windows update to move from 1.0 to 1.0.1 and have different, working link . I'm hoping someone from the PowerShell team has filed bugs internally for all the modules known to have broken help links.  \r\n\r\nMasking it while that happens is good (and addresses modules - MSFT or otherwise - which won't ever get updated) but the masking process needs to handle the link being fixed or a new version being made available. \r\n\r\n\n\n<blockquote><div><strong><a href=\"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=390762\">404 - File or directory not found.</a></strong></div></blockquote>",
