With beta 5 I am able to use PowerShell SSH remoting to connect from by Ubuntu16 machine to Windows 10 and vice versa.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that ssh.exe works correctly.  It makes me think that PowerShell is starting ssh.exe process without needed permissions.  Are you running PowerShell in any unusual way, like under a different account that doesn't have permissions to access the known_hosts file?",

This is a Ubuntu Desktop I've build since last July 2016.\r\nEvery time, I upgrade PowerShell Core in Ubuntu, I go for the exercise of redoing openssh-win32 on my Windows 10. This is all workgroup environment I've setup for Demo purpose. \r\n\r\nThere has been few changes in Windows 10 such a the SSH Proxy/Broker Services which I have them turned off in order to allow ssh/ssh-agent not to compete with it. \r\n\r\nI mean this was working in Beta4.  I will try a few more things as it may be on the Windows 10 OpenSSh side.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n",
