It's a bit of extra code beyond the cmdlet itself, but shouldn't be insanely complicated...\r\n\r\nIf you need more to go on, ping me tomorrow morning and I'll revisit this in code properly. :)",

P/Invoke is another way to go about it, but you need to branch out to some C# to have that work at the moment. ",
