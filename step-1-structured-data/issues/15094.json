  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nCurrently, when .psd1 is malformed and I use `Import-PowerShellDataFile`, I get a generic error:\r\n```\r\nImport-PowerShellDataFile: The file '<file>.psd1' could not be parsed as a PowerShell Data File.\r\n```\r\nThis doesn't really help with finding the syntax error. I'd prefer if a normal syntax error would be returned, as with `.`, `&`, `Import-Module` and any other PowerShell file, which clearly shows location of the error.",
