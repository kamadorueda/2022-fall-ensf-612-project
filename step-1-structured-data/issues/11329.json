It will use `%PATH%` for spawning shells, and will launch the store version of powershell if its execution alias shows up earlier in `%PATH%` than any other version.\r\n\r\nThere is also a version-agnostic alias at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\pwsh.exe` and a _preview/non-preview_-agnostic alias at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\WindowsApps\\Microsoft.PowerShellPreview_8wekyb3d8bbwe\\pwsh.exe`.",
