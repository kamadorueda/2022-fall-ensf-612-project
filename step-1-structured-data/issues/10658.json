All scripts what comes from PowerShell 5 or below and worked very well, are now don't work as expected. It will coast a lot of time to find the issue  because of PowerShell core.  There is a nice sentence: Never change a simple running system.\r\nIn my opinion, users questions will now increase because of the crazy behavior of PowerShell Core when it comes to encoding.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it should be considered, for the parameter -Encoding, to introduce a value such as OSdefault, like `-Encoding OSdefault`\r\n\r\nBut any ways, now that i know how complex i have to do it, because PowerShell Core are not willing to use the OS default settings any more, I have to use the new way.\r\n\r\n",

It doesn't come up with the argument completer, it's not listed in the help.  So people are no longer told about \"Default\" And if people want the default Ansi code page they can put `1252` or `$ExecutionContext.Host.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ANSICodePage`\r\n\r\n**But** there is undocumented support for \"default\", which seems specifically so that old scripts don't break. Either that should go,  or it should keep those old scripts working in the way they used to work. Silently changing \"default\" mean what most people would expect is wrong. \r\n\r\nIt's one place. In EncodingUtils.cs there is this\r\n```\r\ninternal static Dictionary<string, Encoding> encodingMap = new Dictionary<string, Encoding>(StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase)\r\n        {\r\n            { Ascii, System.Text.Encoding.ASCII },\r\n            { BigEndianUnicode, System.Text.Encoding.BigEndianUnicode },\r\n            { Default, ClrFacade.GetDefaultEncoding() },\r\n            { OEM, ClrFacade.GetOEMEncoding() },\r\n            { Unicode, System.Text.Encoding.Unicode },\r\n            { Utf7, System.Text.Encoding.UTF7 },\r\n            { Utf8, ClrFacade.GetDefaultEncoding() },\r\n            { Utf8Bom, System.Text.Encoding.UTF8 },\r\n            { Utf8NoBom, ClrFacade.GetDefaultEncoding() },\r\n            { Utf32, System.Text.Encoding.UTF32 },\r\n            { String, System.Text.Encoding.Unicode },\r\n            { Unknown, System.Text.Encoding.Unicode },\r\n        };\r\n     \r\n```\r\nEither delete the \"default\" entry and make people re-write to get the old behaviour or replace it with a suitable  `System.Text.Encoding.something`  which will give the old behaviour (without documenting it).  \r\n\r\n",

Looking at it again, it appears we did not implement `$PSDefaultEncoding` where there is a `WindowsLegacy` value that would resolve your issue, but only if you knew about it. The concept behind removing `Default` is that anyone relying on it would know immediately they were not getting the Windows PowerShell default encoding. The absence of specifying `-Encoding` would be UTF8NoBOM.\r\n\r\n@SteveL-MSFT \r\nthank you for your answer.\r\nNow after you remove the value `default,` will you also document (an example) how user can get back there funktionality as it was in WinPS? \r\nFor the parameter -Encoding, there is no value like `OSdefault` (like default was in WinPS). \r\nCan you may also discuss with the comittee, to implement a value like `OSdefault` with the value of default OS encoding ?\r\nWhat i mean is that as long as `OSdefault` is set as value for `-Encoding` it will use the OS default settings no matter if it is Unix or Windows. `OSdefault` force to read the OS default endocing and use it. That would be a very good and especially and easy usability and on top, the end user can easy see on the name of the value what it means.\r\n\r\nOr can you add a value for ANSI like `ANSI` and implement it with the code from @jhoneil\r\n`{ ANSI, System.Text.Encoding.GetEncoding(Host.CurrentCulture.TextInfo.ANSICodePage) },`\r\n\r\nThank you.",

Since WinPS there was a value \"UTF8\" for param \"-Encoding\" so it makes zero sence to change it with Core so that value \"default\" do exactly the same like \"UTF8\". \r\n\r\nAnd you would have reached the wider community if I had left the value \"Default\" on OS Encoding setting. Then you would reach even more in the community because it would be even more flexible as before and even more as it is now. Now there are 2 different values that the same do but no longer value to ANSI encoded. For all those who want to encode to ANSI it gets totally complicated starting with PS Core.\r\nThanks for opening PS Core to the broad community.\r\n\r\nSorry but you to a very big mistake on basic thinks! If this is how PS core gose to, than i have to tell all my customers to don't use PS Core because it is not longer a descendant of Powershell and not compatible to WinPS at all.\r\n\r\nThank you!",

This file was hand over to a 3. party application (this application needs the data in ANSI) which imports the data.\r\n\r\nSince I have run the exact same script with PS Core, half of the 45000 employee data sets the 3. party application imported were destroyed and the employee can't work in this application. Thats because of this big bug / issue in PS Core. \r\n\r\nOnce again, don't think only as a developer, think more as end user who use this application maybe since PS 3.0 (in this version the -Encoding default was implemented).\r\n\r\nIn my case, more than 20000 employee base data in the shift planing system was destroyed and my client was very angry. Till i found the issue i takes 1,5 days. In this 1,5 days this more than 20000 employees can't book ther times or request absences and stuff like this.\r\n\r\nFrom my point of view, there must not be such changes in PS Core and these changes contradict the official statements that PS Core is compatible with WinPS.\r\n\r\nMaybe for the developers of Powershell Core it is not a big deal, to change some simple thinks like this, but for the people who use Powershell Core it is a big change and let break the scripts who use stuff like this.\r\n\r\nAnd the more crazy thing for me is why it is so hard for the dev team of PS Core and Microsoft to understand this and why theye can not admit that it was a mistake to make that change and say ok, we'll undo that change.",

But, it appears that the person who put that line in did not understand that \"default\" here didn't mean what it usually means. Form @Skybeat 's point of view that misunderstanding means **New PowerShell = Corrupt Output.** \r\n\r\nDeleting that one line would force anyone using \"default\" to get their national code page to make a change, and changing it as I outlined in a previous post would all @Skybeat  's produced the expected out put. Either this was not clear to committee when it was discussed, or if was the benefit of silently corrupting output if a legacy choice is selected needs a little more explanation.\r\n",

Now I have asked my colleagues who uses the code \"Set-Content -Encoding default\" in their scripts. Everyone uses it.\r\nNow imagine the scriptre with such erroneous behavior, e.g. be used in banking or social work.\r\nCould you as a developer really not look over the counter and think of any effects before you start discussing something that is not worth discussing as it has been rooted in Powershell way too long?\r\nHave you ever considered discussing it with end users and listening to it before you know better about making such significant changes?\r\n\r\nSorry if I say so directly but it's a shame how you deal with the end users. You leave them alone with the problem and mistakes that you know and which have been reported to you.\r\nYou come with more and more excuses just to not have to admit a mistake and as always the users have to be this discharge and stand straight for it.
