The results were the same. This issue started appearing recently for me, maybe at the time the new Windows Terminal was released. Unfortunately, I can't give any time, as I wasn't using accented letters in terminal for some time. A few of my colleagues experience it too, while others don't. My Windows installs are English, with added Polish input and regional settings. For both languages, I use Polish (Programmers) layout.\r\n\r\n# Remarks\r\n\r\nFor some reason, accented o works fine (\u00f3)\r\n\r\nList of scenarios I tried, and if accents work or not:\r\n* [x] cmd.exe / conhost.exe (no PowerShell)\r\n* [ ] Launch cmd.exe / conhost.exe window, and inside of it, launch PowerShell / PowerShell Core, type\r\n* [ ] powershell.exe / pwsh.exe\r\n* [ ] Windows Terminal - PowerShell / PowerShell Core\r\n* [x] Launch PowerShell PowerShell Core window, launch cmd, type\r\n* [x] PowerShell ISE\r\n* [x] Visual Studio Code Integrated Terminal\r\n* [ ] Visual Studio Code native PowerShell / PowerShell Core\r\n* [x] Visual Studio 2019 v16.4.0-pre.1.0 Package Manager Console\r\n* [ ] Visual Studio 2019 Developer PowerShell v16.4.0-pre.1.0\r\n* [x] Launch Git Bash and from it, launch PowerShell / PowerShell Core, type\r\n* [x] PowerShell Core 6.2.3 in Azure Cloud Shell\r\n* [x] WSL Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (raw bash, both started as Ubuntu, and from Windows Terminal)\r\n* [x] WSL Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS -> pwsh (both started as Ubuntu, and from Windows Terminal)\r\nUsing -NoProfile has no effect, as well as using x86 version of PowerShell (Core)\r\n\r\nIf you type a text in another editor, and copy-paste it to PowerShell Core 6.2.3 window with either Ctrl+V or Shift+Insert, it works, but with right mouse click, it doesn't (all regular characters, and '\u00f3' are pasted, while the rest of accented characters are removed). In PowerShell 5.1, the right-click behavior is similar, while with Ctrl+V / Shift+Insert the accents are stripped (letters converted to Latin, except for '\u00f3'), and '\u20ac' is converted to '?'.\r\n\r\nThe list of special characters on Polish (Programmers) keyboard:\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\u0105\u0107\u0119\u0142\u0144\u00f3\u015b\u017a\u017c\u20ac\r\n```\r\n\r\nThey're obtained by either using AltGr (right Alt) combination, or typing ~ (Shift+\\`), and then the desired key with the following keys:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nacelnosxzu\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis may be related to Emoji support issue #10016 and this: https://github.com/microsoft/terminal/issues/3019",
