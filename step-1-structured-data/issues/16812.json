  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\n`Get-ItemPropertyValue` automatically expand `REG_EXPAND_SZ` value when fetching one from the windows registry.\r\nWith this behavior, the coder cannot read a value, modify it, and write it back to the registry. It is a problem since juste READING a value actually MODIFY the value.\r\n\r\nI would suggest to add an option to just read the value as-is. For example `-Raw` to get it simple. Or if you want a `-Options` with an object of type `RegistryValueOptions`.\r\n\r\nI would prefer a simple `-Raw` option (like in `Get-Content -Raw`) to be used like this :\r\n`Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path \"HKLM:\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Session Manager\\Environment\" -Name \"Path\" -Raw`\r\n\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nThis post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51776242/how-to-retrieve-original-unresolved-unexpanded-registry-value give a workaround : \r\n```\r\n(Get-Item -Path HKCU:\\Environment).GetValue(\r\n  'PATH',  # the registry-value name\r\n  $null,   # the default value to return if no such value exists.\r\n  'DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames' # the option that suppresses expansion\r\n)\r\n```\r\nBut it is far way more complicated and unintuitive in comparison of just `Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path HKCU:\\Environment -Name PATH -Raw` (I think).\r\n\r\nThank you",

To me it is counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\nThe logic at the beginning would have been to read raw value by default (because it is the real value, unexpanded) and either call `Get-ItemPropertyValue` with an optional `-Expand` parameter or pipe it to an expansion function. But I'm aware that it would probably break things if we change the default behavior now.\r\n\r\nAll that said, if the feature is implemented with a `-NoExpand` parameter, I'll welcome it with pleasure ;)",

So it is reasonable for `Get-ItemPropertyValue` have the same default, but not so reasonable to have no other option. \r\n\r\nThe `Get-ItemProperty` cmdlet creates a custom object with the selected Property/properties as members.  These are also expanded. \r\n\r\n```\r\nps> $p = Get-ItemProperty -Path  \"HKCU:\\Environment\" -Name \"Temp\"\r\nps> $p\r\n\r\nTEMP         : C:\\Users\\xxxx\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\r\nPSPath       : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment\r\nPSParentPath : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\r\nPSChildName  : Environment\r\nPSDrive      : HKCU\r\nPSProvider   : Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry\r\n\r\n\r\n> $p | gm\r\n\r\n   TypeName: System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject\r\n\r\nName         MemberType   Definition\r\n----         ----------   ----------\r\nEquals       Method       bool Equals(System.Object obj)\r\nGetHashCode  Method       int GetHashCode()\r\nGetType      Method       type GetType()\r\nToString     Method       string ToString()\r\nPSChildName  NoteProperty string PSChildName=Environment\r\nPSDrive      NoteProperty PSDriveInfo PSDrive=HKCU\r\nPSParentPath NoteProperty string PSParentPath=Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\r\nPSPath       NoteProperty string PSPath=Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Environment\r\nPSProvider   NoteProperty ProviderInfo PSProvider=Microsoft.PowerShell.Core\\Registry\r\nTEMP         NoteProperty string TEMP=C:\\Users\\xxxx\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf any changes are to be made, `Get-ItemProperty` and  `Get-ItemPropertyValue` should both support the same dynamic parameter. See below on names but  `-Raw`,  `-NoExpand`  or something else based on the values of the `RegistryValueOptions`  enum could all work. There are only two values for `RegistryValueOptions` btw, `None` and `DoNotExpandEnvironmentNames` \r\n\r\nWhether it _really_ is or not I always thought of  `Get-ItemPropertyValue  -Path X -Name Y` to be `(Get-ItemProperty -path X -name Y).Y`  under the surface and their behaviour should be the same.  This would mean that a call to  `Get-ItemProperty` which returns more than one ExpandString treats them ALL the same way, which is fine. \r\n\r\nOverall it looks like a good idea to me - which isn't to say it is practical, but it seems to break nothing and move things in the right direction. \r\n\r\n\r\n**Switch parameter Names**  Are best as `-DoSomethingNonDefault`  the _absence_ of the switch always conveys  \"do nothing  / do the default\" and where possible the name gives some idea what the default is. \r\nThis means we might have `New-Account -Disabled` - accounts are enabled by default.   `Set-` commands often follow their `New` or `Add-`  counterparts giving `Set-Account -disabled`.  People don't like `-disabled:$false` to say \"Undo changing from the default\".  That doesn't apply to \"Get X in the non-default way\" operations like this. \r\n \r\nThere are precedents for inverting the name to `NoDefaultBehaviour`  15 or so are used once and these used at least twice.\r\n   2 NoProxy              \r\n   2 NoEnumerate                \r\n   3 NoEncryption         \r\n   3 NoTypeInformation    \r\n   5 NoServiceRestart     \r\n   5 NoNewline            \r\n   6 NoClobber            \r\n\r\nOne _can_ use `command | out-file -NoClobber:$false ...`  but in practice people omit the parameter completely and they write `-NoClobber` in preference to `-NoClobber:$true`  (a boolean `-Clobber  $false` would be the worst of all).  \"\r\nIt's usually better to avoid  \"Yes, I don't want...\"   but  the double negative is seldom a problem. \r\n",

So any .NET based installer that adds an entry to path more than likely forces it to `REG_SZ`. This thread has more info dotnet/runtime#1442",

(a) Everything adds itself as the first item so the OS directories where most things are found are about the tenth thing to be searched (not new, DOS installers did that in the 1980s)   and (b) two uses 8.3. converted name C:\\PROGRA~1\\ etc. In 2022! \r\n\r\nSo yes if an installer can louse up the path, it probably will.
