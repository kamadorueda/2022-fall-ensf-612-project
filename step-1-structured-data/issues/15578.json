  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nPlease add a Set-LocalGroupMembers function that would set the group to have only the member specified.\r\n\r\nRight now you'd need to use Add-LocalGroupMember. Then Get-LocalGroupMember followed by Remove-LocalGroupMember to remove any that aren't in the list.\r\n\r\nAlthough Get-LocalGroupMember throws an error if you have Azure-AD elements\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",

It is not Open Source as it uses undocumented APIs and thus not something this project can extend.  Our recommendation is for the community to develop a cross-platform account management module covering all the appropriate capabilities.",
