  "body": "PR https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/12797 tried to implement support for _relative_ target paths for symbolic links (symlinks).\r\n\r\n* On Windows, this now works properly.\r\n\r\n* On Unix-like platforms, a relative input path is still unexpectedly converted to a full path and stored as such in the symlink.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nNote: Run on macOS and/or Linux (the test succeeds on Windows).\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPush-Location -ea Stop ($tmpDir = (New-Item -Type Directory -Force (Join-Path Temp:/ $PID)).FullName)\r\n\r\n# Create a file to serve as the symlink target.\r\n$null = New-Item -Force file\r\n\r\n# Determine the native file-system path separator, as well as the one \r\n# *not* native to the platform.\r\n$sep = [IO.Path]::DirectorySeparatorChar\r\n$otherSep = $sep -eq '/' ? '\\' : '/'\r\n\r\n# To also test path-separator normalization, we use the non-native separator.\r\n$null = New-Item -Force -Type SymbolicLink fileL -Target \".${otherSep}file\"\r\n\r\n# The symlink's target should be a relative path that uses the platform-appropriate path separator.\r\n(Get-Item fileL).Target | Should -Be \".${sep}file\"\r\n\r\n# Clean up.\r\nPop-Location; Remove-Item $tmpDir -Recurse\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe test should succeed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe test fails, because the relative input path is unexpectedly first resolved to a full path before the symlink is defined:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nInvalidResult: Expected strings to be the same, but they were different. \r\nExpected length: 6 Actual length:   14 Strings differ at index 0. \r\nExpected: './file' But was: '/tmp/2802/file'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.2.0-preview.4\r\n```\r\n",
