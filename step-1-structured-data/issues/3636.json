  "body": "## Expected Behavior\r\nWhen using PowerShell of any version, I should be able to review published online documentation for the version of PowerShell I am using in an easily discoverable location.\r\n\r\n## Current Behavior\r\nDocumentation exists online in properly published formats for PowerShell versions `5.1` and below.\r\nCurrently, the documentation for `6.x` lives only in the markdown documents of the repository and is not published outside of this.\r\n\r\n## Possible Solution\r\nPublish the documentation, but be clear that `6.x` is not released yet (as currently done in the docs inside the repo).\r\n\r\n## Context\r\nA naive user of PowerShell, particularly cross-platform PowerShell v6, may not necessarily know to go check the repository for documentation. Moreover, if the docs are not easily discoverable from a google search of \"PowerShell Docs version 6\" or similar, they may as well not exist for a segment of the user base.\r\n\r\nPublishing the documentation makes it easier for folks to dive into the documents and to provide feedback/actually use the documents in testing scenarios. Of course, avoiding a conflict with the documentation for released PowerShell versions is a concern, but being clear and up front about v6's state in the docs will help with this.",
