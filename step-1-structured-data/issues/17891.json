  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nCurrently building a package for powershell on Alpine Linux. When building for `aarch64`, `armv7` platform, build fails due to trying to crosscompile to those platforms. Cross-compilations should not occur on a platform that is building for itself, yet the build process tries to force that.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce, `git clone https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/ayakael/aports -b testing/powershell-arm` and `abuild -r` in any Alpine environment eqal or greater to version 3.16 when in `aports/testing/powershell` directory. \r\n\r\nAport for build process is accessible [here](https://gitlab.alpinelinux.org/ayakael/aports/-/blob/testing/powershell-arm/testing/powershell/APKBUILD)\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nBuild should not use CrossGen2 to build `powershell`\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nBuild tries to use CrossGen2 to build on the same platform.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\n/usr/lib/dotnet/sdk/6.0.108/Sdks/Microsoft.NET.Sdk/targets/Microsoft.NET.CrossGen.targets(463,5): error MSB6003: The specified task executable \"/home/buildozer/.nuget/packages/microsoft.netcore.app.crossgen2.linux-musl-arm64/6.0.8/tools/crossgen2\" could not be run.
