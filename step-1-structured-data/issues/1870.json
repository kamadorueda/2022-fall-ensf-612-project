However `LS` still operates in the original mode, which is weird.\n## Actual behavior\n\nWhen running `LS` from a PS Drive like ENV:, it seems that LS is executed outside of PowerShell's directory context. \n\nChecking here...\n![](http://i.imgur.com/pxinW3S.png)\n\nIt seems LS isn't mapped as an alias as it normally is within PowerShell.\n## Environment data\n\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\n\n``` powershell\n> $PSVersionTable\n\nName                           Value                                                                                                                                                      \n----                           -----                                                                                                                                                      \nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha                                                                                                                                      \nPSEdition                      Core                                                                                                                                                   \nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                                                                                                                    \nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\nCLRVersion                                                                                                                                                                 \nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                                                                                                                        \nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                                                                                                                        \nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                                                                                                                                    \n\n\n\n```\n",
