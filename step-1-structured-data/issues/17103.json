It's hard to see that as widely needed. And inserting at the top of a file consumes more resource than appending to the end, so the best way to do this is to log a transcript and when stop transcript is run append the pre-existing logs to the end of it. \r\n",

What happens if you are in the middle of an insertion and pwsh or the host crashes?\r\n\r\nI can not see the value in this.",
