  "body": "These were super opaque wrappers of the host command line  now bin powershell  that passed command line arguments of where to find things.  With the recent refactor of the build system and the host itself, all of these scripts were rendered totally unnecessary. A few environment variables still need to be set  read  key value pairs    env LD_LIBRARY_PATH=lib CORE_ROOT=src monad ext coreclr Runtime PWRSH_ROOT=lib PSMODULEPATH=lib Modules bin powershell lib powershell run.exe  It is much simpler now to understand how PowerShell itself is launched, from start to finish.
