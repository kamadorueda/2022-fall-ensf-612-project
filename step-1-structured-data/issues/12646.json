  "body": "`-Scope` should default to `LocalMachine`, which means that running `Set-ExecutionPolicy` from a non-elevated session should fail with an error message indicating the need to elevate.\r\n\r\nAs of PowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.2, an inapplicable success / error hybrid message is shown (a regression from 7.0).\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nOn Windows, from a non-elevated session:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Note: Pick a policy OTHER than the one in effect.\r\nSet-ExecutionPolicy Restricted\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe following error should be reported (which is true in 7.0):\r\n\r\n```none\r\nSet-ExecutionPolicy: Access to the path 'C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\powershell.config.json' is denied.\r\nTo change the execution policy for the default (LocalMachine) scope, \r\nstart PowerShell with the \"Run as administrator\" option. \r\nTo change the execution policy for the current user, run \"Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser\".\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe following error is emitted instead.\r\n\r\n```none\r\nSet-ExecutionPolicy: PowerShell updated your execution policy successfully, \r\nbut the setting is overridden by a policy defined at a more specific scope.  \r\nDue to the override, your shell will retain its current effective execution policy of RemoteSigned.\r\nType \"Get-ExecutionPolicy -List\" to view your execution policy settings. For more information please see \"Get-Help Set-ExecutionPolicy\".\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that not only is the error message inapplicable, it incorrectly suggests that an update was actually performed.\r\n\r\n(And, as an aside: Even when that error is reported as designed, it is problematic - see #12032.)\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPowerShell Core 7.1.0-preview.2\r\n```\r\n",
