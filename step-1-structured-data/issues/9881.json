  "body": "__EDIT: 2019-06-25 - Additional conditions and clarifications, corrected expected behavior as requiring the curly quotes to be doubled, added second example demonstrating the tab completion when the first character of the file name is not a quote character, added third example for curly double quotes__\r\n\r\nI am not sure what is really responsible for tab completion of path names in PowerShell, but here is what I found while testing a similar function in posh-git.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\n```powershell\r\necho hello >\"`u{2018}hello`u{2019}.txt\"\r\n\r\nget-content   # press tab until file `.\\\u2018hello\u2019.txt` is shown\r\n```\r\nExample 2\r\n```powershell\r\necho hello >\"hello`u{2019}.txt\"\r\n\r\nget-content   # press tab until file `'.\\hello\u2019.txt'` is shown\r\n```\r\nExample 3\r\n```powershell\r\necho hello >\"hello`u{201C}.txt\"\r\n\r\nget-content  \"hello\" # press tab until file `\".\\hello\u201c.txt\"` is shown\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\n```PowerShell\r\nget-content '.\\\u2018\u2018hello\u2019\u2019.txt'\r\n```\r\nExample 2\r\n```PowerShell\r\nget-content '.\\hello\u2019\u2019.txt'\r\n```\r\nExample 3\r\n```PowerShell\r\nget-content \".\\hello\u201c\u201c.txt\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nExample 1\r\n```PowerShell\r\nget-content .\\\u2018hello\u2019.txt\r\n```\r\nThis generates an error saying the file `hello.txt` cannot be found.  Note this particular behavior is regardless of the type of quote used, as long as the quote is a legal filename character and is at the start of the file name and is a special character for PowerShell.\r\n\r\nExample 2\r\n```PowerShell\r\nget-content '.\\hello\u2019.txt'\r\n```\r\nThis will cause PSReadLine to want to continue a multiline input because the quoted string is still open.\r\n\r\nExample 3\r\n```PowerShell\r\nget-content \".\\hello\u201c.txt\"\r\n```\r\nThis will cause PSReadLine to want to continue a multiline input because the quoted string is still open.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18912\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\nIn https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git/issues/683#issuecomment-501125585 @rkeithhill commented that it would be nice if PowerShell has a static method for escaping arguments, and it was that comment that triggered me to test this possibility.  I have not tried to test all characters that could be special but found in file names to see if any more are missing escaping.\r\n\r\nAnother issue with tab completion, server/share names with spaces, #7569, but this only affects the path while it is just '\\\\server\\share with a space'...\r\n",

It would appear that all argument type completers fail to correctly escape arguments with characters such as curly quotes (``` [`u{2018}-`u{201E}] ```), but also, because each completer seems to have its own escaping logic results can be inconsistent between different completions.\r\n\r\nAdditional points:\r\n\r\n- #7569 is an example where the file path argument completer completely fails to escape/quote paths when providing a list of UNC server share names.\r\n- I have since found that the variable name argument completer fails to escape/quote variable names that start with a `$` or `$$` but possess no other characters needing quoted.  The only variable in that category that doesn't need quoted is `$` itself (but must be prevented from being followed by either `(` or `{`).  (Technically, a $ only needs to be escaped (and thus quoted) if its followed by a valid variable character, a `{` or a `(`)\r\n- I believe I have determined, that on 'nix OS, the file path completer (when not LiteralPath) does not escape `*` and `?` characters (briefly referenced in #9244 by @mklement0) (though `[` and `]` are), probably because those are otherwise invalid file name characters on Windows, but they are escaped by other completers.  Notably, this causes a problem when a `variable:` drive is used with a CMDLET such as Get-Content, because this is completed through the file path argument completer and not the variable name argument completer.\r\n\r\nI am continuing to work through understanding the completers in depth.\r\n",
