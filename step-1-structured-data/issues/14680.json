This is not an easy setup. There are three or four places to set the colors which the person has to find themselves because nobody cares to elaborate enough for a mere mortal to understand and then you can start an issue that's not based on a template that is mentioned somewhere somewhere.\r\n\r\nThis may be an open source, but it sure does seem as a closed community.",
