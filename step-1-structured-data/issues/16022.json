You should not use the default constructor but one of the parameterized constructors that sets up the internal state.  PowerShell has to be started in 'server mode' in the new process instance.  Yours does not run in server mode and so cannot communicate over the remote channel, and you see the hang.  Also you should provide the default type table to ensure common types are re-hydrated over the connection.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> $typeTable = [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.TypeTable]::LoadDefaultTypeFiles()\r\n\r\nPS C:\\> [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PowerShellProcessInstance]::new\r\n\r\nOverloadDefinitions\r\n-------------------\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PowerShellProcessInstance new(version **powerShellVersion**, pscredential\r\ncredential, scriptblock initializationScript, bool useWow64, string workingDirectory)\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PowerShellProcessInstance new(version **powerShellVersion**, pscredential\r\ncredential, scriptblock initializationScript, bool useWow64)\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\> $typeTable = [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.TypeTable]::LoadDefaultTypeFiles()\r\nPS C:\\> $pi = [System.Management.Automation.Runspaces.PowerShellProcessInstance]::new(\"5.1\", $null, $null, $false)\r\nPS C:\\> $rs = [runspacefactory]::CreateOutOfProcessRunspace($typeTable, $pi)\r\nPS C:\\> $rs.Open()\r\nPS C:\\> $ps = [powershell]::Create($rs)\r\nPS C:\\> $ps.AddScript('$psversionTable').Invoke()\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nCLRVersion                     4.0.30319.42000\r\nPSVersion                      5.1.19041.1151\r\nBuildVersion                   10.0.19041.1151\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSEdition                      Desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
