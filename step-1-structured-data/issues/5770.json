      "body": "We are currently finishing a Rust cross-platform implementation of Authenticode for PE executables using [picky-rs](https://github.com/Devolutions/picky-rs) and lief-rs (https://github.com/Devolutions/lief-rs) and I was thinking I could have the developer working on it continue with a cross-platform PowerShell Authenticode implementation, which could help solve this problem once and for all. Unlike Authenticode for PE executables, we wouldn't need [LIEF](https://lief.quarkslab.com/) for PowerShell code signing, meaning we could have all of our code in pure Rust without a C++ dependency.\r\n\r\nOur primary goal is not directly aligned with this task, but it could be if there is a good fit. We intend to code sign scripts from a centralized server and have them executed by our agent program on Windows, macOS, and Linux only after we've validated the signature. This would be done using a PowerShell native host, outside of built-in code signing validation process. At least that's the plan for now, but I hope we could use this as the basis for getting it done cleanly inside the main PowerShell project after.\r\n\r\nOne of the issues that makes cross-platform Authenticode difficult is that each system has its own certificate store, and they don't necessarily contain the same Root CAs as those found on Windows. Since I intend to use a pinned trusted root CA for my validation, this shouldn't be an issue, but I'd still like to do the regular validation. I know Windows uses Certificate Trust Lists (CTLs) since Windows Vista, meaning it might be possible to simply fetch the same CTL dynamically from the Microsoft CDN URL and port Authenticode *trust* to other platforms this way.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have no idea if the Authenticode CAs are contained within this bundle or not, so I'd appreciate if someone could point me to more information about Authenticode CAs as opposed to WebPKI CAs on Windows. If it's contained within the same bundle, then I know how we can do it, we'd just need to implement a whole bunch of new ASN.1 structures to parse the CTL and its contents.\r\n\r\nI'm still gathering information on how to do this to help plan this task for the developer working on this, so feel free to send me as much resources as you have to unblock this.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/fa59b114511954ffa1452fc4d4ea889e23b8237e4e8c6b7daed49e809a56b353/Devolutions/lief-rs\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Devolutions/lief-rs\">Devolutions/lief-rs</a></strong></div><div>Rust bindings for LIEF (https://github.com/lief-project/LIEF) - Devolutions/lief-rs</div></blockquote>",

      "body": "@davespatzavantor I don't think anyone is currently actively working on this, but I have recently created a nuget package and PowerShell module derived from the original AuthenticodeSignature cmdlets + added support for zip file signatures (unrelated to the current feature request). It took me some time to take the code out of the main PowerShell code base, but it is now standalone, and therefore much easier to experiment with if someone wants to begin the work of porting it to non-Windows.\r\n\r\nHere's the repository: https://github.com/Devolutions/devolutions-authenticode\r\n\r\nYou will find a lot of notes in there on how to generate your own Authenticode CA and use it to sign files, it's a good reference for testing. I also have a ready-made test CA that can be imported for testing with the same CA over and over again.\r\n\r\nThe current code unfortunately relies heavily on the wintrust APIs, which deal with the vast majority of the authenticode signing operations: you feed it the file data + file name extension, and wintrust does it all for you. I would suggest referring to our working Rust Authenticode implementation from [picky-rs](https://github.com/Devolutions/picky-rs/tree/master/picky-signtool/src) to begin the work in .NET.\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://opengraph.githubassets.com/568871aa8c0399d28a68e2c8c148b690bfb212c0be1642abc05b3109f1f1d18f/Devolutions/devolutions-authenticode\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><img src=\"https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg\" height=\"14\"> GitHub</div><div><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/Devolutions/devolutions-authenticode\">GitHub - Devolutions/devolutions-authenticode: Devolutions Authenticode Signing</a></strong></div><div>Devolutions Authenticode Signing.
