  "body": "In working on #4948 I noticed that Identity, Compress, and Chunked tests were missing. I was able to add Deflate as it was low hanging fruit. \r\n\r\nChunked \"kind of\" gets tested with gzip as Kestrel returns the gzip data chunked. But a separate test for just chunked without gzip would be better. \r\n\r\nCompress might require a 3rd party API. Unless there is some LZW support hidden in .NET Core 2.0 that I missed. \r\n\r\nIdentity is low hanging fruit. ",
