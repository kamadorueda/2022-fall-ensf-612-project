  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nTravis CI fails (see [the build](https://travis-ci.org/PowerShell/PowerShell/jobs/350950800)) when verifying packaging after PR #6335 was merged, which added `--no-restore` to `dotnet publish` in `Start-PSBuild` to avoid a redundant restoring operation. The failure happens when running `Start-PSBuild -PSModuleRestore -Clean -Runtime linux-arm`, and the error suggests that a `dotnet restore` didn't run for `linux-arm` runtime.\r\n\r\nThe root cause is that we don't specify `--runtime` when running `dotnet restore` in `Start-PSBuild`, and hence `dotnet restore` uses the current runtime of the running environment, which will always be `linux-x64` on our travis-ci builder. The fix is to pass in the runtime.\r\n\r\nThis change also skips restoring for test `.csproj` files in `Start-PSBuild`, because they will be taken care of by `Publish-PSTestTools` and `Start-PSxUnit`.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
