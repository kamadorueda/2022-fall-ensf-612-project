[Pash](https://github.com/Pash-Project/Pash) made use of the document some, but I believe they found it rather incomplete.\n\nNow that the official implementation is open source, I'm guessing the biggest value of the language specification is as an aid to learning the language.  Do people agree with this?\n\nI also wonder if the community would be willing to help update it.\n",

We need a document with its description.\r\nAlso, we need to define the _format_ of the document. Will this .md file, wiki or something else? Maybe PG will do the document workpiece in the correct place to start the process?",
