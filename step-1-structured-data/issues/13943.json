  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nSometime after 7.0, a new ETS script property named `CommandLine` was introduced for `System.Diagnostics.Process` instances, so that you could query a given process' command line; e.g.:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Currently Windows and Linux only): get the PowerShell session's own command line.\r\n(Get-Process -Id $PID).CommandLine\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, currently this is limited to Windows and Linux  (and the behavior on Linux is problematic - see #13944).\r\n\r\nExtending the solution to macOS is not only desirable, but easy to do; see below.\r\n\r\n**Note**:  What `ps -o command=` returns doesn't preserve the original argument boundaries, because the _verbatim_ arguments (as actually received by the process, given that there are no per-process command lines on Unix) are simply space-concatenated.\r\n\r\nA more robust solution would require substantially more effort, and has inherent conceptual challenges - see  the discussion about the Linux solution in #13944.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nExtend https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/72608fb829881727f7d9b6295fb133613a30b6fe/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/TypeTable_Types_Ps1Xml.cs#L1145-L1153\r\n\r\nto (but also see #13944 for an additional potential change required for _Linux_):\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n                new PSScriptProperty(\r\n                    @\"CommandLine\",\r\n                    GetScriptBlock(@\"\r\n                        if ($IsWindows) {\r\n                            (Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter \"\"ProcessId = $($this.Id)\"\").CommandLine\r\n                        } elseif ($IsLinux) {\r\n                            Get-Content -LiteralPath \"\"/proc/$($this.Id)/cmdline\"\"\r\n                        } elseif ($IsMacOS) {\r\n                            ps -o command= $this.Id\r\n                        }\r\n                    \"),\r\n```\r\n",
