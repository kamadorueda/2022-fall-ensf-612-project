  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n1. Introduce searching for help content by keyword as a step before searching full content.\r\n2. Index help keywords to make the search faster.\r\n3.  Specify relevant keywords for help articles, including `EXIT` for `about_Language_Keywords`.\r\n4. Add the parameter `-Force` to `Get-Help`; specifying this parameter would make `Get-Help` perform full text search.\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n```powershell\r\nHELP EXIT -CA:HelpFile | MEASURE | % COUNT |  SHOULD -BE 1\r\n```\r\nExpected 1, but got 34.  32 of those are completely irrelevant to the query, 1 is tangential.",
