  "body": "$var.GetType() can raise an exception in tests so we should check $var\r\nbefore make the call. A large part of the tests does not make this\r\ncheck.\r\nI start with searching \".GetType()\" but discovered many related issues\r\nin tests (reduntant and unneeded tests, \"throw\" bad pattens, bugs,\r\nformattings (sorry!) and so on) - I had to fix them too.\r\n\r\nAccording to our test roadmap, we must increase the code coverage from 45 up to 90% i.e. twice. Bad patterns and bad formatting will slow down our movement. I hope the team will support me in this PR.",
