  "body": "I am on Windows 10, and I have installed Powershell Core 7, and run Update-Help as administrator. However, when I execute the command `get-help about_AutomaticVariables` (for example) I get an error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>get-help about_automaticvariables\r\nGet-Help: Get-Help could not find about_automaticvariables in a help file in this session.
