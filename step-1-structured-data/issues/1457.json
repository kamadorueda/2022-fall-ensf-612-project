  "body": "**What is the issue?**\n$PSVersionTable.PSEdition currently supports Desktop and Core enums. Because PowerShell is going to be Open and also available on Linux/Mac from August, we decided to rename these values so as to make it clear to the end user.\nWe decided to use the names WindowsPowerShell,PowerShellCore.\n\n**How was the issue/bug found?**\nInternal brainstorming w.r.t PowerShell efforts.\n\n**What is the user/product impact?**\nLong term using the words like \"Desktop\" confuses customers. We would like customers to be aware of 2 kinds of PowerShell -WindowsPowerShell and PowerShellCore. The word \"Desktop\" does not align with our long term direction.\n",

In GA release it will be \"PowerShellCore\".\n",
