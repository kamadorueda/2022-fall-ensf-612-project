      "body": "Question: Is the patch optional or does this mean that the support for 6.0.0 gets dropped? The modern lifecycle doc [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/PowerShell-Core-Support?view=powershell-6) does not talk about patch policy. This question came up because we were thinking whether PSSA is going to be limited to the latest .net core SDK that 6.0.1 has (and will therefore might get incompatible with 6.0.0), assuming that 6.0.0 gets deprecated (hence this question)\r\nThis boils down to the question: Can\\should a cmdlet built with a newer runtime (minor version or patch) compared to the one used by pwsh be expected to work?",
