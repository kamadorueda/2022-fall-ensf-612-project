  "body": "Note: \r\n  * `Get-Item` appears not to be affected, only `Get-ChildItem`\r\n  * Problem exists on all supported platforms.\r\n\r\nWildcard patterns support `` ` `` as the escape character to represent literal `` ` `` instances in the filename and to escape the following metacharacters: `* ? [ ]`\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# Create a file that contains a literal backtick and a literal substring that would be a valid\r\n# sub-pattern if interpreted as a wildcard expression.\r\nNew-Item -Type File 'a`[b]'\r\n\r\n# Match the newly created file using a wildcard expression with suitable escaping.\r\n# The following 2 command should be equivalent, but currently aren't.\r\nGet-ChildItem * -Include 'a```[b`]'\r\nGet-ChildItem -Path 'a```[b`]'\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nBoth `Get-ChildItem` commands should match the newly created file and output information about it.\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThe 2nd command unexpectedly fails:\r\n```\r\nGet-ChildItem : Cannot find path '/Users/jdoe/a```[b`]' because it does not exist.\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, note that `Get-Item` does _not_ exhibit this problem.\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-alpha (v6.0.0-alpha.18) on macOS 10.12.4\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-alpha (v6.0.0-alpha.18) on Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS\r\nPowerShell Core v6.0.0-alpha (v6.0.0-alpha.18) on Microsoft Windows 10 Pro (64-bit; v10.0.14393)\r\n```\r\n",
