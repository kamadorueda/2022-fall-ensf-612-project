Pester is [one such example](https://github.com/pester/Pester/blob/0f5aff9fc34323659f9d68c29b3265a7f0d6bf6a/Pester.psm1#L378).  It's not clear to me how the above statement applies in the context of such a module.\r\n\r\nConsider the following files:\r\n\r\n#### UsingTest.psm1\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n@(\r\n    'fileA.ps1'\r\n    'fileB.ps1'\r\n) |\r\n    % { . \"$(Split-Path -Path $MyInvocation.MyCommand.Path)\\$_\" }\r\n\r\nfunction Get1 { [int][MyEnum]::One }\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### fileA.ps1\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nusing namespace UsingTest.A\r\n\r\nAdd-Type @'\r\nnamespace UsingTest { namespace A {\r\n    public enum MyEnum {\r\n        One = 1,\r\n        Two\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n}\r\n'@\r\n\r\nfunction GetA1 { return [int][MyEnum]::One }\r\n\r\n$script:v1 = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### fileB.ps1\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\nusing namespace UsingTest.B\r\n\r\nAdd-Type @'\r\nnamespace UsingTest { namespace B {\r\n    public enum MyEnum {\r\n        One = 101,\r\n        Two\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n}\r\n'@\r\n\r\nfunction GetB1 { [int][MyEnum]::One }\r\n\r\nfunction GetV1 { $script:v1 }\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Is this a supported use of `using`?\r\n2. Is it certain that `GetA1` and `GetB1` will return `1` and `101`, respectively?\r\n3. How does the statement that \"the `using` statement needs to be the first statement in the script\" apply to such a module?\r\n4. Is there some other way large modules should be structured?\r\n\r\n------\r\nEdit: Add `$script:v1` statements.",

I have not successfully reproduced type resolution behavior consistent with inheritance when dot-sourcing `.ps1` files from a `.psm1` file.  On the contrary, consider that `Get1` succeeds and outputs `101`.  This suggests that `using namespace UsingTest.B` from the \"child\" `fileB.ps1` file is in effect in the \"parent\" `.psm1` file.\r\n\r\n>3. Not sure what you mean, that what you quoted is still true in the examples you gave. It needs to be the first statement in a script file, not an entire session\r\n\r\nMy apprehension stems from the definition of \"script\".  In particular, what does \"script\" mean in the context of a module.  \"script scope\", for example, as applied to variables seems to mean \"the scope of the entire module\".  `GetV1` outputs `1` despite that the only place `$v1` is set is in a different file that is not a parent.  If \"script\" really meant \"script file\" in the context of dot-sourcing `.ps1` files from a `.psm1`, `GetV1` should output null.",

Type resolution state is stored at the scope level, but it doesn't follow the same rules as other session state items like commands or variables. What I meant is if you declare a using statement in the `psm1`, it will be in effect in all child scopes.  For example\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# myModule.psm1\r\nusing namespace System.Management.Automation.Language\r\n\r\n& ./myOtherScript.ps1\r\n```\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n# myOtherScript.ps1\r\n[Ast]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn that example `[Ast]` would resolve to `System.Management.Automation.Language.Ast`.\r\n\r\n> My apprehension stems from the definition of \"script\". In particular, what does \"script\" mean in the context of a module.\r\n\r\nThat's fair, to be more specific it has to be the first statement in a \"thing\" that is parsed.  Typically this means per file, or input from the command prompt, or a dynamically created script block like `[scriptblock]::Create('using namespace x')`. \r\n\r\n",

The file specified in `RootModule`, on the other hand, is associated with the module SessionState.  `RootModule` is scalar, so it seems that modules composed from multiple .ps1 files must consolidate those from the file that is specified in `RootModule` (ie. by dot-sourcing).\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I haven't come across a viable alternative to this dot-sourcing approach for modules with many files.

It was originally meant to be fully static - as in - only affecting the `ps1` file that contains the statement, but the dynamic nature of PowerShell forced tracking the using state at runtime, and that naturally happens in a scope.\r\n\r\nSo mixing `using namespace` and dot sourcing is unfortunately fragile and I don't recommend it, but I believe you could dot source 1 file with all your `using namespace` statements and then not use `using namespace` in any other file in your module - that would behave how you'd like, other than getting good intellisense.",
