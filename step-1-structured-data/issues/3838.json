  "body": "Fixes #1779 \r\n\r\nIt would be awesome if someone who actually has a Mac (like @JamesWTruher or @BrucePay) can validate these instructions before we merge them.\r\n\r\nAlso, it would be great to know how accurate [these directions](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/compare/master...joeyaiello:HomebrewDocs?expand=1#diff-cb58069b7222dfcd5130fd97bf93e6e1R397) currently are. The reference to .NET Core 1.0.0 makes me think it might be a little outdated. ",
