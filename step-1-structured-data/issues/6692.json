  "body": "Ubuntu 18.04 has moved to using libcurl4 instead of libcurl3. Even if both verison of the curl bianries and libraries are comaptible, there is a packaging issue that disallows packages using libcurl3 such as powershell to coexist with others that need libcurl4 such as cmake. Please relase powershell for Ubuntu 18.04 a.k.a bionic or people will be getting nasty surpirises next week just liek I did whe I upgraded early.",

Download the libicu57 dependancy:\r\n```\r\ncd /tmp\r\nwget http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/i/icu/libicu57_57.1-6ubuntu0.3_amd64.deb\r\n```\r\n2. Download the Debian package powershell_6.0.1-1.ubuntu.17.04_amd64.deb from the releases page onto the Ubuntu machine.\r\n```\r\nwget https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.0.1/powershell_6.0.1-1.ubuntu.17.04_amd64.deb\r\n```\r\n3. Extract the PowerShell package and change the dependencies to libcurl4\r\n```\r\ndpkg-deb -R powershell_6.0.1-1.ubuntu.17.04_amd64.deb pwsh-patched\r\nsudo apt install -y rpl\r\nrpl libcurl3 libcurl4 pwsh-patched/DEBIAN/control\r\n```\r\n4. Re-Package the p package\r\n```\r\ndpkg-deb -b pwsh-patched pwsh-patched.deb\r\n```\r\n5. Install both packages in this order:\r\n```\r\nsudo apt install -fy ./libicu57_57.1-6ubuntu0.3_amd64.deb ./pwsh-patched.deb\r\n```\r\nKudos to [Tim De Pauw](https://launchpad.net/~timdepauw) for [figuring out this exact libcurl3 dependency problem for another package](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl/+bug/1754294/comments/25), and @borgdylan for [suggesting this same fix for dotnet](https://github.com/dotnet/core-setup/issues/3875#issuecomment-383187576).
