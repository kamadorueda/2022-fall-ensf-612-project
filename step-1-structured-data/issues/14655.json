If not a bug, it is at least inconsistent in regard to other `$ErrorView` modes, which also color the console output, but do not emit ANSI escape codes when redirected to a file.\r\n\r\nNote that `Out-File` exhibits the same behaviour as the redirection operators `>` and `>>` in this regard:\r\n\r\n    $ErrorView = 'ConciseView'\r\n    Write-Error \"This is a test\" 2>&1 | Out-File test.txt\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n    \u001b[91mWrite-Error: \u001b[91mThis is a test\u001b[0m\r\n",

      "body": "/cc @SteveL-MSFT\r\nThe [`$PSStyle` work](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/13758) provides a workaround for the \"PowerShell error stream redirection\" scenraio, which requires you to set `$PSStyle.OutputRendering = \"Host\"`. The default `$PSStyle.OutputRendering` value is `Automatic`, which keeps the current behavior that people here observed. The `$PSStyle` work is available in PowerShell v7.2.0-preview.2.\r\n\r\nBut setting `$PSStyle.OutputRendering` won't chanage the behavior of `Write-Error \"This is a test\" 2>&1 | Out-File test.txt`, I believe, because the trick was done in the redirection code.",
