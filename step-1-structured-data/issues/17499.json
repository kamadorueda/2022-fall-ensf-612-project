If I remove any of the three headers it fails. \r\n\r\n(Top tip for this - in edge if you run the [f12] dev tools, go to network monitor and load the page, you can click do copy as PowerShell - which is what I did). When I tested the whole thing it worked so I cut it down more and more until it no longer worked). \r\n\r\nThere were quite a lot of changes in this area AIUI so quite possible that default browser headers were sent but aren't sent any more - without doing a packet trace I can't see \r\n",
