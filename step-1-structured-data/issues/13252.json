      "body": "From memory, this can happen if you accidentally load the Windows PowerShell help in some fashion, but there may be other cases it occurs too.\r\n\r\nIMO the default behaviour here should be improved; currently it's impossible to target either file even directly by exact name from Get-Help. Should probably do one of:\r\n\r\n- Pick the most recent version (if version information is available) of the two and display that, possibly with a warning stating there is another topic by that name.\r\n- Ask the user to select one via a prompt (though this is of dubious value as they have identical names and the user would probably pick at random), we'd need to show more information about it than we typically do, perhaps any available version information + the LastWriteTime of the actual xml file.\r\n- Pick whichever one it finds first and display that.\r\n\r\nRegardless of what the default is, we need a way to target the individual items from Get-Help itself; there currently isn't a way that I'm aware of?",
