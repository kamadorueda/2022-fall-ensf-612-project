All the investment in learning PowerShell is not lost and the difference between the old and new one are minimal. \r\n\r\nReporting the issue in their repo help speed up the process to get this done, and the best... you get a quick interaction with both the team and the community to help with the issue.\r\n\r\nHang in there!
