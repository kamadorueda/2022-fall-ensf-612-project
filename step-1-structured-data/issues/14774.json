  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAs a user I want to acquire \"Category\" and \"Module\" information while I precisely ask \"Get-Help\" command for documentation so that I can easily find where the command belongs to.\r\n\r\nFor example, if I want to get help of the command \"Write-Prompt\" and run `Get-Help Write-Prompt` (even with parameter `-Full`) I only know its NAME, SYNOPSIS, SYNTAX, DESCRIPTION... If I want to know its \"Category\" or \"Module\", I have to do weird things like running `Get-Help Write-P` (I have not found any other simple ways to do that).\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n`Get-Help` command could list the command's \"Category\" and \"Module\" (it's not lengthy, if so, they could be put in `-Full` or `-Detailed` output).\r\n",
