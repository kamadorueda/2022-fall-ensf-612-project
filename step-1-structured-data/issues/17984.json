      "body": "Likely not a bug per se, just was never implemented. Sounds like a good issue for new implementers, simply iterate through all rows once to get max column widths, then iterate second time to actually print with appropriate padding and alignment. \r\n\r\nCouple opens:\r\n1. How should we handle tables wider than terminal? Truncate, wrap, wrap within cell? User configurable? \r\n2. Do we really want to use box drawing characters, or  should we stick to more reliable set of `|+-`? Maybe allow user to provide character set for it to be most portable?\r\n\r\nMore general issue to be handled separately, but may as well put it here to keep it in mind: I was playing with `Show-Markdown` and am not really satisfied with the colors it uses for things like headers, we should add a style configuration using ANSI escapes, either as a parameter or inside `$PSStyle`.",
