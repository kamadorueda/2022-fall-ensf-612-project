      "body": "This is a carry-over from Windows PowerShell's documentation where `Byte` is a valid argument, but it looks like in PowerShell Core, it expects an `Encoding` *object* instead.  I was able to re-produce this in `6.*`, but not `5.1`.  I think it might be a defect for the `Get-Content` cmdlet rather than a wrong help doc.",
