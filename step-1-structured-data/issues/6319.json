  "body": "It is very difficult to provide users with instructions if the framework that we use changes its path everytime an update is released. Using powershell programs usually involves instructing users to create a shortcut like:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\npwsh.exe -Command C:\\path\\to\\script.ps1\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nBut this is implicit and only works if PS6 is the first pwsh in PATH. Or we could use full path:\r\n\r\n~~~\r\nC:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\6.0.1\\pwsh.exe -Command C:\\path\\to\\script.ps1\r\n~~~\r\n\r\nwhich works, until the user installs the 6.0.2 update. It is unreasonable to update all shortcuts because of this. Besides, there's really no point in having the exact version in the install path. This information does not belong there. The major version kinda makes sense, but major.minor.micro? And I gotta explain this all everytime to the users. It's pointless.\r\n\r\nThe only other software that does this is Java, which\r\n\r\n- is also a PITA exactly because of this\r\n- at least sets the JAVA_HOME envvar so that we can detect this\r\n\r\nWith PowerShell there's not too many ways to detect the installed version, especially in a way that works for a shortcut.\r\n\r\nPlease, consider using `%PROGRAMFILES%\\PowerShell` or at least `%PROGRAMFILES%\\PowerShell\\major` instead of `%PROGRAMFILES%\\PowerShell\\major.minor.micro`.",
