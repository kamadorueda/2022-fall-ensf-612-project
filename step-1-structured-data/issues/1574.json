The type used [FieldOffset](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.fieldoffsetattribute%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) incorrectly and caused problems when loading **this internal type**.\n\nAs far as auto-completion concerns, this should not result in the fatal inability to complete types.\n\ncc @BrucePay @lzybkr @LeeHolmes \n",
