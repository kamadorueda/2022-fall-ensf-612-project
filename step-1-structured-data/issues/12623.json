Error: \"The value could not be parsed.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe behaviour in terms of casting to bool is standard for structs, which always cast to `$true`. In the case of `BigInteger`, however, it is simply a slightly more complicated basic value type in function, so it's more appropriate to cast it to `$false` is the value is `0`.\r\n\r\nHowever, casting from an otherwise parseable string should always work for BigInteger; the engine recognises `1n` as a biginteger literal -- there's no reason it should fail to see it when casting from a string value as other suffixes work just fine.\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0-preview.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0-preview.2\r\nOS                             Darwin 19.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 19.3.0: Thu Jan  9 20:58:23 PST 2020; root:xnu-6153.81.5~1/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
