  "body": "Add back the `#if CORECLR` that was removed when moving powershell to `netcoreapp2.0`.\r\nThe schema validation fails in powershell core because:\r\n1. The XML Schema file `cmdlets-over-objects.xsd` is missing in Github\r\n2. The resource string `CmdletizationCoreResources.Xml_cmdletsOverObjectsXsd` likely needs to be reworked to make the schema validation work.\r\n\r\nThe failure causes powershell core to fail to load CDXML modules that worked before moving to `netcoreapp2.0`.\r\n\r\nNote that powershell core doesn't validate XML schemas due to the missing of related APIs in .NET Core 1.1 and prior versions. The `#if CORECLR` here was removed when moving to `netcore2.0` without verifying if the schema validation functionality actually works, so it should be reverted.",

But people might already pull that commit and start to work on top of it, and they would need to rebase their work if I `push --force-with-lease`.\r\nGiven that, I would rather not mess with the commit history in the master branch.",
