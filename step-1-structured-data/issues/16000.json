  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe recent change to Move-Item (PR https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/15077) is causing regressions on Windows platforms as reported by WSD.\r\n\r\nThe recent change of catching all IOException and retry is causing infinite recursion in some move cases.\r\n\r\nI suggest we consider moving back to the original code that tries to detect (Windows platform code path) when MoveTo or CopyAndDelete should be used, and add additional error handling to that, if needed.\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\ncd c:\\\r\nmkdir 0\r\nMove-Item  0 0\r\nMove-Item : The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.\r\n# Expected error is returned.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\ncd c:\\\r\nmkdir 0\r\nMove-Item 0 0\r\nCtrl+C\r\n# Move-Item runs recursion indefinitely, continually creating '0' subdirectories.\r\n\r\nMove-Item 0 0\\1\r\nCtrl+C\r\n# Move-Item runs recursion indefinitely, continually creating '1' subdirectories.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n```console\r\nUnexpected error\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0-preview.9\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0-preview.9-14-g403767d7f7b910a6f315505287fe9a72c3960c52\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19043\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n_No response_",

I think we have a time to do right fix.\r\n\r\nI still think it is not right to rely on driver positive return codes and it is better to cut off wrong scenarios like this as edge case.\r\n\r\nFor the issue HResult is 0x80070020 or -2147024864 on Windows. If we find the code for Unix we can exclude fallback to CopyAndDelete.\r\nAlso we can add simple check to CopyAndDelete if root paths for source and destination is the same.",
