  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThe screenshot below is using my `$prompt` function and supporting functions from https://github.com/heaths/profile. The following function should approximate this, though:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nfunction global:prompt {\r\n  \"`e[0;38;5;15;48;5;5mPS`e[38;5;5;48;5;8m`u{e0b0} `e[38;5;15m$PWD `e[0;38;5;8m`u{e0b0}`e[0m \"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Set the global prompt function as above.\r\n2. pushd into deep directories like so:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\npushd $env:TEMP\r\nmkdir (new-guid) | pushd\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, this approximate function had sporadic results compared with the screenshot below. Sometimes the expected behavior is what I saw, while others it was the actual behavior; however, when I got the expected behavior, resizing the window caused other problems as shown directly below:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1532486/70224521-400a1f00-1702-11ea-9e7e-8d346e49a812.png)\r\n\r\nNotice how the beginning of the prompts shifts by increasingly deeper margins.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe line background color stops at the end of the text where it should (see cmd.exe example in screenshot below, which uses a similar vterm sequence as my `$prompt`).\r\n\r\nThis problem also does not occur in the integrated terminal for VSCode:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1532486/70222551-126fa680-16ff-11ea-97e8-d1deb46caff1.png)\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe line background color extends to the window width. If I resize the window - e.g. shrink by 1 character width then move back to original width - this extra background line is cleared showing what I would otherwise expect (like in the cmd.exe you see in the following screenshot):\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1532486/70221580-7abd8880-16fd-11ea-9a5d-52766e39616c.png)\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362 \r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u0393\u00c7\u00aa}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\nFont: Cascadia Code PL",
