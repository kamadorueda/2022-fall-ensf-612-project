  "body": "A fast path is added to `WildcardPattern.IsMatch` for patterns like `test*`. However, this shows no noticeable improvements to `dir -Recurse C:\\Windows\\System32\\p*`.\r\nQuoted from @iSazonov's comment https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/pull/10054#issuecomment-509893349\r\n> When we send a path like `C:\\Windows\\System32\\p*` to engine our globbing code does all work - parse and expand `p*` to a collection with leaves. Then the already filtered leaves (in the example, all started with \"p\") is passed to a code which again filters the leaves by WindcardPattern.IsMatch(). So (1) we don't filter large, all full path list, only small collection of leaves  - that's why we get so little acceleration, (2) we do duplicated work that we would address, I believe it is common problem in globbing code - there is many places where it happens.\r\n\r\nSo it's possible our globing code is doing duplicate filtering, and it would be an optimization opportunity.",
