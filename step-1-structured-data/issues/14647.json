  "body": "By default `Get-Content` (and `switch -File`) streams lines on either CR, CRLF, _or_ LF newlines, which is a good thing as it allows to interchange (large) text files between Operating Systems. The point is though that in some cases a more specific line terminator is required (e.g. _only_ a `CRLF`) which could possible lead to not being able to stream lines (using standard cmdlets to prevent out of memory exceptions) if it concerns very large text files.\r\nSee: StackOverflow [Powershell - Count number of carriage returns line feed in .txt file](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65814922/1701026)\r\n\r\nAn additional Parameter as `-Newline <string>` (e.g. ``-Newline \"`r`n\"``) could resolve this and might also allow to stream a (large) text file on a completely different character (combination) as e.g. a tab: ``-Newline \"`t\"``.\r\n\r\n**Related**\r\n\r\n- [Powershell Count lines extremely large file](https://stackoverflow.com/q/54893310/1701026)\r\n- #14638 [`Out-String -Stream` unexpectedly does not split multi-line input strings into individual lines too](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/14638)",

      "body": "Note that `Get-Content` already has a `-Delimiter` parameter that serves this purpose: it accepts any literal string as the string to split the file content by, using _terminator_ logic rather than _separator_ logic (that is, if the content ends in the given string, _no_ additional, empty element is reported).\r\n\r\n`-Delimiter` is  a dynamic parameter of the `FileSystem` provider.\r\n\r\n",
