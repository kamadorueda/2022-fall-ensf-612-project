  "body": "These do not really belong in the `Linux.Host` project. The `ps1xml` files and some modules belong to `System.Management.Automation`, and some other modules belong to their respective module projects.\n\nThe current state of affairs is unfortunate for the FullCLR PowerShell builds, as its top project is _not_ `Linux.Host`, which has the required content. Some of the content dependencies are shared, but we cannot move them to their correct homes until dotnet/cli#753 is resolved.\n",
