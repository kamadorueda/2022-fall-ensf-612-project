Basically I'd like to see these as parse time concepts.\r\n\r\nFor constants, the compiler would actually treat them as a constant value rather than a variable lookup.

That solves the shadowing problem, and gives immediate feedback in the editor when accidently shadowing in the same lexical scope.\r\n\r\nWould these changes be breaking? Yeah.

The bigger, fundamental problem, I think, is PowerShell's dynamic scoping and shadow-on-assignment logic - but changing that would be the mother of all breaking changes.\r\n\r\nA potential middle ground that requires much less effort is to make the attribute turn on _both_ `AllScope` and `ReadOnly` / `Constant` - which is supported, ~~but not directly via the syntax of `New-Variable` and `Set-Variable`, because the flag nature of the `ScopedItemOptions` enum isn't supported due to only supporting a _scalar_ `-Option` argument~~ [_turns out it still works with multiple values_].\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nNew-Variable foo bar -Option AllScope, ReadOnly\r\n\r\n& { $foo = 'baz' } # FAILS even in CHILD SCOPE, as intended: \"WriteError: Cannot overwrite variable foo because it is read-only or constant.\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would solve the shadowing problem.\r\n\r\nWould PSES be able to pick up on this?\r\n\r\nGoing back to the syntax and potential implementation, and reviving @p0W3RH311's idea of using _types_ rather than _attributes_, which do strike me as syntactically preferable:\r\n\r\n`[PSReadOnly]` and `[PSConstant]` could then be new type accelerators that refer to two new classes that could derive from [`System.Management.Automation.PSVariable`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/api/System.Management.Automation.PSVariable), `System.Management.Automation.PSReadOnlyVariable`  and `System.Management.Automation.PSConstantVariable`  (somewhat paradoxically), which could encapsulate the `ReadOnly | AllScope` and `Constant | AllScope` construction respectively, which would give us:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n[PSReadOnly] $foo = 'bar'\r\n& { $foo = 'baz' } # FAILS\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
