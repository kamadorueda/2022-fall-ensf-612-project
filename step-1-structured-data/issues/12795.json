  "body": "Enterprise environment, have a central file server with home drives for each employee (~4,000).  Each employee has a path like `\\\\SERVER.DOMAIN.COM\\share\\home\\EMPLOYEEID`, and also has it mapped to `H:\\`.\r\n\r\nIn Powershell 7.01, cmdlets like `Get-Item` and `Get-ChildItem` take far longer to run against the UNC path than the corresponding mapped drive path.  Powershell 6.x and 5.1 do not exhibit this.\r\n\r\nTools like Wireshark and Process Monitor suggest that pwsh is traversing the path, getting a full directory list at each level.  For example, if I run `Get-Item \\\\SERVER.DOMAIN.COM\\share\\home\\MYID\\folder`, I will see in Wireshark all employee ID folder names in packet data as it enumerates at the `\\\\SERVER.DOMAIN.COM\\share\\home` level.\r\n\r\n# Steps to reproduce\r\n```powershell\r\nGet-Item \\\\SERVER.DOMAIN.COM\\share\\home\\MYID\\folder  #Slow\r\nGet-Item H:\\folder  #Fast\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n#Only perform the necessary SMB request.  Do not enumerate parent folders\r\nGet-Item \\\\SERVER.DOMAIN.COM\\share\\home\\MYID\\folder\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.1\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.1\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\nAlso have PS6 and PS5 installed.\r\n```",
