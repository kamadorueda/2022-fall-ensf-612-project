      "body": "The issue here is the BITS module is run in an implicit remoting session because it doesn\u2019t advertise that it can run in PowerShell. Implicit remoting starts a Windows PowerShell process and created proxy commands for the modules commands which just transfer the input and parameter to the remote session and outputs the data back to the local one. Unfortunately this boundary involves serialisation which converts the live objects to a dead deserialised object. It\u2019s these deserialise objects that can no longer be pipelined like the BITS commands are expecting.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things you can do\r\n\r\n* Run the whole statement with your pipelines in 1 script in the remote PSSession\r\n* try and import the BITS module with `-SkipEditionCheck` so it\u2019s loaded in PowerShell\r\n* Petition the BITS team to make their modules compliant with PowerShell",

      "body": "@AX502 You can also try the experimental feature `PSImplicitRemotingBatching`. This feature examines the command typed in the shell, and if all the commands are implicit remoting proxy commands that form a simple pipeline, then the commands are batched together and invoked as a single remote pipeline. [See the details and an example here.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/experimental-features?view=powershell-7.1#psimplicitremotingbatching).",
