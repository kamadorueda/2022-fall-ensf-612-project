  "body": "Currently our PowerShell build module has become a _hard_ dependency to build PowerShell, as it generates the C# bindings from resource files (replacing `resgen`). This makes bootstrapping on platforms where we don't yet have PowerShell a pain (you have to generate the files elsewhere and bring them over). \n\nIt should be fairly straightforward to port this generation into a simple .NET Core project that our build script simply delegates to, bringing `Start-PSBuild` back to a convenience function (i.e. just runs a few `cmake` and `dotnet` commands).\n\nI think this should be done sooner than later because bootstrapping on other platforms needs to be doable by the average developer.\n\n/cc @FawcettJohnW @vors @ealexjordan @lzybkr \n",
