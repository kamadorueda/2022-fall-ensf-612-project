  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\n**Summary** - Could we get Set-Alias to support what Linux does just replace the alias with the text before execution? There's workaround without this in some case but not always. \r\n\r\nPowershell does not support set alias with parameters - eg \r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\liangzhu> set-alias -Name topone \"Select-Object -First 1\"\r\nPS C:\\Users\\liangzhu> 1,2,3 | topone\r\ntopone: The term 'Select-Object -First 1' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n```\r\nThere's one workaround I can do using function \r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\liangzhu> function toponef {$input | Select-Object -First 1}\r\nPS C:\\Users\\liangzhu> 1,2,3 |toponef\r\n1\r\n```\r\nHowever this brings a performance penalty in the case of pipeline input - if I run `dir c:\\ -s | topeonef` it will get to wait for the base stream completes (Compare to that - `dir c:\\ -s | Selelct-Object -First 1` works just fine ) \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to search for an  solution (https://stackoverflow.com/a/34832628) yet it has side effects with an error output with base stream (works with a simply array but not complicated like `dir`)  and indeed involves too much into powershell implementation internals that I'm afraid many beginner/intermediate user won't understand yet the scenario is just super common in day-to-day business. \r\n\r\n```\r\nPS C:\\Users\\liangzhu> Filter TerminateAfterOne {\r\n>>   $sp = { Select-Object -First 1 }.GetSteppablePipeline($MyInvocation.CommandOrigin)\r\n>>   $sp.Begin($true)\r\n>>   $sp.Process(0)\r\n>> }\r\nPS C:\\Users\\liangzhu> function toponef { begin {$c = 0} process {if (++$c -gt 1) {toponeFilter} else {$_}}}\r\nPS C:\\Users\\liangzhu> dir c:\\ -s | toponef\r\n\r\n    Directory: C:\\\r\n\r\nMode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name\r\n----                 -------------         ------ ----\r\nda---           5/19/2018 12:58 PM                _vNextUpgrade\r\nGet-ChildItem: System error.\r\n```\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
