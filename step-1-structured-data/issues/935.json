  "body": "For Linux, we should support the well-known [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). Microsoft's other cross-platform applications already do so (such as NuGet).\n\nThis should be done sooner than later, because this kind of change post-release is not fun (and requires making it backwards compatible with the original design).\n\nRight now, we stick the user profile and modules under `~/.powershell`, which was a totally arbitrarily chosen location. This should instead be `~/.config/powershell`, and respect the value of `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`.\n\nOne could argue that perhaps modules belong in `$XDG_DATA_HOME` (or `~/.local/share/powershell`) along with the PSReadLine history file.\n\nNow, the XDGBDS is not specifically aimed at OS X. We can do two things: follow the same layout (easier to do, NuGet does this, a lot of people expect it), or tweak the locations to use Apple's special `Library` directories (this is more complex and not as nice).\n",
