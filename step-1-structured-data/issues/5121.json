  "body": "Fix #3994 \r\n\r\nThe old implementation always set the new object's properties to null.\r\n\r\nThe original issue mentioned that the other `Clone` implementation in MatchString.cs had the same bug, but in fact it's correct because of the use of `MemberwiseClone`.\r\n\r\nI didn't much unit testing of C# code going on in the project (or maybe I missed it?). Should I add a test and if so, where?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n\r\nIf you are a PowerShell Team member, please make sure you choose the Reviewer(s) and Assignee for your PR.\r\nIf you are not from the PowerShell Team, you can leave the fields blank and the Maintainers will choose them for you.
