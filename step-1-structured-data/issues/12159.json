  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\nHave the \"Get-Help -ShowWindow\" option show the resulting window with a dark/inverse mode, where the background is black and the text is white, or follow the system theme option like Windows 10 now has for light/dark.  \r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\nPossible options for specifying light/dark:\r\n- If running Windows, then follow the system theme setting\r\n- New PSPreferences variable\r\n- Another switch on Get-Help like -ShowDarkWindow or -Dark\r\n\r\nThis is by no means a high priority.  With the new Windows Terminal and VScode now being nice with theming capabilities, this would be an eye-friendly enhancement.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
