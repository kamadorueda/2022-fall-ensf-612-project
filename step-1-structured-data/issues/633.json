  "body": "This brings in the .NET updates necessary to resolve #617 (and transitively #571, #461, #484, and test #613).\n\nNote that the compatibility package we're using is hand-built and stored in our local NuGet feed in the `windows-build` repo, thus this PR requires PowerShell/psl-windows-build#7.\n\nCLI has also been bumped to the greatest common denominator across the platforms (and that is available in the apt feed).\n",
