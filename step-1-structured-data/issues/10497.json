The shell is usable while its open, but when the time runs out, it closes, whether or not any commands have been entered.\r\n\r\nI have a console with PowerShell 6.2.2 open at the same time, and it remains open without incident.\r\n\r\nI am NOT an avid Linux user, so I don't know much about how it works.",

Its updated itself many times from the automatic updates from within the operating system.  I use it very little, only to try testing open source cross platform software, once in a while.  I accesses it with the enhanced session and the Xorg Xrdp connector.",
