  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nAs a user, if I install PowerShell on a Mac or Linux computer, I would want to be able to manage it remotely using the SSH protocol. I must currently manually edit the `sshd_config` file to enable the PowerShell SSH subsystem on each target computer, or otherwise the `New-PSSession` cmdlet will emit a nonintuitive error. (See #9925 for more details.) I would appreciate it if the PowerShell prebuilt installers would add the appropriate code to the `sshd_config` file during installation, so I don't have to remember to do this manually.\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nI would add the following code to the macOS after-install script:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ngrep -E -q \"^Subsystem\\s*powershell\" /etc/ssh/sshd_config || \\\r\necho \"Subsystem powershell {0} -sshs -NoLogo -NoProfile\" >> /etc/ssh/sshd_config\r\n```\r\n\r\n(As with the existing code in the macOS after-install script, `{0}` will be replaced with the full path to the pwsh executable.)\r\n\r\nSomething similar ought to be done for the Linux installers; however, I am not fluent enough with the PowerShell Linux packaging to offer any specific implementation plans there. Thanks!",
