      "body": "This is actually a bug that got fixed by PR #4709. There are 9 special automatic variables that are always available for every script run: `$_`, `$args`, `$this`, `$input`, `$PSCmdlet`, `$PSBoundParameters`, `$MyInvocation`, `$PSScriptRoot` and `$PSCommandPath`. When any of those variables are set, accessing the variables from within the script will get you those values. \r\n\r\n`$args`, `$input`, `$PSBoundParameters` are set to default values when it's not applicable; `$MyInvocation` is set to the script that's about to run; `$PSScriptRoot` and `$PSCommandPath` are set with the paths if the script is defined in a file, or an empty string if not; `$_`, `$this` may not be set depending on whether it's applicable; `$PSCmdlet` is set only for script cmdlets.\r\n\r\nThe long-standing bug here is that when dot-sourcing script cmdlets (functions with `[CmdletBinding()]` or `[Parameter()]` attributes declared), those special variables are not properly set up before parameter binding -- they were set up after parameter binding. So using them for default parameter values will not get you the correct values, but using them in the script body will work as expected. For example, you can see the behavior by running the following in powershell prior to beta.7:\r\n```\r\nfunction ScriptCmdlet {\r\n    [CmdletBinding()]\r\n    param($Invocation = $MyInvocation)\r\n\r\n    \"`$Invocation: $($Invocation.MyCommand.Name)\"\r\n    \"`$MyInvocation: $($MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name)\"\r\n}\r\nPS:49> . ScriptCmdlet\r\n$Invocation:\r\n$MyInvocation: ScriptCmdlet\r\n```\r\nHowever, for simple functions (functions or scirpts that **don't** have `[CmdletBinding()]` or `[Parameter()]` attributes declared), those special variables have always been properly set up before parameter binding. See this example in any powershell versions:\r\n```\r\nfunction SimpleFunction {\r\n    param($Invocation = $MyInvocation)\r\n\r\n    \"`$Invocation: $($Invocation.MyCommand.Name)\"\r\n    \"`$MyInvocation: $($MyInvocation.MyCommand.Name)\"\r\n}\r\nPS:51> . SimpleFunction\r\n$Invocation: SimpleFunction\r\n$MyInvocation: SimpleFunction\r\n```\r\nAs you may already know, this inconsistent behavior has been there for years until the issue #4688 was reported. And then it was fixed by PR #4709.\r\n",
