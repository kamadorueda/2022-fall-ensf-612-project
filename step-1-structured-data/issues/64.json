      "body": "In C#, there's a piece of magic that can make one assemblies internals available to another. It is this [`[assembly:InternalsVisibleTo(\"powershell-tests\")]`](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/src/System.Management.Automation/AssemblyInfo.cs#L11) code.\n\nThis should make the internal class visible within the xUnit tests.\n\nAs an example, we use it [here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/test/csharp/test_Runspace.cs#L123).\n\nHere is the definition of [`SessionStateInternal`](https://github.com/PowerShell/psl-monad/blob/962c653ba3338da6afdb413231a540d7ff260cf7/monad/src/engine/SessionState.cs#L22).\n\nNavigating the PowerShell codebase is... an experience. I _highly_ recommend setting up tags. I personally use [GNU Global](https://www.gnu.org/software/global/) with [ggtags](https://github.com/leoliu/ggtags/) in Emacs. In Vim, [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) is great (it can be used with Emacs too with a little digger). Until tags are setup, the quickest way to find things is to `grep` or [`ag`](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) the source in `psl-monad/monad/src/engine/`, and if it's not in `engine`, go up a directory.\n",
