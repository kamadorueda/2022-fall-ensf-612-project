  "body": "This change contains some minor improvements to the SSH remoting.  This includes cmdlets parameter name change but keep in mind that SSH remoting is still in alpha stage and that the cmdlet parameter sets are likely to change in the future.  I'll be submitting an RFC for proposed final parameter sets in the (hopefully) near future, but in the mean this is meant to fix some of the current issues.\n1. The KeyPath parameter name has been changed to KeyFilePath to be more descriptive.\n2. HostName and UserName cmdlet parameters are now marked \"mandatory\".\n3. Added path resolution to handle partial key file paths.\n4. Added key path file existence check before starting ssh client.\n5. SSH client warning messages are now written to host.\n6. Improved SSH client error messages.\n7. Added some tests for SSH cmdlets and remoting API.\n",
