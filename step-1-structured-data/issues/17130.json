Writing pwsh in the console just returns \"command not found\".\r\n\r\nTried the latest stable 7.2.2 release as well, but it won't even start the installer without Rosetta.\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nExpect macOS ARM64 build to work natively without Rosetta layer.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nPrompted to install Rosetta after installation. pwsh command not found in terminal.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nNot applicable.\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "So I figured out the issue: the preview version uses pwsh-preview instead of just pwsh to start powershell. I also managed to install the stable 7.2.2 version by [installing the binary archives](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos?view=powershell-7.1#binary-archives) instead of the .pkg installer. This however doesn't include the launch pad Powershell entry.\r\n\r\nWhat exactly does launching Powershell from launch pad do and why does it require Rosetta? And also, the documentation mentions that dependencies have to be manually installed when installing using the binary archive method. Which dependencies are missing that are included with the .pkg installer?",

It\u2019s possible Mac OS is seeing something in there and thinking it a legacy x86 app.  I can\u2019t verify any of this as I do not have an arm Mac. ",
