I did create a custom Terminal.app profile (in blue no less!), maybe we can include a custom Terminal Profile in the installer package?\n\nYou were correct about the .NET Core Console Class. A quick C# console application executed from the default Terminal profile exhibits the same behavior.\n\n```\n            Console.WriteLine(\"What is your name?\");\n            var name = Console.ReadLine();\n            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello, {0}!\", name);\n```\n\n```\n$ dotnet bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.0/dotNetConsole.dll \nWhat is your name?\nOpOqOrOsOtOuOvOwOxOy\nHello, OpOqOrOsOtOuOvOwOxOy!\n```\n\nIf a user is going to install .NET core and develop in it, it might be something that they can figure out, but it's probably worth mentioning in a readme.\n\nI created a PowerShell terminal with settings that work for me here: https://gist.github.com/michaelsaul/fc289abc59c9742086635c80f19b7457\n\nThanks so much!\n",
