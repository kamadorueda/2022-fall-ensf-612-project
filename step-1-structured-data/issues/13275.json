  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nCopy the following text and paste it in powershell:\r\n```powershell\r\necho hello\r\n#\tcomment\r\necho world\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nShould print `hello` and `world`.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nPrints `hello`, `hellocomment`, and `world`\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n\r\nWhat happens is that pasting the `#` character followed by a tab character triggers tab-completion and completes to the last command.\r\nSo the result is the previous command, `echo hello`, and then the comment text, `comment`, which results in `echo hellocomment`.\r\n\r\nThis is very unexpected. I had a function with a comment which had an indentation inside it, and the function broke when I pasted its definition in powershell.\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
