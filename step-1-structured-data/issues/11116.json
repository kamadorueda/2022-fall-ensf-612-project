  "body": "By default (where no parameters are supplied except for the `$InputObject`) for the [`Where-Object`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/where-object?view=powershell-6), filter `$Null` \"_objects_\" from the pipeline.\r\n\r\nThis request is related to #10704 and its lengthy discussion which concerns matching _properties_ with `$Null` rather than the current _object_with `$Null`.\r\n\r\nSome (custom) cmdlets appear to put `$Null` values in the pipeline which might lead to problems as it causes an unexpected iteration. (see e.g. [How to handle $null in the pipeline](https://stackoverflow.com/q/4356758/1701026)):\r\n\r\n`1,$Null,2,3 | ForEach-Object {$_}` produces **3** numbers\r\nwhere\r\n`1,$Null,2,3 | ForEach-Object {'Hi'}` produces **4** `Hi`'s\r\n\r\nThe current solution to this is to filter the `$Null` objects using the `Where-Object`:\r\n\r\n`1,$Null,2,3 | Where-Object {$Null -ne $_} | ForEach-Object {'Hi'}`\r\n<sub>(but as in the example stackoverflow question/answer this is often done incorrectly with `$Null` at wrong side of the  equality operator, and maybe should be even `$_ -isnot $Null`.)<sub>\r\n\r\nAt the moment (PowerShell version 6.2.3) the `Where-Object` requires at least an extra mandatory parameter besides the `$InputObject`:\r\n\r\n**`1,$Null,2,3 | Where-Object | ForEach-Object {'Hi'}`**\r\nResults in:\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> >>\r\n> \r\n> cmdlet Where-Object at command pipeline position 1\r\n> Supply values for the following parameters:\r\n> FilterScript:\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if the default `FilterScript` for the `Where-Object` cmdlet is set to something like `{$Null -ne $_}` (or `{$_ -isnot $Null}`) which should than appropriately filter out anything that is not an object (`$null`'s), so that a syntax like `1,$Null,2,3 | Where-Object | ForEach-Object {'Hi'}` will just produce 3 `Hi`'s.\r\n",
