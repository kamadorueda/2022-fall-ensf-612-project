      "body": "`Send-MailMessage` cmdlet uses .NET Core `System.Net.SmtpClient` class, which only supports STARTTLS connections (Port 587) and not SMTPS connections (Port 465). So @eben562012 should be right using Port 587.\r\nHere is the description of `System.Net.SmtpClient` class with the [`EnableSsl`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.net.mail.smtpclient.enablessl?view=netframework-4.7.2#System_Net_Mail_SmtpClient_EnableSsl) property:\r\n\r\n> The SmtpClient class only supports the SMTP Service Extension for Secure SMTP over Transport Layer Security as defined in RFC 3207. In this mode, the SMTP session begins on an unencrypted channel, then a STARTTLS command is issued by the client to the server to switch to secure communication using SSL. See RFC 3207 published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for more information.\r\nAn alternate connection method is where an SSL session is established up front before any protocol commands are sent. This connection method is sometimes called SMTP/SSL, SMTP over SSL, or SMTPS and by default uses port 465. This alternate connection method using SSL is not currently supported. \r\n\r\nThe last sentence is the important one. Implicit SSL over 465 is not supported for `System.Net.SmtpClient` and therefore also not supported for the `Send-MailMessage` cmdlet.\r\n\r\nStill STARTTLS switch from an unsecure connection to secure connection on Port 587 **should** be supported. Also the [documentation of Google](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/7126229?hl=en) shows that STARTTLS is supported on Port 587.\r\n\r\n> \r\n\r\nOutgoing Mail (SMTP) Server | smtp.gmail.com <br/> Requires SSL: Yes <br/> Requires TLS: Yes (if available)  <br/> Requires Authentication: Yes  <br/> Port for SSL: 465  <br/>  Port for TLS/STARTTLS: 587\r\n-- | --\r\n\r\n@TravisEz13 and @eben562012  If you agree and give me a couple of days, I would be willing to investigate further.\r\n",

      "body": "Well, didn't take days only a couple of minutes \ud83d\ude00\r\nGoogle, as well as other mail providers these days are not allowing unsecure connections per default. Since the STARTTLS connection initiation allows starts with an unsecure connection and later switching to a secure connection, those client connections are blocked by mail providers with best practice security guidelines.\r\n\r\nOnce I tried the example of @eben562012 I immediately got a notification from Google that someone tried to authenticate with an **unsecure** device.\r\n\r\nActually the problem is easy to solve, though **NOT** recommended at all. One could modify in the Google account settings to allow \"less secure app access\":\r\n![651b04ee-6ac3-44fe-a6f9-f5b7d9f26d87 png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22521159/53681291-a54e6100-3ce7-11e9-9ab1-b1d2c5bdbd29.jpg)\r\n\r\nAnd voila, the mail was sent without any error or any alert mail from Google. BUT, from a security perspective this is NOT recommended at all! Google will warn you in the user account settings about it multiple times. Most prominently with this one:\r\n![6a5e3ff4-7cd0-4f53-9054-ddd3d29d8ad5 png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22521159/53681318-18f06e00-3ce8-11e9-978c-3f463b2d180f.jpg)\r\n\r\nSo the resolution for this issue is EXTERNAL. Either by modifying your Google account settings as shown above or by enhancing `System.Net.SmtpClient` class in the [.NET CoreFX repo](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.Net.Mail/src/System/Net/Mail).\r\nLater one will be highly unlikely since the class is [flagged as deprecated or not recommended for new projects](https://github.com/dotnet/platform-compat/blob/master/docs/DE0005.md), since a lot of modern mail functionality is missing.\r\n\r\n> DE0005: SmtpClient shouldn't be used\r\nMotivation\r\nSmtpClient doesn't support many modern protocols. It is compat-only. It's great for one off emails from tools, but doesn't scale to modern requirements of the protocol.\r\nRecommendation\r\nUse MailKit or other libraries.\r\n\r\nJust for the sake of completeness: The example of @eben562012 was TESTED on `PowerShell 6.2.0-preview.4` and `Windows PowerShell 5.1.18346.1` and works fine when the Google account settings are modified accordingly.\r\n\r\n@eben562012 Is it ok for you, if @TravisEz13 would close the issue, since not much can be done here at the PowerShell source level?\r\n",

You might want to review \"Your devices\" in the account settings:\r\n![88f11d95-36a3-49ae-bae7-5daba2081f5e png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22521159/53681518-2529fa80-3ceb-11e9-99d9-1779f29a4424.jpg)\r\n\r\nHere is the code I used:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$mycredentials = Get-Credential\r\nSend-MailMessage -SmtpServer smtp.gmail.com -Port 587 -UseSsl -From youruser@gmail.com -To someotheruser@gmail.com -Subject Test -Credential $mycredentials",
