The XML Schema file `cmdlets-over-objects.xsd` is missing in Github\r\n2. The resource string `CmdletizationCoreResources.Xml_cmdletsOverObjectsXsd` likely needs to be reworked to make the schema validation work.\r\n",

Due to the file not being present in the GitHub repo, I would need to conditionally exclude this code not only for coreclr but also additionaly for fullclr now as I plan to open a PR for #7408 soon",

When I did the proof of concept of compiling SMA for full .Net, I made the assumption that I should not define the `CORECLR` constant for this compilation configuration. Maybe this was a mistake, which would mean that this file would then not be needed.",
