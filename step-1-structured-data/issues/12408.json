      "body": "Please use the appropriate issue template and provide some more details; these terms are heavily contextual and it's not especially useful to explain them devoid of context.\r\n\r\nIn essence, **coercion** is implicit; `\"5\" + 10` results in the string `\"510\"` rather than a numeral `15` or an error. Conversion or casting is typically explicit: `[int]'5'` gets you back the actual number to work with rather than a string.",
