My intuition is that using the cache will be slower that building, unless that made the caching an order of magnitude faster than other artifacts operations.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know either way.\r\n\r\nOne way to make this work would be to:\r\n\r\n1. Restore the cache(s)\r\n1. make the `-SkipTestToolBuild` build if the files are not there and use this in CI\r\n1. save the cache(s)",
