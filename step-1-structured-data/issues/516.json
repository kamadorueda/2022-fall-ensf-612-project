  "body": "As an easier way to demonstrate PowerShell (on Linux) for those who don't want to build it, we'll make a Debian package we can just share internally. Then the requirements to try the demo will simply be: create an Ubuntu 14.04 VM (a few clicks in Azure), download the `powershell.deb` package; `sudo dpkg -i powershell.deb`, and run `powershell`.\n\nThis will also be nice to start self-hosting.\n\nI am going to utilize the .NET CLI team's [Debian Package Tool](https://github.com/dotnet/cli/tree/rel/1.0.0/packaging/debian/package_tool).\n",
