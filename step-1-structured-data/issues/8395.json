  "body": "# Support Question\r\nI was configuring Java path variables. When I used ``%JAVA_HOME%\\bin`` in ``Path`` variable, ``java --version`` only worked in cmd (both with common user and admin), but reported ``Can't load java.dll`` in Powershell (both with common user or admin)(the same after rebooting). However, when I used ``C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk11.0.1\\bin`` instead, everything worked normally. Can somebody tell me what went wrong?\r\n## Official support\r\n\r\n[PowerShell Support Lifecycle](http://aka.ms/pslifecycle)\r\n\r\n## Community Resources\r\n\r\n[Slack Community Chat](https://powershell.slack.com) - Interactive chat with other PowerShell enthusiasts\r\n[PowerShell.org Forum](https://powershell.org/forums/) - Search or post new general PowerShell usage questions\r\n",
