      "body": "I always find that ticking the first 3 checkboxes is a pointless exercise. They should be just one checkbox stating something like `PR summary/title follows rules here` with a link to a more or less detailed document section describing it.\r\nYou cannot force people to do stuff (or get better results) by having more checkboxes. The best example is your 'summary' that is a copy paste of the title. I also did not find the title meaningful at all because I only knew what it was about the PR template once I looked at the diff.\r\nThe other improvements I find good though, sorry for ranting.\r\nI only have 1 question: why do you need NA specifically? If a checkbox is not ticked then can one not assume that it is not applicable?",

      "body": "@bergmeister I agree partially on the first 3 checkboxes and updated the checklist, but just because we can't force people doesn't mean we can't remind them.  As a maintainer, the results are much better with the checklist.\r\n\r\nThe problem with using unchecked as not applicable could mean they haven't gotten around to it or that it's not applicable, but I think I would be ok with it.  I added the maintainers and Steve for additional feedback.",
