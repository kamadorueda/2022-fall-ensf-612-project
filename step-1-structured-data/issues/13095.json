  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n\r\nCompress a list of ~300 text files(~20M for each, in folder Data2020), using following command with pipeline in powershell core 7:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\ntar cvf - Data2020 | zstd - -o Data2020.tar.zst\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nCompression stream won't consume too much memory, and the command should be fast.\r\n\r\nAfter the failed try in ps core 7, I ran it again in cmd in *cmder terminal* or windows terminal. It actually ran well:\r\n\r\n![b](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16264393/86511851-84dc6c80-be2f-11ea-8f92-28106aa0fa01.png)\r\n\r\nMemory usage kept around 50 MB.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nWhenI ran the command in windows terminal. After over 3 minutes, only about 60 files were compressed and memory usage\r\n\r\nsurged to over 5GB and still increased quickly. I close all the other apps but the command eat up even more memory and \r\n\r\ndidn't seem to finish, so I killed the process with `ctrl + c`. But memory usage didn't decline:\r\n\r\n![a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16264393/86511936-2237a080-be30-11ea-82a3-bf054ec146b5.png)\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
