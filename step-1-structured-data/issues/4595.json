We need to write it down for everyone to see and refer back to. \r\n\r\nThe idea is that comments may be added to a PR that are considered non-blocking and should not hold up a pull request. We want to preserve the feedback and document it so that it may be addressed at a later time. The way to handle it is to file a new issue covering the topic and note it in the PR.",
