  "body": "I was attempting to validate an optional parameter, but I realized that also more or less makes it mandatory, because now it is forced to have a value. So I attempted to use empty string as a valid possibility, but that also has issues.\r\n\r\nSo I have two issues here:\r\n1) If a parameter is not mandatory, why is validate set running when the parameter is not supplied, does it look the same as passing in a null value and therefore cannot be determined if it is absent?\r\n2) If empty string is a valid value in ValidateSet, then I expect tab completion to work. This would also be fine on mandatory parameters if AllowEmpyString or AllowNull are also provided.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nparam([ValidateSet('', \"Test\")]\r\n          [string] $Param)\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nEmpty string should either show up in tab completion OR tab completion should ignore it, display all non-empty values, and allow the parameter to be left out (i.e. empty).\r\n```\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n```none\r\nTab completion does NOT work at all when empty string is provided as a valid value. Note: that the set validation DOES work fine, i.e. I can still only provide empty string or \"Test\" as values and all other values error, but the empty string breaks tab completion. This seems like very confusing behavior, if it works I would expect tab completion, if it is not supported I would expect it error or get ignored all together.\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.0-preview.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.1.0-preview.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.16299\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

Do you mean something else by \"not supplied\"?\r\n\r\n> If empty string is a valid value in ValidateSet, then I expect tab completion to work\r\n\r\nYes, that cycling through valid values stops working if you tab-complete without having typed at least one characters is unexpected.\r\n",
