      "body": "My text encoding was set to \"UTF-8\" in the Terminal app. While research how to change the locale I came across this [article](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/os-x-terminal-bash-warning-setlocale-lc_ctype-cannot-change-locale/) which was helpful.  Unchecking the **Terminal > Preferences > Advanced > Set locale environment variables on startup** corrected the issue.\r\n\r\nThat being said should the build documentation be update with this tidbit as **Set locale environment variables on startup** is checked by default in macOS 10.12 (Sierra). I know 10.12 isn't officially supported yet but this will be an issue moving forward. I do not have access to a 10.11 machine so I cant tell you what the default setting there is.\r\n\r\nWith **Set locale environment variables on startup** checked.\r\n``` bash\r\nthezim@foobarhost ~ $ locale\r\nLANG=\r\nLC_COLLATE=\"C\"\r\nLC_CTYPE=\"C\"\r\nLC_MESSAGES=\"C\"\r\nLC_MONETARY=\"C\"\r\nLC_NUMERIC=\"C\"\r\nLC_TIME=\"C\"\r\nLC_ALL=\r\nthezim@foobarhost ~ $ \r\n```\r\n\r\nWith **Set locale environment variables on startup** unchecked.\r\n``` bash\r\nthezim@foobarhost ~ $ locale\r\nLANG=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\r\nLC_COLLATE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\r\nLC_CTYPE=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\r\nLC_MESSAGES=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\r\nLC_MONETARY=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\r\nLC_NUMERIC=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\r\nLC_TIME=\"en_US.UTF-8\"\r\nLC_ALL=\r\nthezim@foobarhost ~ $ \r\n```",
