If there are non hiden params it shows them instead.\r\nIn PS 7  if a class has only hidden params it shows blank lines.\r\n```powershell\r\nclass Empty {\r\n    MyClass() { }\r\n    [String]ToString() { return 'MyString' }\r\n}\r\n[Empty]::new()\r\n# Will Show \"MyString\"\r\n\r\nclass Hidden {\r\n    hidden $Param = 'Foo'\r\n    MyClass() { }\r\n    [String]ToString() { return 'MyString' }\r\n}\r\n[Hidden]::new()\r\n# On PS < 7 Will Show \"MyString\"\r\n# On PS 7 Will Show \"2 blank lines\"\r\n\r\nclass Params {\r\n    $Param = 'Foo'\r\n    MyClass() { }\r\n    [String]ToString() { return 'MyString' }\r\n}\r\n[Params]::new()\r\n<# Will Show:\r\nParam\r\n-----\r\nFoo\r\n#>\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nIf there are only hidden params show the ToString() like in PS6\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nIf there are only hidden params it shows blank lines like it tries to show the params but have noting to show.",
