  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nI wrote some files for me and the problem is that some files included another and other can include another and so on. So better if files can included only once.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nI make the global variable: path to included files and include files via it from a main script and in other files include another files with this path, so I include always absolute paths. So may be it's not a problem to include files only one time especially if they include with full path. ",

Yes, I read about modules but I didn't know that modules haven't to be installed before using. I will try and return.",

      "body": "Hello. Modules don't solve the problem when one module depends on another and one of them depends on the previous imported. Powershell can't work this way - it try recursvely add modules and stops running with it.\r\n\r\nSo I added check if this module was added by some variable initialization, but there is a problem. If I run my script via IDE I have to remove this variables before adding modules. It's inconvenient. And there is no difference between Import-Module or simply adding by '.\\scrips.ps1'. So if no diff I prefer point.\r\n\r\nI use my script library and change it from time to time. Also I use it from different computers. That's why importing to computer is inconvenient too.",
