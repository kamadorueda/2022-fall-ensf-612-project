  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nShells such Bash, Zsh, Fish, Ksh expose their version as an environment variable, usually in the form of `{ShellName}_VERSION`. This makes it easy for a child processes and scripts to implement shell-specific code paths, e.g.:\r\n\r\n- modifying shell profile file for current shell: `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc...\r\n- outputting eval code for specific shell: `eval \"$(docker-machine env default)\"`\r\n\r\nDocs:\r\n- https://www.gnu.org/savannah-checkouts/gnu/bash/manual/bash.html#Bash-Variables (`BASH_VERSION`)\r\n- https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Parameters.html#index-ZSH_005fVERSION (`ZSH_VERSION`)\r\n- https://fishshell.com/docs/current/language.html#special-variables (`FISH_VERSION`)\r\n- https://linux.die.net/man/1/ksh (`KSH_VERSION`)\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nPowerShell should expose an environment variable with it's version, e.g.: `PWSH_VERSION`\r\nThis is very easy to implement, has infinitesimally low chance of breaking something and would perfectly align with what other shells do.",
