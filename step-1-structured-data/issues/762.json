  "body": "- Merge changes from source-depot branch 5386c71bb\n- Add `Start-ResGen` to `PowerShellGitHubDev.psm1`\n  So now everybody can regenerate C# binding locally, when needed\n\nWe still keep them into a sub-module, until `dotnet cli` will suport C# binding generation.\nThe reason is: we need to be able to build PS without having PS on the system, so we keep binding in a submodule.\n- In windows-build submodule, move C# binding to the real project names. I.e. `gen\\SYS_AUTO` to `gen\\System.Management.Automation`\n\n**Review note:** please, do the review per commit: file changes are the mix of `source-depot` merge and real changes. It would be much easier to do the review per commit.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/762)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
