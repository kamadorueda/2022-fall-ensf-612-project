So it only honors the `$iis` partially -- the variables added but not those removed.",

      "body": "The Engine-WG reviewed this issue. The current behavior has been there since at least PowerShell v3, and it's risky to break the current behavior. It would be nice to have `CheckPoint` and `Restore` capabilities for `Runspace`, so it can be restored to a previous state, but that would be complicated if not infeasible. So, for now, we decided to close this issue as won't fix.",
