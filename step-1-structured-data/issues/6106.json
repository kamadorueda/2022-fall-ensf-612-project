  "body": "Dear Guys,\r\n\r\nWe tried to install  install .NET-4.5.2-KB2901907-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe on the remote Window Server 2008 R2 by remote PowerShell over WinRM from another server. As we known that the default PowerShell Version on  Window Server 2008 R2 is v2, it failed and throw the below exception when I run the below command after using Enter-PSSession PowerShell command to connect to the remote Windows 2008R2 server.\r\n@ The command: c:\\setup\\.NET-4.5.2-KB2901907-x86-x64-AllOS-ENU.exe /q /log c:/setup/install.log\r\n@  The Exception is as below: An error was encountered. Unspecified error.\r\n\r\nIs there any limitation for remote Powershell on Window Server 2008R2 to stop the above PowerShell command to install .NET 4.5.2? By the way, the same remote PowerShell command by WinRM can run successfully on Windows 2012 R2. Is there any difference between them?\r\n\r\nIt is a little urgent and right now it blocked us, Any help is much appreciated in advanced.\r\n",
