Something is going on with the Write-Progress in both Window PowerShell Core and in Linux.\r\n\r\nEither it seems to go too fast to see on screen when it should \"display a progress bar\".\r\n\r\nIn Windows PowerShell Core it flashes too fast. Then, in Linux, it doesn't show anything.\r\nNo errors are displayed.\r\n\r\nI'm following a simple sample from the Get-Help Write-Progress:\r\n```\r\nfor ($I = 1; $I -le 100; $I++ )\r\n    {Write-Progress -Activity \"Search in Progress\" -Status \"$I% Complete:\" -PercentComplete $I;}\r\n```\r\nIf the purpose of Write-Progress is to show a progress bar then it isn't working as expected.\r\n\r\n:)",

      "body": "@iSazonov is this related to #2822? In Windows `write-progress \"something\"; Start-Sleep 5` will show the progress bar. But on macOS and Linux it will not. but if I add more operations (similar to what @MaximoTrinidad provided) I do see the progress bar. \r\n\r\n@MaximoTrinidad I believe what you are seeing with that example is that the loop completes too quickly. Due to improvements in the `write-progress` system, quick operations may not display the progress. Increase from 100 to 10000 and you are likely to see it. \r\n\r\n",

And if that's too performance impacting, , maybe allow -force to make it show up that first time? Especially since on MacOS at least, it allocates the extra lines it would display into whether it displays or not.\r\n",
