By any chance, have you try just to run the only the powershell calling the script at the bash console by itself (just like in my print screen image).  Just to make sure script runs.\r\n\r\n:)",

It lonely work if the script is stored in the local folder where you're executing PowerShell with the script.\r\n\r\nEven at the console I can't even do a \"powershell ./mnt/c/Scripts/TestDir.ps1\" as it doesn't recognize the \".ps1\" extension or more likely the path to it.

Really appreciate it!\r\n\r\nSo, I've done some more tests based on someone's post on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44087451/running-a-powershell-file-from-java-says-the-file-does-not-have-a-ps1-extensi/44124246#44124246). \r\n\r\nIn Linux, at least on Fedora 25, the following is not working (but is working fine on a Mac as stated in the post above of @ebrucucen and on StackOverflow):\r\n\r\n```\r\nString command = \"powershell -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -NoProfile   \r\n-NonInteractive -File //home//b//Downloads//MyScript.ps1\";\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis made me try the following, which works perfectly fine on Linux as confirmed by @MaximoTrinidad too:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString command = \"powershell -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -NoProfile \r\n-NonInteractive -File /home/b/Downloads/MyScript.ps1\";\r\n```\r\nThe only problem left now is how to call a script from within Java on Linux that has spaces in it's path? This part still doesn't work. The following doesn't work for example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nString command = \"powershell -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -NoProfile \r\n-NonInteractive -File /home/b/Downloads/My script has spaces.ps1\";\r\n```",
