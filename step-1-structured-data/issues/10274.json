I am wary of modifying any script run by the user ... if there is an error or unexpected behavior, then it becomes confusing for the user to understand what is wrong with their script.\r\n\r\nI think a better way may be to set the working directory path when the job child process is created.  This can be done as a PowerShell (pwsh) argument e.g., \r\n`pwsh.exe -WorkingDirectory ...`.\r\n\r\nOr it can be done in the dotNet StartInfo property when creating the child process.\r\n`_startInfo.WorkingDirectory = ...`\r\n\r\nPlease take a look at PowerShellProcessInstance.cs source file.",

      "body": "@PaulHigin @KirkMunro \r\n\r\nI have looked at the code you mention ( that was my original approach) but to my suprise it does not work. At least with the current implementation. I have already posted some of this on #4287 and I would love to get your input. I re-post it here for convience:\r\n\r\n### Changing the working directory of the pwsh remote server:\r\n1. The command line argument `workingdirectory` does not work when the pwsh process runs in server mode (-s flag). See [consolehost.cs](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/3ca5a1bdb031eeb9453b1481bcfa23eee6d89aec/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ConsoleHost.cs#L204). The function that initiates the process into server mode does not even take into consideration the working directory parameter provided by the user.\r\n\r\n2. Using `_startInfo.WorkingDirectory = ...` also did not work either. The surprising part here ( at least for me) was that even though the new process working directory was the one specified by the process `_startInfo` the initial location did not change. I used process explorer [source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer) to verify that the process working directory was passed correctly.\r\n\r\n### Thoughts & Questions\r\n\r\n1. Since the InitializationScript parameter of the cmdlet is passed to the process startupInfo as part of the process arguments, I do not see how we could have a workingDirectory parameter for Start-Job that would be able to set the working directory also for the InitializationScript. Unless we enable the `workingDirectory` parameter in `serverMode`. Is this part of the requirement?\r\n\r\n2. Do you think that enabling the `workingDirectory` parameter when powershell runs in server mode is a good addition?\r\n\r\n3. Is there documentation (or some old issue that I could read to understand better) on the communication protocol between PowerShell and Powershell server mode? \r\n\r\nLet me know what you think :) ",

      "body": "Ok, well I can't say I understand how dotNet StartInfo works, but it seems like the WorkingDirectory parameter is ignored in some (non ShellExecute) cases.  PowerShell does not seem to set initial working directory location except for the case where the -WorkingDirectory command parameter is used.\r\n\r\nThe only alternative I see for Start-Job is to pass the   -WorkingDirectory argument to the Run method that starts PowerShell running in server mode.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/d84ebc157196e80c9ddb116f351bf633fd1340e7/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.ConsoleHost/host/msh/ConsoleHost.cs#L204\r\n```\r\nSystem.Management.Automation.Remoting.Server.OutOfProcessMediator.Run(s_cpp.InitialCommand, s_cpp.WorkingDirectory);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then pass it on through to server session creation until it reaches the ServerRunspacePool constructor, similar to configurationName argument.  Then in the runspace creation handler, run the `Set-Location` command before running initialization scripts.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/cf7699b4b9bb96bac906a7052f890d524f375677/src/System.Management.Automation/engine/remoting/server/ServerRunspacePoolDriver.cs#L619",
