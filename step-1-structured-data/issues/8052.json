  "body": "Many modules exists out there to allow Throttling of parallel jobs/tasks. And the main reasons people use them are for simple throttling of tasks. \r\n\r\nEx: \r\n````\r\n$Computers = Get-Content 'computers.txt'\r\nInvoke-Command -ScriptBlock { \r\n    Param($Computer) \r\n    Test-Connection $Computer\r\n} -ThrottleLimit 5 -ArgumentList $Computers\r\n````\r\n\r\nDo I really need to enable Powershell Remoting to execute this simple task? \r\n\r\nIf it's impossible to do with Invoke-Command, I would suggest adding ThrottleLimit to Start-Job.

But why not enable it for local execution? Even if it uses jobs internally, or some other mechanism. Why make the user download an external module?\r\n",

      "body": "@mkellerman as @iSazonov pointed out, `Start-ThreadJob` has a `-ThrottleLimit` parameter.  `Start-Job` probably should have it as well...  As you noticed, `Invoke-Command` has `-ThottleLimit` when used with remoting which makes sense.  You could point `Invoke-Command` to localhost, but I think `Start-ThreadJob` is a much better existing solution.",
