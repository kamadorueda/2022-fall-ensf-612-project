      "body": "Some applications use GUID as a unique identifier. In this case, the identifier is a string. So really, we can get a stream of strings (ex. from logs), that we want to convert to `[guid]`. And yes this is more for `ConvertTo-Guid` but I looked through `New-*` cmdlets and many of them do a similar operation (string -> object). Most likely the new `ConvertTo-Guid` cmdlet is redundant and perhaps it would be better to make the `GUID` parameter.\r\n\r\nActually I'm surprised that `New-Guid` has appeared. But if it is, then it is logical to realize a full set of features including `Empty`. It is also used by some applications (ex. SCCM).\r\n\r\nIf we do not do `Guid` and `Empty` and do not use `pipeline` there is an option to make a breaking change and remove `New-Guid` because there is `[guid]`.",
