      "body": "It's hard to tell from the spelling test output which specific words it's failing on, but to me it looks like in each case it's Pester domain-specific words like `AfterEach` and `BeforeEach`. The page doesn't currently mark each of these as inline code (that was true before my improvements) and I don't know if doing so would make them excluded from the spelling check and/or is necessary/desirable.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure this PR has not introduced any new spelling mistakes, and I think it is an improvement on the previous version of this page, so my suggestion would be to merge it and iterate with further versions for other improvements.\r\n\r\nIf you can provide more specifics on spellings that you want edited however I'm happy to implement.",
