  "body": "## PR Summary\r\n\r\nFix #5783\r\nFix running `pwsh` from the parent folder of the `publish` folder after `Start-PSBuild -Clean`. (e.g. `C:\\PowerShell\\src\\powershell-win-core\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp2.0\\win7-x64`).\r\nThis also enables running `dotnet pwsh.dll` after building with `dotnet build`.\r\n\r\n### Root Cause\r\n1. The file `powershell.config.json` is not bin-placed to the output directory by the build, which might cause loading `PSReadline` to fail due to the execution policy.\r\n2. `Runspace.PrimaryRunspace` was set in `OpenConsoleRunspace` before the Runspace has been successfully opened. When the first attempt to open the default Runspace fails because of the failure to load `PSReadline`, `OpenConsoleRunspace` will be called again to open the Runspace without `PSReadline`, but `Runspace.PrimaryRunspace` has already been set and thus caused the crash. The fix is to set `Runspace.PrimaryRunspace` after the default Runspace has been opened.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Change is not breaking](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` to the beginning of the title and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] User-facing [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] Issue filed - Issue link:\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n        - [ ] [Add `[feature]` if the change is significant or affects feature tests](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/testing-guidelines/testing-guidelines.md#requesting-additional-tests-for-a-pr)\r\n",
