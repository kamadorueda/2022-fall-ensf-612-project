  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nWe all know the code constructs like this:\r\n```Powershell\r\n$Temp = $ErrorActionPreference\r\n$ErrorActionPreference = \"stop\"\r\n(Doing Stuff)\r\n$ErrorActionPreference = $Temp\r\n```\r\nWith any of the many available preference variables. When \"Doing Stuff\" is only calling one cmdlet, this can easily be simplified using the `-ErrorAction \"silentlycontinue\"` parameter, but when you need to set it for multiple calls and some in-between lines of code, that can get very annoying and confusing.\r\n\r\nWhen working with locations, you could use `Push-Location` and `Pop-Location` to make your code very concise and easy to read. Something similar for preference variables would simplify code snippets like the example above a lot.\n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\nSince preference variables are mutable enums, I don't think for example `$ErrorActionPreference.Push(\"stop\")` would work, instead cmdlets like `Push-ErrorActionPreference \"stop\"` similar to locations would need to be made.\r\n\r\nAlso some thought would need to be put into how this would work in conjunction with the common parameter `-ErrorAction`, for example that every time the parameter is explicitly specified, it gets pushed, and on end of the cmdlet, it is popped.",

      "body": "The Engine WG discussed this yesterday and concluded that scopes already provide a easy syntax for push/pop semantics. For instance:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$ErrorActionPreference = 'Break'\r\n& { \r\n    $ErrorActionPreference = 'SilentlyContinue'\r\n    Get-ChildItem doesnotexist\r\n}\r\n\r\n# ErrorActionPreference will be back to Break and a breakpoint will be hit below\r\nGet-ChildItem doesnotexist\r\n```",
