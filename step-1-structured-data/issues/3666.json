  "body": "This is similar to #3414, but involves only the backslash portion.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the problem is premature normalization of paths. Path normalization happens quite early (and *very* frequently and in a great number of places in the PowerShell code) while processing a command. Usually this happens before the path reaches its provider, and often that normalization is a brute-force change one slash to another mechanism. Thus a path such as `1\\2` on Unix is \"normalized\" to `1/2`, ensuring that the path will never be found.\r\n\r\nUsing `-LiteralPath` does not prevent the path normalization, so that is not a workaround.\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce\r\n------------------\r\nFrom bash:\r\n```bash\r\n$ touch 'a\\b'\r\n```\r\nthen from PowerShell:\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS> Remove-Item a\\b\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```PowerShell\r\nPS> Move-Item a\\b a-b\r\n```\r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n-----------------\r\nThe file `a\\b` is deleted\r\n\r\nActual behavior\r\n---------------\r\n```\r\nRemove-Item : Cannot find path 'a/b' because it does not exist.\r\nAt line:1 char:1\r\n+ Remove-Item a\\b\r\n+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (a/b:String) \r\n    [Remove-Item], ItemNotFoundException\r\n    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : PathNotFound,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.RemoveItemCommand\r\n```\r\n\r\nEnvironment data\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value                                                     \r\n----                           -----                                                     \r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0                                                   \r\nCLRVersion                                                                               \r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.18-38-g08e855556cff42274a5903799b826e78d0c...\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}                                   \r\nPSEdition                      Core                                                      \r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3                                                       \r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha                                               \r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1                                                   \r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0                                                       \r\n```\r\n",

It may turn out to be related to path normalization, but I still think it should have it's own issue.\r\n\r\nThis one is about attempting to rename, remove or move an *existing* file. The error message in this case is `Cannot find path '1\\2' because it does not exist.` rather than `Could not find a part of the path 'C:\\temp\\1\\2'`.\r\n\r\nI think you'd be unlikely to run into this in Windows, at least on its native file systems, since both forward and backslashes are disallowed. In Unix forward slashes are allowed, and it's simple create, from bash or other programs, a file with forward slashed in the name.",

One problem is that I haven't found a way to definitively identify an NTFS file system under Linux.\r\n\r\nRegarding `[System.IO.Path]::GetInvalidPathChars()` and `[System.IO.Path]::GetInvalidFileNameChars()`, there appear to be separate implementations for each *platform* in coreclr.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the notion of illegal characters is largely platform-based rather than file system based. As an experiment, I created a file named `a>b<c:?|` on an NTFS volume on my Linux box with the `touch` command. There are five characters in there that Windows considers to be illegal, but the NTFS file system accepts them and Windows displays the file properly in Windows Explorer. I can't *do* anything with it on Windows, such open or delete it, but it is recognized.",
