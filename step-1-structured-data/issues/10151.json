On older versions of PowerShell Core, the collection is still enumerated even with use of this switch. The behavior in PowerShell Core 6.2 is consistent with Windows PowerShell.\r\n\r\nIs unclear/incorrect, especially in the last line which states **\"The behavior in PowerShell Core 6.2 is consistent with Windows PowerShell\"**, this is obviously not always the case. In the example below, the output in PowerShell Core (6.2) clearly differs from Windows PowerShell:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFunction Test {Write-Output -InputObject (,'Foo') -NoEnumerate} \r\n(Test) -is [Array]\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee also: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56995638/write-output-inputobject-test-noenumerate\r\n\r\nSee related issues: #5122, #7081, #6451 and #8124.",
