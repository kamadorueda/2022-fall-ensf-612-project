  "body": "I am logging this as a bug and not as an enhancement request because in the eyes of a tool builder, this appears to be a bug (or at the very least, a design flaw). The warning that is produced upon import of a module that contains a command with an unapproved verb is for nobody other than the author of that module, yet scripters are the ones who are presented with that message. This poses several problems:\r\n\r\n1. It confuses scripters who don't realize that message is not meant for them unless they also created the module.\r\n1. It pushes work on toolbuilders to silence this warning if they happen to be using PowerShell behind the scenes and modules they use (that often are beyond their control) happen to cause this warning.\r\n\r\nThe message that is being conveyed is of good intent, but it is directed at the wrong audience entirely, and it should never have been written as a warning for all to see (warnings are meant to convey useful information to the scripter that they may be doing something wrong). For that reason, the message should be removed entirely from `Import-Module` and `Import-PSSession`. The `-DisableNameChecking` parameter can be kept around for compatibility reasons, but it should simply be ignored. PSScriptAnalyzer is a much more appropriate technology to be used to convey this information to the author of a command.\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nnmo -name Example {\r\n    function Create-Something {[CmdletBinding()]param(); Write-Verbose 'This could create something big!'}\r\n} | ipmo\r\n```\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe module would import, without any messages sent to the console.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe module imports, sending the following output to the console:\r\n\r\n```none\r\nWARNING: The names of some imported commands from the module 'Example' include unapproved verbs that might make them\r\nless discoverable. To find the commands with unapproved verbs, run the Import-Module command again with the Verbose\r\nparameter. For a list of approved verbs, type Get-Verb.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@SteveL-MSFT: Based on that reply, I'm not sure you understand the pain point. In unattended scripts, logs are important, and warnings and error messages are the most important messages within those logs. If anything is to be displayed in PowerShell as a warning, it should be a result of some significant impact. Some examples:\r\n\r\n* you invoked a command to retrieve users, and you were sent back 1000 users, but there are more users to retrieve, so warn the user that they may not be seeing all records because the command was not invoked to retrieve all records\r\n* you invoked a REST endpoint and your call was redirected, so warn the user about the redirection\r\n\r\nMessages indicating that some cmdlets (that you might care less about -- you're running unattended scripts) come with unapproved verbs does not constitute significant impact when it comes to scripting.\r\n\r\nIt seems you are looking at this through the eyes of an interactive scripting session, where it could be useful to notify users about cmdlets that use non-standard verbs, so that they are more discoverable. `Write-Host` seems appropriate for this, because it's 100% directed towards interactive PowerShell use where you can get a message in your host to tell you about the cmdlets that are not consistent with PowerShell verb recommendations.\r\n\r\nIf the message must stay, my strong recommendation would be twofold:\r\n1. Update the message to call out the specific cmdlets that are using non-standard verbs.\r\n1. Change the target of the message by making it write directly to the host so that it does not pollute any streams. And by this I mean `$host.UI.Write`, not `Write-Host` (that is now written to an information stream). Since this message is only relevant for interactive use, it has no bearing in log files, transcripts, etc., and should never appear in any of them.",

I'd be very annoyed if it was called `Delete-MpDefinitionPackage`.\r\n\r\nImagine you don't import your module (because most folks don't...they just invoke commands), and you invoke `Get-MpDefinitionPackage`, and upon doing so you are presented with a warning (or possibly multiple warnings) about cmdlets that you didn't invoke and weren't going to invoke. Those warnings have absolutely nothing to do with your work, and are irrelevant to you.\r\n\r\nNow scale that up to a module containing 100 cmdlets, with only one that uses in incorrect verb. 99 cmdlet invocations could work just fine yet produce a warning for one cmdlet that is an outlier.\r\n\r\nNow consider someone not very well experienced with PowerShell, and when they invoke a cmdlet they get a warning. Not an informational message. A warning. Think about event logs, and how warning, error, and critical messages are usually the ones most relevant to a problem when you are looking at log file. When diagnosing issues after the fact, how does a warning telling you that a cmdlet author made a poor decision when it came to naming a small percentage of their cmdlets, which likely have nothing to do with what you were doing.\r\n\r\nOf course, I do recognize that the information presented in this message _may_ be useful to some folks. But the signal to noise on this message is by far closer to being noise than signal the majority of times that it occurs (especially since once you see it once or twice, it isn't ever necessary to see it again), and having it classified as a warning message is overstepping in this case.\r\n\r\nRegardless, I respect that you disagree @skycommand.",

Regardless, you're pushback seems to be about interactive PowerShell use. I'm not using PowerShell interactively here. In fact, the fact that PowerShell is being used at all is irrelevant to the end user. But warnings and error messages are, or should be, important, because they highlight problems, especially when running scripts unattended when you are reviewing logs. With this functionality implemented the way it is today, the warning is always generated, even in scenarios where it has no place whatsoever, where you do want warnings _about the actual code being executed, not about insignificant command naming that means nothing to someone reviewing a message log_. I have had to make a significant technical investment to silence these warnings in my product, so I logged this issue because that investment should not have been necessary, and it would be better for the PowerShell community if these warnings were only presented during interactive sessions, if at all. I stand by the opinion that this message is misdirected: it should be for the author), and there are far better ways to communicate such a message. See https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13637#issuecomment-694260675.\r\n\r\nIf you had asked questions about this instead of pushing back without understanding why I logged this issue in the first place, we could have a productive discussion about the problem. Instead, your communication makes you come across as a gatekeeper getting in the way of something that truly does need improvement.",

If we did not have some mechanism like this, I think it would be a very different world, naming-wise. Maybe we wouldn't actually mind so much... but personally I do find it really nice that I am able to infer command names based on previously-seen nouns and stuff like that. I don't think a PSScriptAnalyzer solution would have even close to the same strength as the current name warning... I don't think I've personally ever run PSScriptAnalyzer. (Not that I think it's bad... I just got started in Powershell before that was a thing, and so I have entrenched habits.)\r\n\r\nAll that said, I am not opposed to your suggestion to refine the existing mechanism to improve the warning, and I think your idea to get the warning out of logged output has merit and should be considered.

The latest Exchange module actually suppresses this warning, completely and quietly bypassing the original intent of having this warning in the first place. In their script module, which makes a connection to Exchange and imports cmdlets from that remote session, they explicitly use `-DisableNameChecking` internally, so no matter how much anyone might like to be aware that they are exporting commands with non-approved verbs (they have commands with the verbs `Delete`, `Preview`, `Release`, `Rotate`, `Troubleshoot`, `Upgrade` and `Validate`), they're just quietly hiding that detail and avoiding the public shaming that this warning was intended to call out, and there's nothing really stopping others from designing modules that do the same.\r\n\r\nThis is a clear failure. Instead of learning from the warning, renaming commands and using aliases for backwards compatibility with other names that they feel they really need to have, they add logic to suppress the warning. Great to see partner teams getting along and playing nice with one another.",
