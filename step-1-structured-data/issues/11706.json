Latest Powershell 7.0.0-rc.2 (1/16/2020) from 64-bit MSI installer.\r\n\r\n![Capture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5816420/73296762-54d1d300-41d8-11ea-9a30-77729f1424bb.JPG)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the v5 PowerShell auto-completes and runs it just fine. Also, Install-Module auto-completes it in v7.\r\n\r\nI tried...\r\n- Disabling all 3 experimental features I had enabled.\r\n- Installing and testing with rc2 & rc1 versions (both MSI installer bit versions) on Windows Insider build 18975.1000 laptop.\r\n- Using rc2 32-bit ZIP version on desktop PC.\r\n- Rebooting both PCs & between installations.\r\n- Installing and testing v6.2.4 (01/27/2020) 64-bit.\r\n... with no change.\r\n\r\nI've tried to rule out any issues on my end but let me know if I am just plain missing something or if it's working for you all. Willing to do further troubleshooting at any time.\r\n\r\nEdit: Added last \"I tried\" item. Added \"... with no change.\"",

Took a look at the Windows code, it seems that it may have used private APIs in the past (and also WMI), but a quick search shows that the API is documented.  The WMI calls could be converted to CIM API calls.  Seems like it may be possible to bring it back.",
