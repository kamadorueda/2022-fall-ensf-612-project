Run `powershell` on the local NanoServer VM\n## Expected behavior\n\nIt should start a local interactive powershell session\n## Actual behavior\n\nFail to start\n## Root Cause\n\nIt's hard coded for native hosts in NanoServer to load AssemblyLoadContext 3.0.0.0, but the one from PowerShell Core from GitHub repo is 1.0.0.0\n",
