  "body": "When writing scripts that have potentially clashing Cmdlet/function/alias names it is recommended to use the Full Module-Qualified name like below\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nMicrosoft.PowerShell.Core\\ForEach-Object\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhilst this is an extremely useful feature, this has an issue with it only working with either the currently loaded version or the latest version of the module specifiec and as such this is perhaps a lingering aspect of the language that was never updated when v5 came out which supported Side by Side versions\r\n\r\nTherefore I think it would be great if the following syntax would be able to be accepted and correctly parsed \r\n\r\n``` powershell\r\nPowerShellGet:1.6.0\\Find-Module\r\n```\r\nThis breaks down to\r\n```\r\n<moduleName>:<moduleVersion>\\<CommandName>\r\n```\r\nThe potential although limited use case for this is within scripts that have dependencies on modules that have interesting & weird differences between module versions\r\n\r\nYou can already load multiple versions of a module into the same session so this would enable script/module authors another method for diagnosing accidental breaking changes in a more typical side by side manner within the same session",

      "body": "PowerShellGet is a bad example to use but if you had pinned versions in the PSD1 you could get round this with some not great coding like this \r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nImport-Module PowerShellGet -RequiredVersion 1.0.0.1 -prefix oldPSGet\r\nImport-Module PowerShellGet\r\nInstall-oldPSGetModule \r\nInstall-Module\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem would be then the 1.0.0.1 would be calling the latest version of PackageManagement not the one required by that version, which affects many other modules as well.\r\n\r\nHaving this built in with a simpler syntax like `<moduleName>:<moduleVersion>\\<CommandName>` would help in defensive coding strategies where you really want to be explicit of what you are running but would allow for side by side module version use especially thinking Major Version module changes.",

      "body": "As Fred on the PS Community call mentioned (I think @FriedrichWeinmann ) pointed out you could even drop into the older module and call it like so\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n$oldPSGet= Get-Module PowerShellGet | Where Version -Match 2.2.4\r\n& $oldPSGet { Find-Module Ise_cew }\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nthough this isn't well known and would only really work for defensive coding if Nested Modules were used instead of global session modules\r\n\r\nEdit - this would also be viable for using v3 and v2 of PowerShellGet in side by side mode but breaks using the simpler `PowerShellGet\\Find-Module` syntax that many know and is easier to read",
