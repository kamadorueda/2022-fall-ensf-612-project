Setup TMUX with split pane in WSL (debian) on Windows 10.\r\n2. Run pwsh in one of the split pane\r\n3. Run\r\n```powershell\r\n$tt = cat ./adept-transform-excluded-1-2019-03-15-14-30-18-3c343d77-2a4e-4816-8510-6610e9f35325 | ForEach-Object {$_ | ConvertFrom-Json}     # where the file contains about 5000 json docs, where each doc has a 'message' string property which contains escaped JSON doc\r\n$ttt = $tt.message | ForEach-Object {$_ | ConvertFrom-Json}\r\n$ttt # starts writing a lot of text to screen\r\n```\r\n4. Hit [Ctrl - C] trying to stop the output.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\nIt goes back pwsh prompt\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\nIt hangs. Have to kill pwsh process \r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.1.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.1.3\r\nOS                             Linux 4.4.0-17763-Microsoft #379-Microsoft Wed Mar 06 19:16:00 PST 2019\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Sample JSON doc (with confidential info deleted)\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\"message\": \"{\\\"remote_addr\\\": \\\"x.x.x.x\\\", \\\"body\\\": {\\\"query\\\": \\\"serum\\\", \\\"size\\\": \\\"1\\\"}, \\\"headers\\\": {\\\"X-REAL-IP\\\": \\\"x.x.x.x\\\", \\\"CONNECTION\\\": \\\"upgrade\\\", \\\"HOST\\\": \\\"x.x.x.x\\\", \\\"CONTENT-LENGTH\\\": \\\"31\\\", \\\"CONTENT-TYPE\\\": \\\"application/json\\\", \\\"ACCEPT\\\": \\\"*/*\\\", \\\"ACCEPT-ENCODING\\\": \\\"gzip, deflate\\\", \\\"USER-AGENT\\\": \\\"Python/3.6 aiohttp/3.5.1\\\", \\\"X-CLOUD-TRACE-CONTEXT\\\": \\\"6d991cb1200242818619a6a082535c5d/1962556942779393608\\\", \\\"VIA\\\": \\\"1.1 google\\\", \\\"X-FORWARDED-FOR\\\": \\\"x.x.x.x, x.x.x.x\\\", \\\"X-FORWARDED-PROTO\\\": \\\"https\\\"}}\", \"service_metadata\": {\"created_at\": 1551306683.69, \"username\": \"ubuntu\", \"pid\": 24960, \"ppid\": 24957, \"cwd\": \"/home/ubuntu/adept-search\", \"name\": \"gunicorn\", \"uids\": [1000, 1000, 1000], \"cpu_info\": {\"user_time\": 0.52, \"system_time\": 0.25, \"percent\": 0.0}, \"memory_info\": {\"rss\": 65994752}, \"connections\": [[\"0.0.0.0\", \"4000\"]]}, \"id\": \"c69a1240-ca5c-43c0-aa96-ba146eed49e7\"}\r\n```",

If you remove WSL from the equation and it does't repro, then you probably need to open an issue here https://github.com/Microsoft/WSL.  If it repros with pwsh outside of WSL, we can certainly take a look.",
