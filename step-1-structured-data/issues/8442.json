      "body": "@kborowinski, repair not working \u2026  one time gave 'account already exists', and another time, I have dialog now waiting for me to relocate the missing install package.\r\n\r\nSo I have a hunch on why this may have affected me.  I installed the MSI package directly from the website without saving the download, so the dialog is looking for the install package in Edge's temporary download folder.\r\n\r\nSo now I have redownloaded and saved it \u2026 (that MSI file wouldn't repair it) \u2026 uninstalled it and then reinstalled and all is fine.   \r\n\r\nLooking back through things, this is the first time I have installed the preview without saving it first.  However, it appears that I did a straight run of the current released version without any difficulty.",
