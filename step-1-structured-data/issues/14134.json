  "body": "When the `Nullable<T>.HasValue` check is necesary, we should keep using `Nullable<T>.Value` after the check. Comparing to `Nullable<T>.GetValueOrDefault()`, it's semantically more clear that \"I want the current value, not the default value\" in this case.\r\n\r\nTherefore, revert PR #13804 as agreed in https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/13791#issuecomment-729049790\r\n\r\n",
