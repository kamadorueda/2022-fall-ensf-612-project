  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a question about powershell core in the docker container or in the azure webapp.\r\nI develop some webjob(.net core app) that tries to execute powershell commands using the Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Diagnostics, Microsoft.PowerShell.SDK, Microsoft.WSMan.Management packages(version 6.2.0).\r\nIn my local environment(I've installed powershell 6 and I have powershell 5 as default) the webjob works correct without any issues. Then I try to deploy the webjob in the linux docker container. The dockerfile has some instruction for installing powershell core 6.2.0 in the container. So, docker container(OS Debian 9) with my webjob runs with installed powershell core. Then my code tries to execute the following command:\r\n```\r\nusing (PowerShell ps = PowerShell.Create())\r\n{\r\n   ps.AddScript(\"Get-PackageProvider -ListAvailable\");\r\n   var results = ps.Invoke();\r\n}\r\n```\r\nand after that I get the following error:\r\n\r\n> Unhandled Exception: System.AggregateException: One or more errors occurred. (The term 'Get-PackageProvider' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\n> Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.) ---> System.Management.Automation.CommandNotFoundException: The term 'Get-PackageProvider' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.\r\n> Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.CommandDiscovery.LookupCommandInfo(String commandName, CommandTypes commandTypes, SearchResolutionOptions searchResolutionOptions, CommandOrigin commandOrigin, ExecutionContext context)\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.CommandDiscovery.LookupCommandInfo(String commandName, CommandOrigin commandOrigin, ExecutionContext context)\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.CommandDiscovery.LookupCommandInfo(String commandName, CommandOrigin commandOrigin)\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.CommandDiscovery.LookupCommandProcessor(String commandName, CommandOrigin commandOrigin, Nullable`1 useLocalScope)\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.ExecutionContext.CreateCommand(String command, Boolean dotSource)\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.PipelineOps.AddCommand(PipelineProcessor pipe, CommandParameterInternal[] commandElements, CommandBaseAst commandBaseAst, CommandRedirection[] redirections, ExecutionContext context)\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.PipelineOps.InvokePipeline(Object input, Boolean ignoreInput, CommandParameterInternal[][] pipeElements, CommandBaseAst[] pipeElementAsts, CommandRedirection[][] commandRedirections, FunctionContext funcContext)\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.Interpreter.ActionCallInstruction`6.Run(InterpretedFrame frame)\r\n> at System.Management.Automation.Interpreter.EnterTryCatchFinallyInstruction.Run(InterpretedFrame frame)\r\n> --- End of inner exception stack trace ---\r\n\r\nThe same issue I have in azure. When I run webjob I get that error.\r\nI've already googled a lot of sources and tried a lot of different solutions but any of them didn't help me.\r\nCould you help me, please?\r\nWhy this issue isn't reproduce in my local environment but only in azure and container?\r\n\r\nThanks!",

      "body": "@antondats The informations you need to understand the whole chain :\r\n\r\nThe error said \"Get-PackageProvider\" not found.\r\n\r\nGet-PackageProvider is a command from module packagemanagement [get-packageprovider](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/packagemanagement/get-packageprovider?view=powershell-6)\r\n\r\nThe environment variable that declare module path : [Modifying the PSModulePath Installation Path](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/developer/module/modifying-the-psmodulepath-installation-path)\r\n\r\nThere is preference variable that configure PSModule Autoloading [PSModuleAutoloadingPreference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_preference_variables?view=powershell-6#psmoduleautoloadingpreference)\r\n\r\nThis is the command for import module [Import-Module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/import-module?view=powershell-6)\r\n\r\nI advice you to verify where is packagemanagement module,if it's in the env:PSModulePath, verify PSModuleAutoloadingPreference, and use Import-Module.\r\n\r\nPS : it's a community response to help you quickly but it's not a problem in this repository",

      "body": "@fmichaleczek Thanks for the answer) \r\nBut in docker container there is PSModulePath with valid data about path to the packagemanagement module. And when I connect to container I can execute \"Get-PackageProvider\" command without any errors but when command is executed from the code in my webjob, I get an error. \r\nSo, I thing problem is with powerhell packages. It seems that these packages can't run powershell core in the docker container. (the same issue there is azure webjob)\r\n\r\nPS: I've also posted this issue to the powershell community but I've not received the answer yet ",
