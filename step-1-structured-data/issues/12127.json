      "body": "PowerShell is, in effect, a great replacement for CMD.EXE in Windows. \r\n\r\nRegarding memory management, Windows does this internally. No need for a 3rd party add-on. You can use PowerShell to retrieve memory counters (either Get-Counter or using WMI)\r\n\r\nFinally, the project you refer to is nothing to do with PowerShell.\r\n\r\nI suspect this report can be closed.\r\n",
