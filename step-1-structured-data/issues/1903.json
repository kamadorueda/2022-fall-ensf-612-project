So powershell being accepted into debian now would have meant next ubuntu LTS to be released in 2018 april (which will be supported for next five years) will also have powershell in its official repositories. Which means powershell will have greater chance to move into official workflows of organizations next year itself, because of it being in \"official\" repos of linux distributions themselves. \r\n\r\nBut still i am happy that even if powershell 6.1.0 also brings it into debian official repo, still i will eagerly wait, so that i can bring it into offical workflow choice of my organization  (as anything hosted on third party repo is strictly denied here ).\r\n\r\nPowershell 6.1 coming in debian repo means it will be available in debian \"stable\" official repo in 2019 release or in ubuntu 20.04 LTS release (in year 2020), as companies only work with stable or LTS versions. Using powershell in linux professional workflow in 2019 or 2020, just due to above one small decision of yours, will make powershell far too distant in future for enterprise adoption",
