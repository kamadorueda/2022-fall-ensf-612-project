  "body": "`Get-Content /etc/os-release` returns an array of strings, which get feeded to `ConvertFrom-StringData`. Therefore, `$LinuxInfo` is actually an array of Hashtable instances before this change. Property access on `$LinuxInfo` like `$LinuxInfo.ID` happens to work because powershell supports accessing a property or calling a method on a collection of object, but it's inefficient.\r\nAfter this fix, `$LinuxInfo` will be a Hashtable, and it's efficient to access its members.\r\n",
