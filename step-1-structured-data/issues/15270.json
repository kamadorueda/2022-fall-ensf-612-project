      "body": "Perhaps surprisingly, this is not how `-Exclude` works: it does _not_ exclude entire directory _subtrees_.\r\n\r\nInstead, the exclusion pattern is applied _at every level of the subtree hierarchy_.\r\n\r\n`-Exclude out` therefore means that while directories named `out` are _themselves_ omitted from the output (as `[System.IO.DirectoryInfo]` instances), _their contents_ are not (unless items there also match the pattern).\r\n\r\n#15159  suggests adding a _new parameter_ for subtree exclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
