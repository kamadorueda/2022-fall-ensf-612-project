Please add a test that the content behind that URI contains online help for that command (not an error and not any bogus irrelevant stuff).\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\n1. `Invoke-WebRequest` on the URI.\r\n2. If request failed, skip test.\r\n3. Assert that the request status is OK.\r\n4. Assert that the retrieved content contains the command name.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
