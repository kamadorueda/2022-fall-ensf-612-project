  "body": "I don\u2019t know if it's a bug or not, but I was able to write a PowerShell script that consumed all available CPU time and memory.\r\n\r\nWhen I ran the script my mouse pointer got slower and slower and eventually completely stopped. Both mouse and keyboard became unresponsive and the only thing a could do was pressing the reset button.\r\n\r\nI suspect that it happened when the script\u2019s internal string (one of its variables) got about 1.5 Gb in size.\r\n",

      "body": "The key thing with strings is that they are, fundamentally, immutable. .NET does not allow you to modify a string. All string \"modification\" operations involve copying portions of or the entire original string, and then saving the new string to a new memory address.\r\n\r\nSo if you're doing repeated operations on very large strings, it's certainly possible to end up consuming all available resources. Strings aren't designed for that kind of operation to happen repeatedly with enormous strings.\r\n\r\nThis isn't really a PowerShell problem, it stems from .NET itself. But really, it's probably moreso that you're trying to use tools that weren't designed for the kinds of operations you're trying to do.\r\n\r\nIf you need to manipulate that much data in detail you're probably better off managing the strings as `[char[]]` arrays, being careful to allocate enough space to do what you need from the beginning. There is also the option of [StringBuilder](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder?view=net-5.0) which is much more efficient for building strings without excessive allocation.\r\n\r\nThe tool you should use depends on exactly what you're needing to do, though.",
