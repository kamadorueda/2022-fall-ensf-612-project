Path normalization happens quite early (and *very* frequently and in a great number of places in the PowerShell code) while processing a command. Usually this happens before the path reaches its provider, and often that normalization is a brute-force change one slash to another mechanism. Thus a path such as `1\\2` on Unix is \"normalized\" to `1/2`, ensuring that the path will never be found.\r\n\r\nUsing `-LiteralPath` does not prevent the path normalization, so that is not a workaround.",
