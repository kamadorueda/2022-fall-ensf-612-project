  "body": "#3267 originally proposed the idea of exposing a `-Charset` or `-ResponseCharset` parameter but an alternate solution of implementing basic charset parsing from meta tags was chosen. This will not always help and to address edge cases the ability to have a user supplied encoding used for decoding the response stream is still \"nice to have\".\r\n\r\nI am creating a separate issue to discuss and track this. As far as I can tell, this is somewhat trivial to implement. \r\n\r\nThe design of this is that, when supplied, all aotudetection of charset is bypassed and the user supplied encoding will be used instead. This means that even if the remote endpoint supplies a charset it will be ignored in favor of the user's supplied encoding.  This is helpful in situations where an endpoint is reporting and incorrect encoding for whatever reason.",
