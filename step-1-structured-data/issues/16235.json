  "body": "### Summary of the new feature / enhancement\n\nOur current release process is that we upload the new version of our PowerShell modules to the PowerShell gallery a few days before the GA date to test that everything uploads correctly. Then we try to download them from the gallery and import them to check that everything works fine and then we unlist them until the GA date. The problem is that with the number of modules getting bigger and bigger this manual updating of 50+ modules (with the perspective to become even more than this) becomes a serious bottleneck in this process. That's why we need an automated way to hide/unhide modules. \n\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\n\n_No response_",
