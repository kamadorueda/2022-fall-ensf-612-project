The Cmdet working group has agreed that a new cmdlet called `Get-TranscriptStatus` should be developed.\r\n\r\n### Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nThe cmdlet should be scope and user-specific only. It should indicate if transcription is currently running and to what file. For security purposes the cmdlet should only return information for the current user.",
