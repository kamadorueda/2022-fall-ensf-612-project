  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\n\r\nIn #16593 I said there is a need for invariance with dates - meaning changing culture doesn't change the meaning of  [datetime]\"12/10/2021\".   With times  `[datetime]::new` allows code to create a date using **invariant time** (UTC) so that wherever this is run\r\n``` \r\n [datetime]::new(2022,06,30,12,0,0,[System.DateTimeKind]::Utc)\r\n````\r\nIt returns `30 June 2022 12:00:00  Z`, which can be convert to a local time if needed. \r\n\r\n`Get-Date `  **Always** treats the values as **local** so      \r\n`(Get-Date -Year 2022 -Month 6 -Day 30 -Hour 12 -Minute 0 -Second 0).ToUniversalTime()`   \r\non UK time Produces \r\n`30 June 2022 11:00:00`\r\nand on pacific time produces\r\n30 June 2022 19:00:00\r\n\r\nThe **-AsUTC** switch does not mean \"These values describe a UTC time\", but \"These are local times but please the resulting  time in UTC\"   so \r\n```\r\n(Get-Date -Year 2022 -Month 6 -Day 30 -Hour 12 -Minute 0 -Second 0 -AsUTC )\r\n```\r\nis the same as the previous result. \r\n\r\n\r\nChanging the meaning of -AsUTC would be a breaking change so a new switch , perhaps \"-Kind\" taking a  `[System.DateTimeKind]` would be better \n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nGet-Date -Year 2022 -Month 6 -Day 30 -Hour 12 -Minute 0 -Second 0 -AsUTC\r\n\r\nTreats the times parameters as UTC times.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nGet-Date -Year 2022 -Month 6 -Day 30 -Hour 12 -Minute 0 -Second 0 -AsUTC\r\n\r\nTreats the times parameters as local times and transforms the result into a UTC time. (i.e. This is 12 Noon local, and outputs 11AM UTC , not 12Noon UTC, a.k.a. 1PM local).\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u0393\u00c7\u00aa}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

Invariant means my code does the same thing regardless of where I run it.     \r\nBut `-as [datetime]`  does it the other way round. \r\n```\r\n> \"1/12/2021\" -as [datetime]\r\n\r\n01 December 2021 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nIf you know why they're different  you're doing better than I am :-)  \r\n\r\nSo what happens if I put `[datetime]$ParameterName` in a function? \r\n```\r\nfunction test {param ([datetime]$d)  $d}\r\n\r\n> test 1/12/2021\r\n12 January 2021 00:00:00\r\n```\r\nWritten that way I'd expect culture invariant, which is what I get.   \r\nSo let's have a look at Get-Date's parameters : \r\n```\r\n (get-command Get-Date).parameters['Date']\r\n\r\nName            : Date\r\nParameterType   : System.DateTime\r\n```\r\nSo `Get-Date` also declares a `[datetime]` Parameter, so shouldn't that be invariant ? Nope, it uses local culture. \r\n```\r\n> get-date -date 1/12/2021\r\n\r\n01 December 2021 00:00:00\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo if you use Get-Date on a server where  you don't know what culture and timezone are set \r\n```\r\n> get-date -date 1/12/21 -hour 12 -minute 0 -second 0 \r\n```\r\ncan mean one of three dates, and noon in any time zone. \r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "body": "I'm going to close this. @iSazonov  I think there is a \"By Design\" tag you can add. \r\n\r\n1. `Get-Date` always works from _local_ time, using either `[datetime]::now` which is the localize time or the `-Date` or  `-UnixTimeSeconds`  parameter converted to a local `[datetime]`\r\n2.  If `-year`, `-month`, `-day`, `hour`, and/or `-minute`  are given they replace just that value part of the local time.\r\n3. `-AsUTC`  is applied at the end.  So  `Get-Date  -Month 6 -Hour 2 -AsUTC`   keeps year, day, minutes, seconds and fractions of the seconds and changes the month to June (DST in the Northern Hemisphere) and the hour to 2AM and then converts to UTC.  Writing it as  `get-date -asutc  -month 6 -hour 2 ` of course produces the same result, but might suggest to the reader that we have changed the UTC hour. \r\n4. To reliably build a UTC time one should use `[datetime]::new()` and specify the kind as universal. To show the time for a different time zone one should use `[timezoneinfo]ConvertTimeBySystemTimeZoneId`\r\n5. As a compiled cmdlet a `DateTime` parameter passed to Get-Date (`-date`) is converted using local culture settings. PowerShell handles compiled cmdlets and functions differently the conversion for Functions always uses invariant culture. The conversion of some types (including datetime) for compiled code uses local culture. It is a bug but fixing it would break too much existing code. \r\n\r\nI'll take my documentation thoughts for Get-Date to the proper place. \r\n\r\n",
