  "body": "Invoke-WebRequest should allow body content on DELETE, and perhaps any verb. \r\n\r\nWhenever I run into an API that accepts data on DELETE, I am hamstrung by the client-side enforcement of which verbs can send a body and which cannot. For example, posting data on DELETE is used by many applications such as tumblr/collins to log reasons server-side. This may or may not be a good use of verbs and APIs, but I can't fix the server. I'm required to reimplement Invoke-WebRequest around System.Net.HttpWebRequest::CreateHttp to get the request in the shape that I need. Allowing the user to send a body with any verb is going to allow some needed flexibility in our world of varying APIs. Having a request fail because Invoke-WebRequest can only query perfect APIs will keep people from using it. Curl is a good example of how an API consumer should be less opinionated because it's a part of an imperfect world. With curl, if I construct an HTTP request that follows the core of HTTP but mismatches verbs, content, headers, etc, that's really my prerogative. If the goal for PowerShell 6.0 is to be amazing in the cloud, it has to be amazing in some rainier clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs far as HTTP standards, body content on DELETE has some discussion here:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/299628/is-an-entity-body-allowed-for-an-http-delete-request \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your time. I love love PowerShell.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n> $PSVersionTable\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-beta\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\r\nCLRVersion\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-beta.1\r\nOS                             Darwin 16.5.0 Darwin Kernel Version 16.5.0: Fri Mar  3 16:52:33 PST 2017; root:xnu-3789.51.2~3/RELEASE_X86_64\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```",
