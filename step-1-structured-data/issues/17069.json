  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nI wrote bug #16960 a couple of weeks ago.  Someone prematurely added the \"answered\" label and the bug was auto-closed.  But it's clear from the conversation in the bug that the behavior is *not* as expected and it should still be an open bug.  I didn't see any way to remove the \"answered\" label or re-open the bug.  So I'm creating this issue instead.  Is it possible to re-open the bug?  Or should I just create a new identical issue?\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nn/a\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
