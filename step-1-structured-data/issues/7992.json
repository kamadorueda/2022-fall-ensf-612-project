  "body": "PR #7661 added  [package.tests.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/test/common/package/package.tests.ps1), to check that all referenced packages are of the latest version. This causes a lot of unnecessary build failures in forks and PRs because it takes time for the bot to kick in and the update to be approved and merged and then one needs to upstream or re trigger the build and hope that no other 3rd party has published a new update in the meantime...\r\nThose tests should be moved to a different build definition that is run e.g. only on a daily basis but definitely not part of CI or a PR. cc @TravisEz13 ",
