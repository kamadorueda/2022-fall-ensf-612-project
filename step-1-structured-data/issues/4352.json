I mean I do not see Richard Stallman's GNU copyright header every time the Linux Bash starts. Microsoft is trying to become more open and it worked in many areas already quite well, so get rid of your old habits in more areas ;) \r\n\r\nI know that `/nologo` helps to get rid of this corporate blob but this cannot be the only solution.\r\n",

Screen estate is previous.\r\nYou already have a `--version` option so please get rid of that, too.",
