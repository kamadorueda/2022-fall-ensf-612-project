Especially VIM bindings should work with it.\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nResult of the previous walkthrough:\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/982379/66286742-0c15a780-e8d3-11e9-8fc8-52f719e17251.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\nI am using the default PowerShell Core terminal // not Windows Terminal\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.4\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.4\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18362\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

      "body": "@kilasuit definitely not. Readline has nothing to do with it. In my example, I had VIM running which processes stdin (and does not recognize C-PageUp correctly), readline would not see it.\r\n\r\nIt may well be that VIM is at fault and just does not \"speak\" powershell special characters. That is, does not know how powershell escape characters look like for every modifier. Looking more into it, running it from cmd.exe has the same effect. It could be that my version of VIM just needs to be taught how escape sequences work under windows. Is anyone versed in this and knows where to get the exact escape sequences for modifier keys and keys like \"PageUp\"?\r\n\r\nIn sight of that I'd absolutely not mind closing this issue as not PowerShell specific, by the way.",
