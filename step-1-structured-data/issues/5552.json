  "body": "when `-NoEnumerate` is used. Fixes #5122.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR is a _compromise_ that attempts to reconcile @PetSerAl's conceptually cleaner, but abandoned #5123 with the conflicting changes in #2038.\r\n\r\n#2038 [should never have happened](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/issues/2035#issuecomment-323641345) and continues to cause problems.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, the implications of this PR are:\r\n\r\n* a single scalar input object is now also passed through when `-NoEnumerate` is specified, as is desirable\r\n   * the price to pay is that `Write-Output -NoEnumerate 1` is now indistinguishable from `Write-Output -NoEnumerate -InputObject ([System.Collections.Generic.List[object]]::new((, 1)))`\r\n\r\n* by changing the `-InputObject` parameter type from `[psobject[]` to `[object]`, _multi_-argument inputs passed without explicit use of `-InputObject`  are now passed through as a `[List[object]]` instance when using `-NoEnumerate`, which is an unfortunate side effect of how `ValueFromRemainingArguments` arguments are reported - see #4625.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
