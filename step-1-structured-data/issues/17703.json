  "body": "### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\r\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\r\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Input `$Host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal` in Windows Terminal\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS>  $Host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```console\r\nPS>  $Host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal\r\nFalse\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error details\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Environment data\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.5\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.5\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19044\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Visuals\r\n\r\n### The bug's origin\r\nI found this question using oh-my-posh, I have discussed this question in oh-my-posh community, they were sure it's not an issue of oh-my-Posh. They believed the return value of \"$Host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal\" is the key.\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe terminal returns `True`. And the terminal's appearance looks like this.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71929239/179397291-a12d9c0c-f128-4d28-9b28-9866d2a1e60d.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThe terminal outputs `False`. The terminal's appearance looks like this.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71929239/179397275-c95506e4-668a-4bda-a593-91959d555b2c.png)\r\n\r\nAnd it's weird since the \"virtual terminal processing\" (see [MS docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences)) should have been enabled by default in Windows Terminal.\r\nEven after I uninstalled oh-my-posh and reinstalled Powershell, `$Host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal` still returns `False`. But another computer's `$Host.UI.SupportsVirtualTerminal`  returns `True` at all times. ",
