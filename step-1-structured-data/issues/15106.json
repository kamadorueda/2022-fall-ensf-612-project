However, pwsh defaults to STA to support WinForms/WPF (same as Windows PowerShell).  This results in an error and unusable PowerShell runspace.  Fix is to have a check whether `-STA` is explicitly used or implicitly where `-MTA` is not specified by attempting to create a STA thread.\r\n\r\nValidated manually.\r\n\r\n## PR Context\r\n\r\nReported by internal Msft partner\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] None\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Experimental feature(s) needed](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/blob/staging/reference/6/Microsoft.PowerShell.Core/About/about_Experimental_Features.md)\r\n        - [ ] Experimental feature name(s): <!-- Experimental feature name(s) here -->\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [x] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [ ] Issue filed: <!-- Number/link of that issue here -->\r\n- **Testing - New and feature**\r\n    - [x] N/A or can only be tested interactively\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] [Make sure you've added a new test if existing tests do not effectively test the code changed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#before-submitting)\r\n- **Tooling**\r\n    - [x] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and don't believe tooling will be impacted.\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [ ] I have considered the user experience from a tooling perspective and opened an issue in the relevant tool repository.

If we do it through a series of internal logic, I feel we're just going to end up with complicated, hard-to-explain behaviour that's hard to justify for users.\r\n2. If we are determined to do it this way, why do we need to set a boolean early on?

This was a breaking change from PowerShell Core 6 (which defaulted to MTA) with PowerShell 7 and is affecting some users who don't even care about winforms/WPF.\r\n\r\nWhether STA or MTA is used is needed to be determined before we create the first runspace.  The exception occurs when the console host tries to open the runspace as that is when the thread is actually created.  I don't think it makes sense for the API to create the runspace to override STA and magically make it MTA.  Doing it in the host makes more sense to me as the user isn't explicitly requesting it (unless `-STA` is specified)",

I think the _implementation_ in this PR is now good, but I'm concerned that the actual behaviour is just a stopgap and given that this is actually a public behaviour (albeit a subtle one -- or perhaps moreso because it's subtle), we should instead look at it at a high level and have a design discussion around what makes sense from the perspective of \"what should the public contract be in the absence of prior behaviour\" rather than \"what's the shortest distance from what we have today to what works\".\r\n\r\nFor example, if we were writing the documentation for the thread mode in which PowerShell starts, I think we should prefer the behaviour that is simple, where it's straightforward both what the default is and how the configuration operates.\r\n\r\nIf, instead, the logic is \"well, on Unix it does this, and on some Windows SKUs it does that, but on other Windows SKUs it does this third thing\" then it's not logic that users can meaningfully depend on and is a weak contract; it's flaky or it may as well be. If it can't be explained in a single clause in documentation, it's probably a bad behaviour.\r\n\r\nWe need to make this behaviour well-defined and dependable, rather than trying to second guess users and have it \"just work\" by resisting user configuration. Especially when it comes to something subtle like apartment state, users should be able to categorically know that PowerShell's main runspace is STA or MTA without having to run through a flowchart, unless we have a really good reason for forcing that complexity.\r\n\r\nSo with that in mind I think we should ask for this to be reviewed by the relevant working group/subject matter experts.",

I'm pretty sure .NET Core didn't support STA initially until later when it was at \"parity\" with .NET Framework.  For PowerShell 7, we did change the default back to STA because of support for WPF/WinForms that was added to .NET Core.\r\n\r\nOnce STA or MTA is set on a thread, you can't change it.  So once the default runspace created by ConsoleHost (in this case) has set the ApartmentState, that's it.  This is why the switches exist for pwsh.exe and allow to be set if the user knows they are calling some COM API that requires one or the other to work successfully.\r\n\r\nI think the only scenario PowerShell users have encountered STA vs MTA is using winforms/WPF from script.  The cases where Windows itself doesn't support STA, the usage of PowerShell is as a console or automation and I haven't heard of any scenarios where they needed STA (or aware of the problem until they try PS7).\r\n",

The console, however, is not something most users need to think about STA vs MTA and should just start and for advanced users, they can rely on the `-sta` and `-mta` switches.",
