  "body": "## Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nThis proposal seeks to come up with a plan for getting #1995 (argv-passing) right without having to call out to the system shell. A two-step migration plan is proposed:\r\n* For powershell v7.1, we seek to make a proper `-ArgumentList` available (in the sense of escaping like `System.Diagnostics.Process` does) by adding a switch to `Start-Process` that defaults to `false`.\r\n* For powershell v7.2, we make the correct behavior the default by:\r\n  * making the new `Start-Process` switch default to `$true`\r\n  * making escaping the behavior for `&` and normal external command calls\r\n  * bumping whatever protocol version is affected\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make sure that PowerShell pass the `argv` as-is to most programs on Windows and all programs on Unix. In other words, for any given string object `$x`, the result for the two commands are expected to be the same:\r\n```powershell\r\nWrite-Output $x\r\n/bin/printf \"%s\\n\" $x\r\n```\r\n\r\nWin32 programs that use custom cmdline parsing will still be usable with the `--%` marker as well as our new switch. Unix programs always use the MSVCRT parsing rule under-the-hood in CoreFX, so they won't be negatively affected at all. For Unix, `--%` can be seen as a way to... poke at the internals.\r\n\r\nAfter all, pwsh is supposed to be a cross-platform shell, so Windows-specific idiosyncrasies should not be part of the basic interface.\r\n\r\n## Proposed technical implementation details\r\n\r\nAs some unspecified utility class, we duplicate the `PasteArguments` class from CoreFX runtime. This is needed because some  our logging code paths use `startupInfo.Arguments` already. It makes more sense to log the stuff escaped like how we invoke it than to log it wrong or using some other custom escape method.\r\n\r\nFor 7.1 and 7.2, we add a `bool? EscapeArgs` (name to be discussed) member to the `StartProcessCommand` class. This flag is to be checked in the existing `if (ArgumentList != null)` branch. When we decide that we shall escape the args according to the fallback rules in the first section, we do it ourselves using the new utility class.\r\n\r\nFor 7.2 we change `NativeCommandParameterBinder::AppendOneNativeArgument` to use the new class. (The existing code tries to do escaping, but it somehow fails. `NeedQuotes` is miserably wrong.)\r\n\r\nI don't have time to check `Invoke-Expression` and `Invoke-Command` yet. I guess they are handled by the latter change?\r\n\r\n## Examples\r\nThe change to quoting behavior mainly affects strings with embedded whitespace and double quotes. Consider the snippet below:\r\n```powershell\r\n$x = 'a\" b\" c d'\r\nnode -e \"console.log(process.argv.splice(1).join('|'))\" -- \"$x\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn current powershell, the string printed would be `a|b c d`, a result that can only be understood by one with an idea about how MSVCRT parses arguments and how we decide what to wrap quotes around for. In the proposed version, the output would be the `a\" b\" c d`, exactly as fed into the command (as `Write-Output` would show).\r\n\r\nThe linked PR, #13099, also changes how empty parameters are handled. They were previously omitted on the command-line, but now they are included correctly as empty native arguments. As a result, unassigned variables used will shift the parameter position by one. To avoid this, initalize it to an empty list.\r\n```ps1\r\n# add $cpflag = @()\r\nif ($shouldReflink) {\r\n  $cpflag = '--reflink=auto'\r\n}\r\ncp -a $cpflag $source $dest\r\n```\r\n\r\n#13099 also enables globbing on ALL bare words. As a result, constructs like ``a` b*`` is now subject to globbing. If globbing is undesired, you should be quoting the string. It is expected that few people will rely on the old behavior, as quoted strings are easier to use anyways. A separate proposal (#13098) will address the ergonomics of needing to manually backtick-escaping everything.\r\n\r\nA lot of old code is expected to rely on the old example 2 behavior, since that's how POSIX `sh` works with unquoted expansions. More complex frameworks may do its own quoting, coming into conflict with example 1. An experimental feature switch will be added that covers all three.",

My plan is that rogue programs will eventually only be served by `--%`, for which people will write modules around. It should get documented after all. There *is* the problem of being unable to pass a literal `%`, but people should be able to make up their own env var for it. `--=` is nice and shouldn't be too hard to add.\r\n\r\nI cannot think of a good interface for reusable escaping. Doing `cmd` would take either a very complicated version of the normal rules that keeps tracks of cmd's view of quoting or a non-standard one with the undocumeted `\"\"`. And top it with the usual `/c /k /s \"verbatim cmdline here\"` stuff.\r\n\r\nI kind of like the idea of preserving quoting structure, but then a bareword with trailing backslashes will always throw it off.
