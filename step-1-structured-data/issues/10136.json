  "body": "Hello, everyone! I recently meet a strange problem about double hop.\r\n\r\nI try to run the following PowerShell command\r\n```\r\n$credential = Get-Credential\r\n\r\n$computerName = \"frxp02361Dmbssh\"\r\n\r\n$psdrive1 = @{\r\n    Name = \"PSDrive1\"\r\n    PSProvider = \"FileSystem\"\r\n    Root = \"\\\\mbssh01\\Tool\"\r\n    Credential = $credential\r\n}\r\n\r\n$psdrive2 = @{\r\n    Name = \"PSDrive2\"\r\n    PSProvider = \"FileSystem\"\r\n    Root = \"\\\\dyn\\AX\"\r\n    Credential = $credential\r\n}\r\n\r\n$psdrive3 = @{\r\n    Name = \"PSDrive3\"\r\n    PSProvider = \"FileSystem\"\r\n    Root = \"\\\\scmlabe3\\SCM\"\r\n    Credential = $credential\r\n}\r\n\r\n$psdrive4 = @{\r\n    Name = \"PSDrive4\"\r\n    PSProvider = \"FileSystem\"\r\n    Root = \"\\\\codeflow\\public\"\r\n    Credential = $credential\r\n}\r\n\r\nInvoke-Command -ComputerName $computerName -ScriptBlock {\r\n     New-PSDrive @using:psdrive1\r\n     New-PSDrive @using:psdrive2\r\n     New-PSDrive @using:psdrive3\r\n     New-PSDrive @using:psdrive4\r\n}\r\n```\r\nFinally, I successfully create new PSDrives of `\\\\mbssh01\\Tool`, `\\\\scmlabe3\\SCM`, `\\\\codeflow\\public` EXCEPT FOR `\\\\dyn\\AX`\r\n\r\nI received the following error:\r\n![U4ZQLL56VUXB9G8YRPQQC)O](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39628662/61104812-37425380-a4aa-11e9-9099-b86e41e59318.png)\r\n\r\nWe can see the command `New-PSDrive @using:psdrive2` failed.\r\n\r\nBut the other three commands all succeed.\r\n\r\nI have tested that I can access the folder `\\\\dyn\\AX` in File Explorer when I login into the remote computer.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me? I will be very grateful!",
