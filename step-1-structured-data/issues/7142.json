  "body": "@TravisEz13 - Not sure if this is already on the list of fixes, but the preview package is adding itself near the beginning of the path - resulting in it being primary, rather than side by side.\r\n\r\nSince path is the only environment variable the package is setting, I think you could just condition the standard action \"WriteEnvironmentStrings\" by a special property you set in the properties table.\r\n\r\nMaybe consider making the property public so that a given installation could force it off to make preview the default pathed version?\r\n\r\nAlso, maybe force it off if no release version of the product is already on the system?  That would address the use case of a preview release being the only one on a system.",
