  "body": "On linux/OSX, certain PkgMgmt functionality such as bootstrapping, updating providers are broken because of the dependency on the following env variables:\n\n$env:APPDATA\n$env:LOCALAPPDATA\n$env:ProgramFiles\n\nThese make sense only on Windows. We need to use platform agnostic methods to manage bootstrapping.\n",
