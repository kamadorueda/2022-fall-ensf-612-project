  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nTrying to write a PowerShell stub for https://github.com/ouspg/trytls , I discovered \r\nthat PowerShell (running on MacOS 10.11.6) Invoke-Webrequests accepts some invalid \r\ncertificates. Additionally, it allows the use of RC4 cryptography, which is now considered insecure.\r\n\r\nOn Ubuntu 16.04 (after installing some libcurl dependencies), these are rejected.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/wbond/badtls.io has additional tests that I could not run, since I could not\r\nfigure out how to use a custom CA bundle, these should be investigated as well.\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nInvoke-Webrequest https://incomplete-chain.badssl.com/ should fail\r\nInvoke-Webrequest https://rc4.badssl.com/ should fail\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\nSite loads without throwing exception\r\n```\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nPSVersion                      6.0.0-alpha\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0...}\r\nBuildVersion                   3.0.0.0\r\nGitCommitId                    v6.0.0-alpha.9\r\nCLRVersion\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\n```",
