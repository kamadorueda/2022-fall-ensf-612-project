  "body": "AppVeyor builds fail due to reporting the progress of script analysis, specifically [this piece of code](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/commit/b400ba368811ac0221632457669dff5203940616#diff-8db7ab7b17a956849fe85734af72f5bbR1327). Removing the `CORECLR` guard results in this error:\n\n> The running command stopped because the preference variable \"ErrorActionPreference\" or common parameter is set to Stop: Cannot process the XML from the 'Error' stream of 'C:\\projects\\powershell\\src\\powershell-windows\\bin\\Debug\\netcoreapp1.0\\win81-x64\\publish\\powershell.exe': Data at the root level is invalid. Line 1, position 382.\n\nAs can be seen in [this build](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/PowerShell/powershell/build/0.6.0.3806).\n\n@lzybkr notes that disabling the code is not enough:\n\n> By not calling WriteProgress with a Completed message, we'll leave screen artifacts. See the corresponding call in SriptAnalysis.cs, line 43 - that code is not guarded at all by #if !CORECLR\n> \n> I don't have a strong preference on this specific progress message, but if progress messages are causing problems in CI, turning them off this way is not the right fix.\n",
