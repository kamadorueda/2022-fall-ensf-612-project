  "body": "# Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nRun `pwsh` on Debian Buster (Debian 10) and starts to type commands.\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\npwsh is usable, user can type commands and read outputs.\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a problem with the buffers. Typing commands and running them does not work after the first one. Like if the buffers get unsynchronized with the inputs/outputs of the terminal. \r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\nI reproduce this problem with a snap install of pwsh and with the tar.zf archive. \r\n\r\n```\r\nPS /opt> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      6.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    6.2.3\r\nOS                             Linux 4.19.0-6-amd64 #1 SMP Debian 4.19.67-2 (2019-08-28)\r\nPlatform                       Unix\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
