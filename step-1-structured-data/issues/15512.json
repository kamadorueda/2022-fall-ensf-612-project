  "body": "## Steps to reproduce\r\n```powershell\r\nfor ($remaining = 3.5; $remaining -gt 0; $remaining -= 0.5)\r\n{\r\n    Write-Progress -Activity \"Demonstrating many seconds remaining...\" -SecondsRemaining (3600 * $remaining)\r\n    Start-Sleep -Seconds 1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\nPowerShell 7.2 continues to format remaining runtime using a d.hh:mm:ss type format as is done by PowerShell 7.1 and earlier.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\nPowerShell 7.2.0-preview.6 displays the raw number of seconds remaining. This is OK for short tasks but seems needlessly user unfriendly for long running tasks. For example, yes, a user can read 11963s off the progress bar and do the math to find out completion is expected in 3 hours and 19 minutes. But it would be easier if 7.2 continued to display this as 03:19:12 like 7.1 does or used something like 3h19m.\r\n\r\nI don't see that a formatting option has been added to allow the new behavior to be overridden. Perhaps the new code is missing checks to switch formats when the remaining runtime exceeds 60 seconds?\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n```none\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
