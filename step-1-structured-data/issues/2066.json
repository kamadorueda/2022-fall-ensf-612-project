  "body": " The complete change series (see my spelling branch) was ~180 directories, ~850 words, ~1000 files, ~3400 changes. There's no good way to review such a thing, there are only different ways to slice it.\n\nNothing here should impact the build, however, there are a lot of files. In order to make it possible for me to exclude things which would have, I selectively included changes on a per-directory basis.\n\nThis means there are 34 commits, each of which should be fairly easy to review independently.\n\nIt is possible for me to squash them if requested, but I'd really like to avoid doing that until someone is absolutely confident they're about ready to accept it, otherwise merging, rebasing, and reviewing are all painful.\n\nAlso, if you really want each of the 34 changesets to be distinct PRs, I can do that, but it's approaching the limit of my work tolerance (I still have to produce changesets for comments in the src/System.Management.Automation directory, and then changesets for all the non-comments).\n\nThis is PR 4 of N:\n\nThe following is a list of some spelling fixes which have been made to the impacted files. It is not necessarily a complete list of changed words -- if a word is misspelled in code or resource strings the quick tool I used to list what's changed might say \"that's still present\" and not have highlighted it.\n- baseclass\n- blankspaces\n- cachemetadata\n- commandline\n- defaultcredential\n- erroraction\n- IDisposable\n- IEnumerable's\n- IFormattable's\n- JQuery\n- lifecycle\n- parameterset\n- persistable\n- Refactor\n- Thu\n- unsubscribe\n",
