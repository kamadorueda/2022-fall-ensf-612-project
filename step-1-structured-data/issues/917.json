  "body": "Resolves #914.\n\nThe [`PSReadLine/PSReadLine`](https://github.com/lzybkr/PSReadLine/tree/master/PSReadLine) subtree was imported to `src/PSReadLine`, and then @palladia's changes to the private fork of PSReadLine were applied on top.\n\nI added the `project.json` file necessary to build PSReadLine on Linux, as well as the (slightly modified) module files. PSReadLine is now built with PowerShell and imported by default (though the keybindings are not set, so it's not used until enabled).\n\nI also had to disable more snap-in code, thanks @lzybkr for the help.\n\n<!-- Reviewable:start -->\n\n---\n\nThis change is [<img src=\"https://reviewable.io/review_button.svg\" height=\"35\" align=\"absmiddle\" alt=\"Reviewable\"/>](https://reviewable.io/reviews/powershell/powershell/917)\n\n<!-- Reviewable:end -->\n",
