PowerShell throws an excpetion of not finding this assembly.\r\n\r\nIf I manually copy these files in the folder, everything works. (Another solution is to publish as Framework independent)\r\n\r\nThe AspNetCore application has no problems finding everything needed due to the deps.json file.\r\n\r\nSo my question is how to I tell PowerShell where to look for these references? Or probably the best solution, how to use the same mechanism the .NET Core application uses.\r\n\r\n",
