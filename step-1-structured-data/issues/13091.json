  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\nAttempting to change font in the PowerShell console.\r\nRight-clicked the PS icon at the top left-hand corner.\r\nClicked 'Properties' on the drop-down menu.\r\nSelected the 'Font' tab.\r\nSet font to 'Courier New' and size to 18.\r\n```\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\nFont and size will be changed.\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```An error message box is displayed: \"Unable to modify the shortcut: C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft\\Start Menu\\Programs\\PowerShell 7 (x64).lnk. Check to make sure it has not been deleted or renamed.\"\r\nThe shortcut does exist.\r\nIf I relax the shortcut's security restrictions, I can sucessfully change the font/size.\r\nBut the change does not apply to an Administrator-level console.\r\nThis must be changed separately.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```PS D:\\Users\\Tony> $PSVersionTable\r\n\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.2\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.2\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n\r\n```\r\n",
