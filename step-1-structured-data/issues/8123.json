      "body": "@daxian-dbw I understand that. What I'm saying is rather than expose the existing implementation, I would rather see work that replaces the existing implementation and finds some way to more closely wrap NewtonSoft, then expose that as an API. We have a bunch of open issues about lack of support for various things that come natural for NewtonSoft. I'm not discounting ETS, we obviously need to support it. But exposing an API for an implementation we know to be flawed is not my preferred path.",

      "body": "So I think what you describe is reasonable... but I think that's really a separate issue - \"make Convert*Json better by aligning closer to what NewtonSoft does\". And of course this issue is just - have another way to call ConvertTo-Json.\r\n\r\nI think a good first step of the eventual goal of what you describe is to move all the logic from the cmdlets into the API. Then the cmdlets would just call those APIs.\r\n\r\nFrom there, we can refactor the logic behind those cmdlets to make them better.",
