  "body": "This fixes the failing build on master. We don't install the dependencies or build packages for pull requests (there is no need, they cannot be uploaded and they take extra time) so only branch builds (e.g. merges to master) were failing.\n\nFPM was installing fine less than 24 hours ago. I'm chalking this up to Travis CI image changes and / or home brew changes.\n\nSwitching back to the stable Xcode image and explicitly using Ruby 2.2.1 (rather than attempting to install Ruby from home brew) fixes the problem. FPM installs just fine now. See https://travis-ci.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/jobs/46987178.\n",
