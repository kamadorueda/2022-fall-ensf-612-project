The test wait the child powershell process but not control Notepad. So the test really dont test Invoke-Item at all. Bug.\n\nI suggest using a custom association for custom file ext:\n\n```\n$testfile = \"testfile.!!testext!!\"\n$renamedtestfile = \"renamedtestfile.!!testext!!\"\nremove-item $renamedtestfile -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\nnew-item $testfile\ncmd.exe /c assoc .!!testext!!=!!testext!!.FileType\ncmd.exe /c ftype !!testext!!.FileType=cmd.exe /c rename $testfile $renamedtestfile\ninvoke-item $testfile\ntest-path $renamedtestfile | Should Be $true\ncmd.exe /c assoc !!testext!!=\ncmd.exe /c ftype !!testext!!.FileType=\nremove-item $testfile -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\nremove-item $renamedtestfile -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue\n```\n",

PowerShell delegates to cmd/xdg-open/open which then all launch what they determine to be the associated app. By the time the app is opened, PowerShell has zero knowledge of what it is.\n",

      "body": "I definitely remember having serious issues with this test, but it was written in response to a reported failure that was occurring on MacOS and Linux (and I believe Windows as well?).\n\nThe main problem I hit is that Invoke-Item has no return value, which means I can't get a PID back to close down what was opened. I can't guarantee the file association/process, nor do I think it's a good idea to alter those in any way on a user's system.\n\nIf anyone has an alternate solution, I think it would be fantastic, I agree it's not ideal at all.\n",

No way!\nThe current test causes any _**unknown**_ action. What if it's always print or beep? The current test will always be positive.\n\nWe need to know _**exactly the result**_ to verify its correctness (more precisely, correctness of an action that would lead to it).\n\nWe can either figure out the default action from OS, or configure it. The first option cannot help us, because the default actions usually cause an interactive process, which we can't verify. (We can check that Word is started but what if the Word pop up a interactive window \"Cannot open file\" because of  Invoke-Item send broken file name?) The second option is useful to us, because we can set a specific action (for example, rename the file) and exactly check the result.\n\nOf course we will have to make such a test separately for _**each**_ platform. I can make PR for Windows now.\n",
