  "body": "The automated builds for PowerShell nightly builds are failing on the Docker Store. Please fix this so that the nightly builds are successful. \r\n\r\nWhy is this useful? Well, I'd love to test out fixes as they go out, instead of waiting for new releases, but I also don't want to break the install of PowerShell Core on my Mac. Since I have Docker for Mac installed, the easiest way to test out new features is to pull the nightly container image, and run PowerShell Core inside of a Docker container. This will not impact my \"main\" install of PowerShell Core, while providing the ability to test out new features and contribute feedback back to the project.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1392\" alt=\"screen shot 2018-01-19 at 9 45 51 am\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/466713/35164086-cb306ff6-fcfd-11e7-8a5d-712cd12baaca.png\">\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nTrevor Sullivan",
