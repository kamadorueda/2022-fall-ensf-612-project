  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nGet the latest SLES15SP5 image. Try to install powershell using installpsh-suse.sh or install-powershell.sh script. It throws error saying OS is not supported.\r\n\r\nScript supports SLES15 but there is bad code in there which prevents the execution.  Below code for checking OS has been deprecated after SLES12 so it works for SLES12 but not for SLES15. We need to check for /etc/os-release to get the correct OS version.\r\n\r\n**elif [ -f /etc/SuSE-release ] ; then**\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\ninstallpsh-suse.sh or install-powershell.sh should install powershell on sles15.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\ninstallpsh-suse.sh or install-powershell.sh throws error on sles15 because of deprecated code being used.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n_No response_\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nlocalhost:~ # bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/tools/install-powershell.sh) suse\r\nGet-PowerShell MASTER Installer Version 1.2.0\r\nInstalls PowerShell and Optional The Development Environment\r\n  Original script is at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/master/tools\\install-powershell.psh\r\nArguments used: suse\r\n\r\nOperating System Details:\r\n  OS: linux\r\n  DIST:\r\n  DistroBasedOn:\r\n  PSUEDONAME:\r\n  REV:\r\n  KERNEL: 5.3.18-57-default\r\n  MACH: x86_64\r\n  OSSTR:\r\nSorry, your operating system is based on  and is not supported by PowerShell or this installer at this time.\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",
