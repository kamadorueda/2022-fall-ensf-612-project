      "body": "@markekraus may be able to speak to any original design intent here, but in general I tend to agree that giving the raw JSON response in the error isn't super helpful.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to say exactly what would be the most helpful way to represent it, given that there is absolutely no way to reason how any given API endpoint may choose to represent an error, _but_ I think at the very least doing something along the lines of `$errorJSON | ConvertFrom-Json | Out-String` would be a big improvement over the current error display.",
