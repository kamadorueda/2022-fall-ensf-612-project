  "body": "<!--\r\n\r\nFor Windows PowerShell 5.1 issues, suggestions, or feature requests please use the following link instead:\r\nWindows PowerShell [UserVoice](https://windowsserver.uservoice.com/forums/301869-powershell)\r\n\r\nThis repository is **ONLY** for PowerShell Core 6 and PowerShell 7+ issues.\r\n\r\n- Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\r\n- Search the existing issues.\r\n- Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\r\n- Refer to the [known issues](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/known-issues-ps6).\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Steps to reproduce\r\n### 1. Add the current directory ('.') to your the PATH variable\r\n```powershell\r\n   PS> $env:PATH = $env:PATH + ';.'\r\n```\r\nView the search directories\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n   PS> $env:Path -split ';'\r\n```\r\n### 2. Create a script in a test directory\r\n\r\nExample script:\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n    PS> Write-Output \"'Hello!'\" | Set-Content Show-Hello.ps1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### 3. Run the script from the cmd host.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\n   PS> Show-Hello\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nHello!\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nShow-Hello: The term 'Show-Hello' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.\r\nCheck the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.\r\n\r\nSuggestion [3,General]: The command Show-Hello was not found, but does exist in the current location. PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: \".\\Show-Hello\". See \"get-help about_Command_Precedence\" for more details.\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Environment data\r\n\r\n<!-- provide the output of $PSVersionTable -->\r\n\r\n```none\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.1.0\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.1.0\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19041\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",

This security check must have been added in the v7.1.0 release. \r\n\r\nTo work around this, current directory (.) to  $env:Path after opening PWSH.\r\n\r\nI will consider this issue resolved/closed.\r\n\r\nThanks all.",
