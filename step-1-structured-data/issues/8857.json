      "body": "After looking further into this, it seems that PS 6 is not honouring folder ACLs. The issue is not limited to special folders. I've had it on other folders where I'm a member of a group.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n\r\n1. Create a user group called `testgroup`. To create group, use app Computer Management, System Tools, Local Users and Groups. \r\n2. Make your user a member of it.\r\n3. Create a folder somewhere (`test-folder`).\r\n4. Permission that folder so that the `testgroup` group has full access but no other group has access. \r\n5. Goto the `test-folder` folder and try to create a folder in it. It fails.\r\n6. Change the permission on `test-folder` so that `Authenticated Users` have Full Control.\r\n7. Try to create a folder in `test-folder`. It will succeed.\r\n",
