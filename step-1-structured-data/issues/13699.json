The only real issue I ran into was that not all providers (the variable provider is one of these) support the `Content.Clear()` operation, so you do have to catch that and (probably) swap it for an `Item.Remove()` operation instead (if the provider supports that) if you want to be able to do `Set-Content` style things which clear data before writing.",

Nor should they be really, the content API's are super slow and allocate way too much.  It would be nice to have a fallback of sorts though:\r\n\r\n```csharp\r\n// sort of psuedo code that doesn't account for a lot of things\r\npublic static string ReadProviderItemAsString(this PSCmdlet cmdlet, string path)\r\n{\r\n    string providerPath = cmdlet.SessionState.Path.GetUnresolvedProviderPathFromPSPath(\r\n        path,\r\n        out ProviderInfo provider,\r\n        out _);\r\n\r\n    if (provider.Name is FileSystemProvider.ProviderName)\r\n    {\r\n        return File.ReadAllText(providerPath);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    using IContentReader reader = cmdlet.SessionState.InvokeProvider.Content.GetReader(\r\n        new[] { path },\r\n        force: true,\r\n        literalPath: true)[0];\r\n\r\n    var text = new StringBuilder();\r\n    bool first = true;\r\n    for (IList items = reader.Read(1); items is { Count: > 0 }; items = reader.Read(1))\r\n    {\r\n        foreach (object item in items)\r\n        {\r\n            if (first)\r\n            {\r\n                first = false;\r\n            }\r\n            else\r\n            {\r\n                text.AppendLine();\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            if (item is null)\r\n            {\r\n                continue;\r\n            }\r\n\r\n            text.Append(item);\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    return text.ToString();\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat said, there are theoretically providers that don't necessarily deal with string content.  So that might end up being a bunch of default `Object.ToString()` calls.\r\n\r\nThat also doesn't account for commands whose implementation might be able to work directly with a `FileStream`, or might call a native API that takes a file system path.",
