      "body": "I tweeted at Travis CI about the macOS build start fails this weekend. They responded saying there were no known issues. The macOS builds wnet from 100% not starting to something like 50% not starting. This has to be a Travis CI issue, as it can't be our code if our code never even runs.\r\n\r\nThe status write back from Travis CI has always been buggy when the time between build jobs is too long. What seems to be happening is that the Linux build starts and completes and then hours later the macOS build starts (or doesn't, take your pick) then Travis CI forgets all about the webhook. That's my best guess.\r\n\r\nWhen the time between the Linux build and macOS build are close, it seems to update the stats properly. \r\n\r\nIn any case, yes, this is very frustrating.",

And we do not have auto cancelation turned on\r\n\r\n@TravisEz13 What do you think about enabling auto cancellation? I think it would speed things up and make us a good Travis CI citizen. Busy PRs in this repo can some times pile up builds that no one cares about the status of. I think it would be a good idea to enable it for PR's at least.",
