This is enabled by default.  We should have a way to disable this if it causes problems for users.  Current proposal is to add a setting in powershell.config.json.\r\n\r\ncc @anmenaga ",

We should probably allow users to set this on a more granular basis if we can.\r\n\r\nAlso, do we have a cmdlet that can alter settings other than experimental features in the config.json currently?
