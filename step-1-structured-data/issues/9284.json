      "body": "@vexx32 No there isn't a standard for escaping control characters. That would be more like CTX: http://www.creativyst.com/Doc/Std/ctx/ctx.htm\r\n\r\nThere is a secondary standard which uses an escape character instead e.g. backslash before the newline; a bit like unix pipe delimited files. However this is not supposed to be mixed with quoted fields. i.e. you either quote or escape. A lot of csv parsers don't handle the quoted version though (they only handle the RFC4180 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180).\r\n\r\nIf you are asking about converting the newlines to something else e.g. \\r\\n then, no there is nothing standard about this. That is outside the scope of CSV since really it depends on the reader and writer of these files. Given PowerShell is such a good toolbelt then we could be looking to read and write csv written by many other applications as long as it conforms to RFC4180. Handling escapes would be nice but extra.",

If you use `-UseQuotes AsNeeded` then fields with newlines or quotes won't be formatted properly. As per @jsnape There is an accepted standard for escaping fields (RFC4180) that has the following relevant rule ([link](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4180#section-2)):\r\n\r\n\r\n> 6.  Fields containing line breaks (CRLF), double quotes, and commas\r\n>        should be enclosed in double-quotes.\r\n\r\nThe `Import-Csv` and `ConvertFrom-Csv` both correctly handle CSVs formatted in this standard. Additionally, it's the standard used by both Excel and Google Sheets, as well as the popular libraries [CsvHelper](https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/) and [fast-csv](https://github.com/C2FO/fast-csv).\r\n\r\nRelevant code:\r\n* [Format Headers](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/v7.2.0-preview.6/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/CsvCommands.cs#L970)\r\n* [Format Lines](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/v7.2.0-preview.6/src/Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.Utility/commands/utility/CsvCommands.cs#L1041)\r\n\r\nTo be RFC-4180 compliant you'd quote if you detect any newline characters (`\\r` or `\\n`), the escape character (i.e. `\"`) or the delimiter (i.e. `\"` or `\\t`).",
