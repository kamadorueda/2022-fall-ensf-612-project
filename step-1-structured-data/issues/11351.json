  "body": "I have some code which takes a -grid switch and sends output to Out-gridView rather than sending it back down the pipeline as normal. \r\nTo ensure the grid view closes when the test runs in a CI pipeline with no one watching, the test runs \r\n`PowerShell -command \"blah blah\" `\r\nIn recent previews of pwsh, out-gridview has returned. Which is **GREAT** My code works as it used to when run normally.  So now my test should be able to run \r\n`pwsh -command \"blah blah\"`\r\nBut now PowerShell waits for the grid view window to close before continuing. \r\nThis might be by design so that scripts which show a grid don't immediately close , taking the grid with them or it may be a bug\r\n\r\nRepro steps compare \r\n```powershell\r\n\r\npowershell -command \"ps | ogv ; sleep 5\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npwsh -command \"ps | ogv ; sleep 5\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Expected behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\nExpected to match\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```none\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Environment data\r\n\r\n```\r\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.0.0-preview.6\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.0.0-preview.6\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.18363\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\r\n```\r\n",
