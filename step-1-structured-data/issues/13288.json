Do you have instructions to get windows to use SSH?

When connecting using the `-HostName` and not the `-ComputerName` parameter for `Invoke-Command`/`Enter-PSSession` as that will use SSH and not WinRM.",

I'll start with testing username/password but probably will go to key based.\r\n\r\nI'll also report back if this is successful so that those whom come after me will know.

Name -like 'OpenSSH*'\r\nas i needed the client and server, but only really need the client as my use is Win to Lin: Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0\r\n\r\nthen i used the invoke and enter with the hostname versions. note: most of what i had is based on winRM and thus the commands look more like\r\n\r\nEnter-PSSession -HostName pingui.lab.ey -UserName a1234567-3\r\npgrep -f /app/pingidentity/pingaccess/jdk/current/bin/java | wc -l\r\nExit\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n$paFind = Invoke-Command -HostName pingui.lab.ey -UserName a1234567-3 -ScriptBlock { pgrep -f /app/pingidentity/pingaccess/jdk/current/bin/java | wc -l }\r\n\r\n\r\n@jborean93 thank you again for the assist!\r\n\r\n-Josh\n\n<blockquote><img src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/media/logos/logo-ms-social.png\" width=\"48\" align=\"right\"><div><strong><a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-core-on-linux\">Installing PowerShell on Linux - PowerShell</a></strong></div><div>Information about installing PowerShell on various Linux distributions</div></blockquote>\n<blockquote></blockquote>",
