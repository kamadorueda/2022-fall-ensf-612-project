  "body": "## Issue\r\nWhen running the package you get a message like this\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10873629/67424362-d6d3af80-f58a-11e9-9c59-1d837529bf8c.png)\r\n`\"powershell-7.0.0-preview.5-osx-x64.pkg\" can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software.`\r\n\r\n## Workaround - Finder\r\n\r\n1. Click Ok in the dialog.\r\n2. Find the package in Finder.\r\n3. Control Click (click while holding the `ctrt` key) on the package icon.\r\n4. Click open on the context menu that comes up.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10873629/67424786-a6404580-f58b-11e9-9a5d-8ce796259d94.png)\r\n\r\n## Workaround - Command Line\r\n\r\n1. run `sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine <path to package>`, replace `<path to package>` with the actual path to the `.pkg` file.\r\n2. Then install the package as you normally would.\r\n\r\n## Required changes\r\n```\r\n1.       Opt-in to use runtime hardening when developing your app.\r\na.       Insert the following key by editing your info.plist: CSFlags of type int, 65536 is the hardening value\r\n                <key>CSFlags>\r\n                <integer>65536</integer>\r\n                                       i.            Create entitlements file\r\n                                     ii.            Pass a directive to codesign with entitlements file\r\nSame entitlements file and syntax are used for both hardening and sandboxing but they are orthogonal to each other.\r\n```",
