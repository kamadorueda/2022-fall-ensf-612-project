  "body": "# PR Summary\r\n\r\nWe use the property names 'Light***' such as `LightRed` and `LightGreen` for VT sequences that [are documented](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences#text-formatting) as \"Bright Foreground \\<color\\>\" and \"Bright Background \\<color\\>\", such as 'Bright Red' and 'Bright Green'. This is misleading, we should make the property names consistent with those in the documentation, so it's more intuitive for users to work with VT color in PowerShell.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/e98a8c8601b8f15f479e894323beafb9f6a2300c/src/System.Management.Automation/FormatAndOutput/common/PSStyle.cs#L78-L88\r\n\r\n## More Context\r\n\r\nThe names were originally copied from the \"command-line-api\" repo [from `System.CommandLine.Rendering.Color+Foreground` and `System.CommandLine.Rendering.Color+Background`](https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/blob/cfefdc7a44f3682b626a8953976650ed91879e7e/src/System.CommandLine.Rendering/Ansi.cs#L29). Now it's been confirmed that those properties were misnamed in that repo and will be fixed there, see https://github.com/dotnet/command-line-api/issues/1438.\r\n\r\nSo we should fix in PowerShell as well, before 7.2 GA.\r\n\r\n## PR Checklist\r\n\r\n- [x] [PR has a meaningful title](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n    - Use the present tense and imperative mood when describing your changes\r\n- [x] [Summarized changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] [Make sure all `.h`, `.cpp`, `.cs`, `.ps1` and `.psm1` files have the correct copyright header](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n- [x] This PR is ready to merge and is not [Work in Progress](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---work-in-progress).\r\n    - If the PR is work in progress, please add the prefix `WIP:` or `[ WIP ]` to the beginning of the title (the `WIP` bot will keep its status check at `Pending` while the prefix is present) and remove the prefix when the PR is ready.\r\n- **[Breaking changes](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#making-breaking-changes)**\r\n    - [x] breaking changes to 7.2 preview versions\r\n- **User-facing changes**\r\n    - [ ] Not Applicable\r\n    - **OR**\r\n    - [x] [Documentation needed](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#pull-request---submission)\r\n        - [x] PR submitted: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/PowerShell-Docs/pull/8206",

That's why it's called \"preview\".  Once it hits RC or especially any sort of \"go live\" designation, then you shouldn't introduce a breaking change unless it meets a very high bar.",
