  "body": "### Prerequisites\n\n- [X] Write a descriptive title.\n- [X] Make sure you are able to repro it on the [latest released version](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)\n- [X] Search the existing issues.\n- [X] Refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md).\n- [X] Refer to [Differences between Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/whats-new/differences-from-windows-powershell).\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n\nWhen trying to navigate to `$env:temp` i get the error message `Set-Location: An object at the specified path C:\\Users\\B536F~1.SCH does not exist.`\r\n\r\nThe value of `$env:temp` is `C:\\Users\\B536F~1.SCH\\AppData\\Local\\Temp` the full path (non 8.3) is `C:\\Users\\b.schmidt\\AppData\\Local\\Temp`.\r\n\r\nThis issue is also present in older PowerShell 5.1 and known there for years, but was never fixed.\r\nIf you fix it in PowerShell 7 it might be worth fixing it also in 5.1.\r\n\r\nAs far as i remember the issue is that the 8.3 version `B536F~1.SCH` is longer than the original `b.schmidt`.\r\nFor comparison:\r\n```\r\nB536F~1.SCH (11 chars)\r\nb.schmidt (9 chars)\r\n```\n\n### Expected behavior\n\n```console\nSuccessful navigation without any error.\n```\n\n\n### Actual behavior\n\n```console\nNo navigation and an error message.\n```\n\n\n### Error details\n\n```console\nException             :\r\n    Type        : System.Management.Automation.PSArgumentException\r\n    ErrorRecord :\r\n        Exception             :\r\n            Type    : System.Management.Automation.ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n            Message : An object at the specified path C:\\Users\\B536F~1.SCH does not exist.\r\n            HResult : -2146233087\r\n        CategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [], ParentContainsErrorRecordException\r\n        FullyQualifiedErrorId : Argument\r\n    Message     : An object at the specified path C:\\Users\\B536F~1.SCH does not exist.\r\n    ParamName   : path\r\n    TargetSite  :\r\n        Name          : NormalizeThePath\r\n        DeclaringType : Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.FileSystemProvider\r\n        MemberType    : Method\r\n        Module        : System.Management.Automation.dll\r\n    Source      : System.Management.Automation\r\n    HResult     : -2147024809\r\n    StackTrace  :\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.FileSystemProvider.NormalizeThePath(String basepath, Stack`1 tokenizedPathStack)\r\n   at Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.FileSystemProvider.NormalizeRelativePathHelper(String path, String basePath)\r\nCategoryInfo          : InvalidArgument: (:) [Set-Location], PSArgumentException\r\nFullyQualifiedErrorId : Argument,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.SetLocationCommand\r\nInvocationInfo        :\r\n    MyCommand        : Set-Location\r\n    ScriptLineNumber : 1\r\n    OffsetInLine     : 1\r\n    HistoryId        : 2\r\n    Line             : cd $env:temp\r\n    PositionMessage  : At line:1 char:1\r\n                       + cd $env:temp\r\n                       + ~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n    InvocationName   : cd\r\n    CommandOrigin    : Internal\r\nScriptStackTrace      : at <ScriptBlock>, <No file>: line 1\n```\n\n\n### Environment data\n\n```powershell\nName                           Value\r\n----                           -----\r\nPSVersion                      7.2.3\r\nPSEdition                      Core\r\nGitCommitId                    7.2.3\r\nOS                             Microsoft Windows 10.0.19042\r\nPlatform                       Win32NT\r\nPSCompatibleVersions           {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0\u2026}\r\nPSRemotingProtocolVersion      2.3\r\nSerializationVersion           1.1.0.1\r\nWSManStackVersion              3.0\n```\n\n\n### Visuals\n\n_No response_",

      "body": "> we just delegate to the operating system / .NET APIs to resolve the path\r\n\r\nThat does not seem to be true. Having a look at `FileSystemProvider.cs` there is a lot going on before a path reaches the operating system or .NET APIs.\r\nThe culprit should be here:\r\nhttps://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/blob/65d8f11aebbdb49b7e28af026d84bf1d38705d37/src/System.Management.Automation/namespaces/FileSystemProvider.cs#L5642\r\n\r\nI don't know how to activate tracing for PowerShell. But the tracing output should show that the culprit is there.\r\n\r\n> If the TEMP var contains a non usable path there's not much we can do.\r\n\r\nThe path is totally valid and doing a `cd %temp%` in a batch is not an issue.\r\nUsing .NET APIs with that path is not an issue.\r\nSo it's clearly a PowerShell issue.\r\n\r\n> I'm not sure how you got an 8.3 path like that into your TEMP variable or what caused it (generally as far as I'm aware 8.3 paths aren't used if the name is sufficiently short, so it's odd that the path was recorded in that way)\r\n\r\nThat's done by windows itself. Try it yourself. Create a new local user account on your machine with the username \"b.schmidt\" and viola, your user directory is `C:\\Users\\B536F~1.SCH`.",

As FullName would be `C:\\Users\\b.schmidt` and current would be `C:\\Users\\B536F~1.SCH` (as far as i can tell from just reading the code).",
