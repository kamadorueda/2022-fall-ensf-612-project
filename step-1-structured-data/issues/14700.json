  "body": "If you look at the parameters of Get-ChildItem, there's an alias:\r\n\r\n```PowerShell\r\n> (Get-Command Get-ChildItem).Parameters[\"Directory\"].Aliases\r\nad\r\nd\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the `d` alias **CANNOT** ever work, because the `Directory` parameter is dynamic, and `Get-ChildItem` already has a parameter that starts with \"d\" (the \"Depth\" parameter), so the `-d` switch always gets bound to the `-Depth` parameter (and the user gets prompted for an actual value).\r\n\r\nCan we remove that alias, since it's just confusing users?",

      "body": "Good point, previously reported in #4739 (I've just closed the latter, because this issue is more focused).\r\n\r\nGiven that binding to the _static_ parameters seemingly always takes precedence, the lessons to be drawn for future cmdlets are:\r\n\r\n* Do not define aliases for _dynamic_ parameters that are prefix matches of the _static_ parameter names / aliases, because the latter will preempt the former.\r\n\r\n  * _Ideally_ - I don't know if it's feasible, given that it could only be detected at runtime - cmdlets would detect this condition and report an error.\r\n\r\n* Static parameters taking precedence makes sense conceptually, especially in the context of provider cmdlets, so that, say, `-d` is _always_ `-Depth`, irrespective of what provider is targeted, and not _situationally_ either `-Depth`  or `-Directory`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
