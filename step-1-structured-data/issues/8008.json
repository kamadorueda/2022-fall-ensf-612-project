How many users have been affected in that six months which would have greatly benefited from a simple note on the instructions page that says, 'these instructions don't work right now' or 'this is the proper way to do this'?\r\n\r\nWhat kind of bureaucratic mess is powershell in when a simple request to update a page with bad information takes longer than 6 months?  The OP was answered with \"It's not our fault!\" but that's BS because inaccurate documentation is our fault regardless of the underlying cause of the problem.  As another user affected by the bad instructions I have wasted a half hour researching why the official instructions don't work and what to do about it and what are the security implications of doing things that are not listed in the official instructions.  The snap install on my system throws scary warnings about it dong bad security stuff.  I'm off to research--oh wait.  work is calling. Guess I'll give up on powershell for now.  Maybe next month.\r\n\r\nAgain, ridiculous and a waste of everyone's time.",
