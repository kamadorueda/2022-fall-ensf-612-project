  "body": "This is related to the recent change made in PR #12960\r\n\r\nI was reviewing this PR to understand the change needed in the documentation. I also looked at the source code and find that the pattern used by the parameters is confusing. The switch parameters are all optional but are used to define the unique ParameterSet. So, they are mandatory for that parameter set.\r\n\r\n```powershell\r\nPS C:\\temp\\test> syntax Split-Path | ft -w\r\n\r\nCmdlet     ParameterSetName Parameters\r\n------     ---------------- ----------\r\nSplit-Path ParentSet        [-Path] <string[]> [-Parent] [-Resolve] [-Credential <pscredential>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\nSplit-Path LeafSet          [-Path] <string[]> [-Leaf] [-Resolve] [-Credential <pscredential>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\nSplit-Path LeafBaseSet      [-Path] <string[]> [-LeafBase] [-Resolve] [-Credential <pscredential>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\nSplit-Path ExtensionSet     [-Path] <string[]> [-Extension] [-Resolve] [-Credential <pscredential>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\nSplit-Path QualifierSet     [-Path] <string[]> [-Qualifier] [-Resolve] [-Credential <pscredential>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\nSplit-Path NoQualifierSet   [-Path] <string[]> [-NoQualifier] [-Resolve] [-Credential <pscredential>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\nSplit-Path IsAbsoluteSet    [-Path] <string[]> [-Resolve] [-IsAbsolute] [-Credential <pscredential>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\nSplit-Path LiteralPathSet   -LiteralPath <string[]> [-Resolve] [-Credential <pscredential>] [<CommonParameters>]\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the parameters should be changed to `Mandatory = true`. Are there any risks created by that change?\r\n\r\nAs a secondary question, what is the use-case scenario for allowing `ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName` on those switch parameters? Seems like a strange use case and hard to document.\r\n",

I'm not seeing anything that jumps out to me about Split-Path in that PR.",

      "body": "I do not think there are any risks\u2014but I think that the change you request is inconsistent with the concept.  The command operates in several modes and one mode is the default, so the switch to that mode is optional.  However, the decision *which mode is the default* is arbitrary, and while it would be an unwanted breaking change to change it, it is only caused by the inertia of the code base and not by any inherent special property of the default mode that makes it the default.  After this change, any attempt to change the default mode (e.g. in a fork) would involve tweaking the mandatory statuses.  I can see no value in doing this.\r\n* What is wrong with writing that all parameters are optional?  \r\n\r\nI think that the general rule that parameter set leaders should be mandatory is misleading to the users.  Since I, as a user, have a free choice of which parameter set to use, I perceive the corresponding leading switch as **optional**.  The fact that it is **necessary** for the parameter set to be used does not make it **mandatory**.\r\nCompare the usual privacy statement: you are not *compelled* to give us your data, but *unless* you do, you *will not be able* to use our services.  It is the same pattern.",

The syntax diagrams are currently far more confusing than they need to be, it's not clear which set is actually which (they all look _really_ similar). Marking the mode switches as mandatory in their set will just make the syntax diagrams clearer without actually changing the underlying behaviour.\r\n\r\nI agree that the following meta-syntax is awkward and confusing:\r\n```\r\nRun-Command [-ChooseParamSet1] [-OtherParams]\r\nRun-Command [-ChooseParamSet2] [-OtherParams]\r\n\u2026\r\n```\r\nand that the meta-syntax that shows parameter set triggers as mandatory\r\n```\r\nRun-Command -ChooseParamSet1 [-OtherParams]\r\nRun-Command -ChooseParamSet2 [-OtherParams]\r\n\u2026\r\n```\r\nwould be more correct and appealing.\r\n\r\nHowever, there may be several trigger parameters for a parameter set.  For example, in Pester, it would be fully reasonable if `Should -ErrorId:\u2026` implied `-Throw`.  That would make both parameters `Throw` and `ErrorId` optional, so your solution to this problem is not only logically incorrect but also partial in practice.  It would be better to explicitly mark parameter set triggers rather than make them all mandatory, which, as I have said, you cannot always do.\r\n\r\nIMVHO.\r\n",
