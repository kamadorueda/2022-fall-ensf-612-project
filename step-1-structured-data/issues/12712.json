  "body": "# Summary of the new feature/enhancement\r\n\r\nYou may want to create files with the newline LF in Windows.  It is inconvenient to create such files by PowerShell in Windows.  You have to run the following to do so:\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\n[IO.File]::WriteAllText(\"$PWD\\foo.txt\", $ContentLines -join \"`n\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis looks ugly.  It would be nice if `Out-File` of PowerShell supports the LF newline as it supported UTF-8 without BOM.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what the problem is that the new feature would solve.\r\nTry formulating it in user story style (if applicable):\r\n'As a user I want X so that Y.' with X being the being the action and Y being the value of the action.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Proposed technical implementation details (optional)\r\n\r\nI'd like the following syntax for creating UTF-8 (w/o BOM) + LF files.\r\n\r\n```pwsh\r\nOut-File foo.txt -Encoding utf8NoBOM -Newline LF\r\n```\r\n\r\nI wish this proposed option `-Newline` takes one of the values `CRLF`, `LF`, and `Native` (or `Auto`).\r\n\r\nP.S. `Tee-Object` may also requires this option.\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nA clear and concise description of what you want to happen.\r\nConsider providing an example PowerShell experience with expected result.\r\n-->\r\n",
